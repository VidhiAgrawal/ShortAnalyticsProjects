       "'\\nKate Atkinson MBE (born 20 December 1951) is an English writer of novels, plays and short stories.[1] She is known for creating the Jackson Brodie series of detective novels, which has been adapted into the BBC One series Case Histories.[1][2] She won the Whitbread Book of the Year prize in 1995 in the Novels category for Behind the Scenes at the Museum, winning again in 2013 and 2015 under its new name the Costa Book Awards.[1]\\nThe daughter of a shopkeeper, Atkinson was born in York, the setting for several of her books.[3] She studied English literature at the University of Dundee, gaining her master\\'s degree in 1974.[1] Atkinson subsequently studied for a doctorate in American literature, with a thesis titled \"The post-modern American short story in its historical context\".[3] She failed at the viva (oral examination) stage. After leaving the university, she took on a variety of jobs, from home help to legal secretary and teacher.[4]\\nHer first novel, Behind the Scenes at the Museum, won the 1995 Whitbread Book of the Year and went on to be a Sunday Times bestseller.  Since then, she has published further novels, as well as plays and short stories.[1][5]\\nSome of her books are part of a series of novels, starting with Case Histories, which feature the character of Jackson Brodie as a private investigator and former police inspector.[1] \\nAtkinson has criticised the media\\'s coverage of her work\\xa0–  when she won the Whitbread award, for example, it was the fact that she was a \"single mother\" who lived outside London that received the most attention.[6] In a 2018 interview she declared that she did not spend time in great literary parties or the London high life.[6]\\nIn 2009, she donated the short story \"Lucky We Live Now\" to Oxfam\\'s Ox-Tales project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Atkinson\\'s story was published in the Earth collection.[7][8]\\nIn March 2010, Atkinson appeared at the York Literature Festival, giving a world-premier reading from an early chapter from her novel Started Early, Took My Dog (2010), which is set mainly in the English city of Leeds.\\nAtkinson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to literature.[9] On 30 November 2018, she was the guest on BBC Radio 4\\'s Desert Island Discs.[6]\\nThe first four Jackson Brodie novels have been adapted by other writers for the BBC under the series titled Case Histories, featuring Jason Isaacs as Brodie.[2]\\nIn 2015 in the United States, Shonda Rhimes was in the process of developing a pilot called The Catch, based on a treatment written by Atkinson, and starring Mireille Enos.[14][15]\\nHer 2013 novel Life After Life was screened as a BBC drama of the same name in 2022, with Thomasin McKenzie in the role of Ursula.[16]\\nAtkinson has been married twice: while a student, to the father of her first daughter Eve, and subsequently to the father of her second daughter Helen.[3]\\nAtkinson lived in Whitby, North Yorkshire,[8] for a time, but now lives in Edinburgh.[5]\\n'"

       "['Mario Acevedo (born July 6, 1955) is an American novelist and artist, known for his series of urban fantasy novels featuring the vampire private investigator Felix Gomez.  He lives and works in Denver, Colorado.[1] Acevedo was born in El Paso, Texas.[2][page\\xa0needed] Before becoming a published writer, Acevedo held jobs as a military helicopter pilot, paratrooper, infantry officer, engineer, art teacher, software programmer, and assorted others.[2] He was also deployed as a soldier and artist for the U.S. Army during Operation Desert Storm.[2]\\n\\nThis article about a novelist of the United States born in the 1950s is a stub.

       " '\\nDouglas Noël Adams (11 March 1952 – 11 May 2001) was an English author, humorist, and screenwriter, best known for The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy. Originally a 1978 BBC radio comedy, The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy developed into a \"trilogy\" of five books that sold more than 15\\xa0million copies in his lifetime. It was further developed into a television series, several stage plays, comics, a video game, and a 2005 feature film. Adams\\'s contribution to UK radio is commemorated in The Radio Academy\\'s Hall of Fame.[2]\\nAdams also wrote Dirk Gently\\'s Holistic Detective Agency (1987) and The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul (1988), and co-wrote The Meaning of Liff (1983), The Deeper Meaning of Liff (1990) and Last Chance to See (1990). He wrote two stories for the television series Doctor Who, co-wrote City of Death (1979), and served as script editor for its seventeenth season. He co-wrote the sketch \"Patient Abuse\" for the final episode of Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus. A posthumous collection of his selected works, including the first publication of his final (unfinished) novel, was published as The Salmon of Doubt in 2002.\\nAdams was a self-proclaimed \"radical atheist\", an advocate for environmentalism and conservation, and a lover of fast cars,[3] technological innovation and the Apple Macintosh.\\nAdams was born in Cambridge on 11 March 1952 to Christopher Douglas Adams (1927–1985), a management consultant and computer salesman, former probation officer and lecturer on probationary group therapy techniques, and nurse Janet (1927–2016), née Donovan.[4][5] The family moved a few months after his birth to the East End of London, where his sister, Susan, was born three years later.[6] His parents divorced in 1957; Douglas, Susan and their mother moved then to an RSPCA animal shelter in Brentwood, Essex, run by his maternal grandparents.[7] Each remarried, giving Adams four half-siblings. A great-grandfather was the playwright Benjamin Franklin Wedekind.[8]\\nAdams attended Primrose Hill Primary School in Brentwood. At the age of nine, he passed the entrance exam for Brentwood School. He attended the prep school from 1959 to 1964, then the main school until December 1970. Adams was 6 feet (1.8\\xa0m) tall by age 12, and stopped growing at 6\\xa0feet 5\\xa0inches (1.96\\xa0m). His form master, Frank Halford, said that Adams\\'s height had made him stand out and that he had been self-conscious about it.[9][10] His ability to write stories made him well known in the school.[11] Adams became the only student ever to be awarded a ten out of ten by Halford for creative writing – something he remembered for the rest of his life, particularly when facing writer\\'s block.[6]\\nSome of his earliest writing was published at the school, such as a report on its photography club in The Brentwoodian in 1962, or spoof reviews in the school magazine Broadsheet, edited by Paul Neil Milne Johnstone, who later became a character in The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide. He also designed the cover of one issue of the Broadsheet, and had a letter and short story published in The Eagle, the boys\\' comic, in 1965. A poem entitled \"A Dissertation on the task of writing a poem on a candle and an account of some of the difficulties thereto pertaining\" written by Adams in January 1970 at the age of 17, was discovered in a cupboard at the school in early 2014.[12]\\nOn the strength of an essay on religious poetry that discussed the Beatles and William Blake, he was awarded an Exhibition in English at St John\\'s College, Cambridge (where his father had also been a student),[13] going up in 1971. He wanted to join the Footlights, an invitation-only student comedy club that has acted as a hothouse for comic talent. He was not elected immediately as he had hoped, and started to write and perform in revues with Will Adams (no relation) and Martin Smith; they formed a group called \"Adams-Smith-Adams\". He became a member of the Footlights by 1973.[14] Despite doing very little work – he recalled having completed three essays in three years – he graduated in 1974 with a 2:2 in English literature.[15]\\nAfter leaving university Adams moved back to London, determined to break into TV and radio as a writer. An edited version of the Footlights Revue appeared on BBC2 television in 1974. A version of the Revue performed live in London\\'s West End led to Adams being discovered by Monty Python\\'s Graham Chapman. The two formed a brief writing partnership, earning Adams a writing credit in episode 45 of Monty Python for a sketch called \"Patient Abuse\". The pair also co-wrote the \"Marilyn Monroe\" sketch which appeared on the soundtrack album of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Adams is one of only two people other than the original Python members to get a writing credit (the other being Neil Innes).[16]\\nAdams had two brief appearances in the fourth series of Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus. At the beginning of episode 42, \"The Light Entertainment War\", Adams is in a surgeon\\'s mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while Michael Palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another but never gets started.[citation needed] At the beginning of episode 44, \"Mr. Neutron\", Adams is dressed in a pepper-pot outfit and loads a missile onto a cart driven by Terry Jones, who is calling for scrap metal (\"Any old iron...\").[citation needed] The two episodes were broadcast in November 1974.[citation needed]  Adams and Chapman also attempted non-Python projects, including Out of the Trees.[17]\\nAt this point Adams\\'s career stalled; his writing style was unsuited to the then-current style of radio and TV comedy.[5] To make ends meet he took a series of odd jobs, including as a hospital porter, barn builder, and chicken shed cleaner. He was employed as a bodyguard by a Qatari family, who had made their fortune in oil.[18]\\nDuring this time Adams continued to write and submit sketches, though few were accepted. In 1976 his career had a brief improvement when he wrote and performed Unpleasantness at Brodie\\'s Close at the Edinburgh Fringe festival. By Christmas, work had dried up again, and a depressed Adams moved to live with his mother.[5] The lack of writing work hit him hard and low confidence became a feature of Adams\\'s life; \"I have terrible periods of lack of confidence [...] I briefly did therapy, but after a while I realised it was like a farmer complaining about the weather. You can\\'t fix the weather\\xa0– you just have to get on with it\".[19]\\nSome of Adams\\'s early radio work included sketches for The Burkiss Way in 1977 and The News Huddlines.[20] He also wrote, again with Chapman, the 20 February 1977 episode of Doctor on the Go, a sequel to the Doctor in the House television comedy series. After the first radio series of The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide became successful, Adams was made a BBC radio producer, working on Week Ending and a pantomime called Black Cinderella Two Goes East.[21] He left after six months to become the script editor for Doctor Who.\\nIn 1979, Adams and John Lloyd wrote scripts for two half-hour episodes of Doctor Snuggles: \"The Remarkable Fidgety River\" and \"The Great Disappearing Mystery\" (episodes eight and twelve).[22] John Lloyd was also co-author of two episodes from the original Hitchhiker radio series (\"Fit the Fifth\" and \"Fit the Sixth\", also known as \"Episode Five\" and \"Episode Six\"), as well as The Meaning of Liff and The Deeper Meaning of Liff.\\nAdams sent the script for the HHGG pilot radio programme to the Doctor Who production office in 1978, and was commissioned to write The Pirate Planet. He had also previously attempted to submit a potential film script, called Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen, which later became his novel Life, the Universe and Everything (which in turn became the third Hitchhiker\\'s Guide radio series). Adams then went on to serve as script editor on the show for its seventeenth season in 1979. Altogether, he wrote three Doctor Who serials starring Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor:\\nThe episodes authored by Adams are some of the few that were not originally novelised, as Adams would not allow anyone else to write them and asked for a higher price than the publishers were willing to pay.[26] Shada was later adapted as a novel by Gareth Roberts in 2012 and City of Death and The Pirate Planet by James Goss in 2015 and 2017 respectively.\\nElements of Shada and City of Death were reused in Adams\\'s later novel Dirk Gently\\'s Holistic Detective Agency, in particular, the character of Professor Chronotis. Big Finish Productions eventually remade Shada as an audio play starring Paul McGann as the Doctor. Accompanied by partially animated illustrations, it was webcast on the BBC website in 2003, and subsequently released as a two-CD set later that year. An omnibus edition of this version was broadcast on the digital radio station BBC7 on 10 December 2005.\\nIn the Doctor Who 2012 Christmas episode \"The Snowmen\", writer Steven Moffat was inspired by a storyline that Adams pitched called The Doctor Retires.[27]\\nThe Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy was a concept for a science-fiction comedy radio series pitched by Adams and radio producer Simon Brett to BBC Radio 4 in 1977. Adams came up with an outline for a pilot episode, as well as a few other stories (reprinted in Neil Gaiman\\'s book Don\\'t Panic: The Official Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy Companion) that could be used in the series.\\nAccording to Adams, the idea for the title occurred to him while he lay drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria, gazing at the stars. He was carrying a copy of the Hitch-hiker\\'s Guide to Europe, and it occurred to him that \"somebody ought to write a Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy\".[28]\\nDespite the original outline, Adams was said to make up the stories as he wrote. He turned to John Lloyd for help with the final two episodes of the first series. Lloyd contributed bits from an unpublished science fiction book of his own, called GiGax.[29] Very little of Lloyd\\'s material survived in later adaptations of Hitchhiker\\'s, such as the novels and the TV series. The TV series was based on the first six radio episodes, and sections contributed by Lloyd were largely re-written.\\nBBC Radio 4 broadcast the first radio series weekly in the UK starting 8 March 1978, lasting until April.[30] The series was distributed in the United States by National Public Radio. Following the success of the first series, another episode was recorded and broadcast, which was commonly known as the Christmas Episode. A second series of five episodes was broadcast one per night, during the week of 21–25 January 1980.\\nWhile working on the radio series (and with simultaneous projects such as The Pirate Planet) Adams developed problems keeping to writing deadlines that got worse as he published novels. Adams was never a prolific writer and usually had to be forced by others to do any writing. This included being locked in a hotel suite with his editor for three weeks to ensure that So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish was completed.[31] He was quoted as saying, \"I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.\"[32] Despite the difficulty with deadlines, Adams wrote five novels in the series, published in 1979, 1980, 1982, 1984, and 1992.\\nThe books formed the basis for other adaptations, such as three-part comic book adaptations for each of the first three books, an interactive text-adventure computer game, and a photo-illustrated edition, published in 1994. This latter edition featured a 42 Puzzle designed by Adams, which was later incorporated into paperback covers of the first four Hitchhiker\\'s novels (the paperback for the fifth re-used the artwork from the hardback edition).[33]\\nIn 1980, Adams began attempts to turn the first Hitchhiker\\'s novel into a film, making several trips to Los Angeles, and working with Hollywood studios and potential producers. The next year, the radio series became the basis for a BBC television mini-series[34] broadcast in six parts. When he died in 2001 in California, he had been trying again to get the film project started with Disney, which had bought the rights in 1998. The screenplay got a posthumous re-write by Karey Kirkpatrick, and the resulting film was released in 2005.\\nRadio producer Dirk Maggs had consulted with Adams, first in 1993, and later in 1997 and 2000 about creating a third radio series, based on the third novel in the Hitchhiker\\'s series.[35] They also discussed the possibilities of radio adaptations of the final two novels in the five-book \"trilogy\". As with the film, this project was realised only after Adams\\'s death. The third series, The Tertiary Phase, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in September 2004 and was subsequently released on audio CD. With the aid of a recording of his reading of Life, the Universe and Everything and editing, Adams can be heard playing the part of Agrajag posthumously. So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish and Mostly Harmless made up the fourth and fifth radio series, respectively (on radio they were titled The Quandary Phase and The Quintessential Phase) and these were broadcast in May and June 2005, and also subsequently released on Audio CD. The last episode in the last series (with a new, \"more upbeat\" ending) concluded with, \"The very final episode of The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is affectionately dedicated to its author.\"[36]\\nBetween Adams\\'s first trip to Madagascar with Mark Carwardine in 1985, and their series of travels that formed the basis for the radio series and non-fiction book Last Chance to See, Adams wrote two other novels with a new cast of characters. Dirk Gently\\'s Holistic Detective Agency was published in 1987, and was described by its author as \"a kind of ghost-horror-detective-time-travel-romantic-comedy-epic, mainly concerned with mud, music and quantum mechanics\".[37]\\nA sequel, The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul, was published a year later. This was an entirely original work, Adams\\'s first since So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish. After the book tour, Adams set off on his round-the-world excursion which supplied him with the material for Last Chance to See.\\nThe Salmon of Doubt was incomplete when published posthumously.\\nAdams played the guitar left-handed and had a collection of twenty-four left-handed guitars when he died (having received his first guitar in 1964). He also studied piano in the 1960s.[38] Pink Floyd and Procol Harum had important influence on Adams\\'s work.\\nAdams\\'s official biography shares its name with the song \"Wish You Were Here\" by Pink Floyd. The opening section of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" was featured in a section of the third episode of the original 1978 Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy radio series (broadcast only, cut from commercial releases). Adams was friends with Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour and, on Adams\\'s 42nd birthday, he was invited to make a guest appearance at Pink Floyd\\'s concert of 28 October 1994 at Earls Court in London, playing guitar on the songs \"Brain Damage\" and \"Eclipse\".[39] Adams chose the name for Pink Floyd\\'s 1994 album, The Division Bell, by picking the words from the lyrics to one of its tracks, \"High Hopes\".[39] Pink Floyd and the song \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\" in particular, inspired Adams to create the rock band Disaster Area who appear in The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, who planned to crash a space ship into a nearby star as a stunt during a concert.[40] Gilmour also performed at Adams\\'s memorial service in 2001, and what would have been Adams\\'s 60th birthday party in 2012.[41]\\nDouglas Adams created an interactive fiction version of HHGG with Steve Meretzky from Infocom in 1984. In 1986 he participated in a week-long brainstorming session with the Lucasfilm Games team for the game Labyrinth. Later he was also involved in creating Bureaucracy as a parody of events in his own life.\\nAdams was a founder-director and Chief Fantasist of The Digital Village, a digital media and Internet company with which he created Starship Titanic, a Codie award-winning and BAFTA-nominated adventure game, which was published in 1998 by Simon & Schuster.[42][43] Terry Jones wrote the accompanying book, entitled Douglas Adams\\' Starship Titanic, since Adams was too busy with the computer game to do both. In April 1999, Adams initiated the h2g2 collaborative writing project, an experimental attempt at making The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy a reality, and at harnessing the collective brainpower of the internet community. It was hosted by BBC Online from 2001 to 2011.[42]\\nIn 1990, Adams wrote and presented a television documentary programme Hyperland[44] which featured Tom Baker as a \"software agent\" (similar to the assistant pictured in Apple\\'s Knowledge Navigator video of future concepts from 1987), and interviews with Ted Nelson, the co-inventor of hypertext and the person who coined the term. Adams was an early adopter and advocate of hypertext.\\nAdams described himself as a \"radical atheist\", adding \"radical\" for emphasis so he would not be asked if he meant agnostic. He told American Atheists that this conveyed the fact that he really meant it. He imagined a sentient puddle who wakes up one morning and thinks, \"This is an interesting world I find myself in – an interesting hole I find myself in – fits me rather neatly, doesn\\'t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!\" to express his disbelief in the fine-tuned universe argument for God.[45]\\nHe remained fascinated by religion because of its effect on human affairs. \"I love to keep poking and prodding at it. I\\'ve thought about it so much over the years that that fascination is bound to spill over into my writing.\"[46]\\nThe evolutionary biologist and atheist Richard Dawkins invited Adams to participate in his 1991 Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, where Dawkins calls Adams from the audience to read a passage from The Restaurant at the End of the Universe which satirizes the absurdity of the thought that any one species would exist on Earth merely to serve as a meal to another species, such as humans.[47] Dawkins also uses Adams\\'s influence to exemplify arguments for non-belief in his 2006 book The God Delusion. Dawkins dedicated the book to Adams, whom he jokingly called \"possibly [my] only convert\" to atheism[48] and wrote on his death that \"Science has lost a friend, literature has lost a luminary, the mountain gorilla and the black rhino have lost a gallant defender.\"[49]\\nAdams was also an environmental activist who campaigned on behalf of endangered species. This activism included the production of the non-fiction radio series Last Chance to See, in which he and naturalist Mark Carwardine visited rare species such as the kākāpō and baiji, and the publication of a tie-in book of the same name. In 1992, this was made into a CD-ROM combination of audiobook, e-book and picture slide show.\\nAdams and Mark Carwardine contributed the \\'Meeting a Gorilla\\' passage from Last Chance to See to the book The Great Ape Project.[50] This book, edited by Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer, launched a wider-scale project in 1993, which calls for the extension of moral equality to include all great apes, human and non-human.\\nIn 1994, he participated in a climb of Mount Kilimanjaro while wearing a rhino suit for the British charity organisation Save the Rhino International. Puppeteer William Todd-Jones, who had originally worn the suit in the London Marathon to raise money and bring awareness to the group, also participated in the climb wearing a rhino suit; Adams wore the suit while travelling to the mountain before the climb began. About £100,000 was raised through that event, benefiting schools in Kenya and a black rhinoceros preservation programme in Tanzania. Adams was also an active supporter of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund.\\nSince 2003, Save the Rhino has held an annual Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture around the time of his birthday to raise money for environmental campaigns.[51]\\nAdams bought his first word processor in 1982, having considered one as early as 1979. His first purchase was a Nexu. In 1983, when he and Jane Belson went to Los Angeles, he bought a DEC Rainbow. Upon their return to England, Adams bought an Apricot, then a BBC Micro and a Tandy 1000.[52] In Last Chance to See, Adams mentions his Cambridge Z88, which he had taken to Zaire on a quest to find the northern white rhinoceros.[53]\\nAdams\\'s posthumously published work, The Salmon of Doubt, features several articles by him on the subject of technology, including reprints of articles that originally ran in MacUser, and in The Independent on Sunday. In these, Adams claims that one of the first computers he ever saw was a Commodore PET, and that he had \"adored\" his Apple Macintosh (\"or rather my family of however many Macintoshes it is that I\\'ve recklessly accumulated over the years\") since he first saw one at Infocom\\'s offices in Boston in 1984.[54]\\nAdams was a Macintosh user from the time they first came out in 1984 until his death in 2001. He was the first person to buy a Mac in Europe, the second being Stephen Fry.[55] Adams was also an \"Apple Master\", celebrities whom Apple made into spokespeople for its products (others included John Cleese and Gregory Hines). Adams\\'s contributions included a rock video that he created using the first version of iMovie with footage featuring his daughter Polly. The video was available on Adams\\'s .Mac homepage. Adams installed and started using the first release of Mac OS X in the weeks leading up to his death. His last post to his own forum was in praise of Mac OS X and the possibilities of its Cocoa programming framework. He said it was \"awesome...\", which was also the last word he wrote on his site.[56]\\nAdams used email to correspond with Steve Meretzky in the early 1980s, during their collaboration on Infocom\\'s version of The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy.[52] While living in New Mexico in 1993 he set up another e-mail address and began posting to his own USENET newsgroup, alt.fan.douglas-adams, and occasionally, when his computer was acting up, to the comp.sys.mac hierarchy.[57] Challenges to the authenticity of his messages later led Adams to set up a message forum on his own website to avoid the issue. In 1996, Adams was a keynote speaker at the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference (PDC) where he described the personal computer as being a modelling device. The video of his keynote speech is archived on Channel 9.[58]\\nAdams was also a keynote speaker for the April 2001 Embedded Systems Conference in San Francisco, one of the major technical conferences on embedded system engineering.[59]\\nAdams moved to Upper Street, Islington, in 1981[60] and to Duncan Terrace, a few minutes\\' walk away, in the late 1980s.[60]\\nIn the early 1980s, Adams had an affair with novelist Sally Emerson, who was separated from her husband at that time. Adams later dedicated his book Life, the Universe and Everything to Emerson. In 1981, Emerson returned to her husband, Peter Stothard, a contemporary of Adams at Brentwood School, and later editor of The Times. Adams was soon introduced by friends to Jane Belson, with whom he later became romantically involved. Belson was the \"lady barrister\" mentioned in the jacket-flap biography printed in his books during the mid-1980s (\"He [Adams] lives in Islington with a lady barrister and an Apple Macintosh\"). The two lived in Los Angeles together during 1983, while Adams worked on an early screenplay adaptation of Hitchhiker\\'s. When the deal fell through, they moved back to London, and after several separations (\"He is currently not certain where he lives, or with whom\")[61] and a broken engagement, they married on 25 November 1991.\\nAdams and Belson had one daughter together, Polly Jane Rocket Adams, born on 22 June 1994, shortly after Adams turned 42. In 1999, the family moved from London to Santa Barbara, California, where they lived until his death. Following the funeral, Jane Belson and Polly Adams returned to London.[62] Belson died on 7 September 2011 of cancer, aged 59.[63]\\nAdams died of a heart attack due to undiagnosed coronary artery disease on 11 May 2001, aged 49, after resting from his regular workout at a private gym in Montecito, California.[64] His funeral was held on 16 May in Santa Barbara. His ashes were placed in Highgate Cemetery in north London in June 2002.[65] A memorial service was held on 17 September 2001 at St Martin-in-the-Fields church, Trafalgar Square, London. This became the first church service broadcast live on the web by the BBC.[66]\\nTwo days before Adams died, the Minor Planet Center announced the naming of asteroid 18610\\xa0Arthurdent.[67] In 2005, the asteroid 25924\\xa0Douglasadams was named in his memory.[68]\\nIn May 2002, The Salmon of Doubt was published, containing many short stories, essays, and letters, as well as eulogies from Richard Dawkins, Stephen Fry (in the UK edition), Christopher Cerf (in the US edition), and Terry Jones (in the US paperback edition). It also includes eleven chapters of his unfinished novel, The Salmon of Doubt, which was originally intended to become a new Dirk Gently novel, but might have later become the sixth Hitchhiker novel.[69][70]\\nOther events after Adams\\'s death included a webcast production of Shada, allowing the complete story to be told, radio dramatisations of the final three books in the Hitchhiker\\'s series, and the completion of the film adaptation of The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy. The film, released in 2005, posthumously credits Adams as a producer, and several design elements – including a head-shaped planet seen near the end of the film – incorporated Adams\\'s features.\\nA 12-part radio series based on the Dirk Gently novels was announced in 2007.[71]\\nBBC Radio 4 also commissioned a third Dirk Gently radio series based on the incomplete chapters of The Salmon of Doubt, and written by Kim Fuller;[72] but this was dropped in favour of a BBC TV series based on the two completed novels.[73] A sixth Hitchhiker novel, And Another Thing..., by Artemis Fowl author Eoin Colfer, was released on 12 October 2009 (the 30th anniversary of the first book), published with the support of Adams\\'s estate. A BBC Radio 4 Book at Bedtime adaptation and an audio book soon followed.\\nOn 25 May 2001, two weeks after Adams\\'s death, his fans organised a tribute known as Towel Day, which has been observed every year since then.[74]\\nAn Apple Macintosh SE/30 once owned by Adams can be seen on display at The Centre for Computing History in Cambridge.[75]\\nIn 2018, John Lloyd presented an hour-long episode of the BBC Radio Four documentary Archive on 4, discussing Adams\\' private papers, which are held at St John\\'s College, Cambridge.[76] The episode is available online.[76]\\nTravessa Douglas Adams, a street at 27°35′21.8″S 48°39′44.0″W\\ufeff / \\ufeff27.589389°S 48.662222°W\\ufeff / -27.589389; -48.662222\\ufeff (Travessa Douglas Adams) in São José, Santa Catarina, Brazil is named in Adams\\'s honour.[77]\\nIn March 2021, Unbound announced a crowdfunder for 42: the wildly improbable ideas of Douglas Adams, on the 20th anniversary of his death, a book based on Adams\\'s papers, edited by Kevin Jon Davies.[78]\\nThe annual Douglas Adams Memorial Lectures[79] began in 2003 and continued to 2016.\\nIncludes short stories, essays, and interviews by Adams\\nOpen source, online, comic encyclopaedia \\n1983\\n4 stories with 13 episodes\\n',\n",
       " '\\nMargery Louise Allingham (20 May 1904 – 30 June 1966) was an English novelist from the \"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\", and considered one of its four \"Queens of Crime\", alongside Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers and Ngaio Marsh. \\nAllingham is best remembered for her hero, the gentleman sleuth Albert Campion. Initially believed to be a parody of Dorothy L. Sayers\\'s detective Lord Peter Wimsey, Campion matured into a strongly individual character, part-detective, part-adventurer, who formed the basis for 18 novels and many short stories.\\nMargery Louise Allingham was born on 20 May 1904 in Ealing, London, the eldest daughter of Herbert John (1868-1936) and Emily Jane (née Hughes; 1879-1960). She had a younger brother Philip William, and a younger sister Emily Joyce Allingham, former WRENS member and amateur filmmaker.[1][2] Her family was immersed in literature; her parents were both writers. Her father was editor of the Christian Globe and The New London Journal, to which Margery later contributed articles and Sexton Blake stories, and he had become a successful pulp fiction writer, and her mother, as Emmie Allingham, was a contributor of stories to women\\'s magazines. Soon after Margery\\'s birth the family left London for Essex, where they lived in an old house in Layer Breton, a village near Colchester. She attended a local school and then the Perse School for Girls in Cambridge, all the while writing stories and plays. She earned her first fee at the age of eight, for a story printed in her aunt\\'s magazine.[3]\\nUpon returning to London in 1920 she studied drama and speech training at Regent Street Polytechnic, which helped her manage a stammer which she had  since childhood. At this time she first met her future husband, Philip Youngman Carter, whom she married in 1927. He collaborated with her and designed the jackets for many of her books. They lived on the edge of the Essex Marshes in Tolleshunt D\\'Arcy, near Maldon.[3]\\nWhile she was enrolled at the Regent Street Polytechnic she wrote a verse play, Dido and Aeneas, which was performed at St. George\\'s Hall, London, and the Cripplegate Theatre, London. Allingham played the role of Dido and the scenery was designed by Philip Youngman Carter.[4]\\nHer first novel, Blackkerchief Dick, was published in 1923, when she was 19. It was allegedly based on a story she had heard during a séance, though later in life this was debunked by her husband. Nevertheless, Allingham continued to include occult themes in many of her novels. Blackkerchief Dick was well received, but was not a financial success. She wrote several plays in this period and attempted to write a serious novel, but finding that her themes clashed with her natural light-heartedness, she decided instead to try the mystery genre.\\nHer breakthrough occurred in 1929 with the publication of The Crime at Black Dudley. This introduced Albert Campion, initially as a minor character, thought to be a parody of Dorothy Sayers’s Lord Peter Wimsey.[5] Campion returned in Mystery Mile, thanks in part to pressure from her American publishers, who had been taken with the character.\\nWith a strong central character and a format to work in, she began to produce a series of Campion novels. At first she also continued writing short stories and articles for magazines such as The Strand Magazine, but as her Campion saga went on her sales grew steadily. Campion proved so successful that Allingham made him the centrepiece of another 17 novels and more than 20 short stories, continuing into the 1960s.[citation needed]\\nCampion is a mysterious upper-class character (early novels hint that his family is in the line of succession to the throne), working under an assumed name. He floats between the upper echelons of the nobility and government on the one hand, and the shady world of the criminal class on the other, often accompanied by his scurrilous ex-burglar servant Magersfontein Lugg. During the course of his career Campion is sometimes a detective, sometimes an adventurer.\\nThe first three Campion novels, The Crime at Black Dudley, Mystery Mile and Look to the Lady, were all written by what Allingham referred to as the \"plum pudding\" method, focused less on methods of murder or the formal strictures of the whodunit and more on mixing possibilities together.[6] As the series progresses, however, Campion comes to work more closely with the police and MI6 counter-intelligence.[7] He also falls in love, gets married and has a child, and as time goes by he grows in wisdom and matures emotionally.\\nThe style and format of the books moved on: while the early novels are light-hearted whodunnits or \"fantastical\" adventures,[7] The Tiger in the Smoke (1952) is more a character study than a crime novel, focusing on the serial killer Jack Havoc. In many of the later books Campion plays a subsidiary role, no more prominent than the roles of his wife Amanda and his police associates, and in the last novel he is a minor character.\\nIn 1941 Allingham published a non-fiction work, The Oaken Heart, which describes her experiences in Essex when an invasion from Germany was expected and actively being planned for, potentially placing the civilian population of Essex in the front line.[8]\\nAllingham suffered from breast cancer and died at Severalls Hospital, Colchester, England, on 30 June 1966, aged 62. Her final Campion novel, Cargo of Eagles, was completed by her husband at her request, and was published in 1968. She was cared for through her illness by her sister, who avoided the topic in her films depicting their home life as well as ensuring her husband was not inconvenienced by it.[9]\\nCompilations of her work, both with and without Albert Campion, continued to be released through the 1970s. The Margery Allingham Omnibus, comprising Sweet Danger, The Case of the Late Pig and The Tiger in the Smoke, with a critical introduction by Jane Stevenson, was published in 2006.[10]\\nAllingham was buried in the newer cemetery in Tolleshunt D\\'Arcy, which is across the road from the graveyard of St Nicholas\\'s Church and about half a mile to the south.\\nA film version of Tiger in the Smoke was made in 1956 and a highly popular series of Campion adaptations, now available on DVD, was shown by the BBC in 1989–90. It is titled simply Campion and stars Peter Davison as Campion and Brian Glover as Lugg.[11]\\nSeveral books have been written about Allingham and her work, including:\\nFurther Campion adventures have been written by Mike Ripley. The first of these, Mr Campion\\'s Farewell, was based on notes left at his death by Allingham\\'s husband Philip Youngman Carter; all the rest have been originals.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nRudolfo Anaya (October 30, 1937\\xa0– June 28, 2020) was an American author. Noted for his 1972 novel Bless Me, Ultima, Anaya was considered one of the founders of the canon of contemporary Chicano and New Mexican literature.[1][2]  The themes and cultural references of the novel, which were uncommon at the time of its publication, had a lasting impression on fellow Latino writers.   It was subsequently adapted into a film and an opera.\\nRudolfo Anaya was raised in Santa Rosa, New Mexico. His father, Martín Anaya, was a vaquero from a family of cattle workers and sheepherders. His mother, Rafaelita (Mares), was from a family composed of farmers from Puerto De Luna in the Pecos Valley of New Mexico.[3] Anaya grew up with two half-brothers, from his mother\\'s previous marriage, and four sisters. The beauty of the desert flatlands of New Mexico, referenced as the llano in Anaya\\'s writings, had a profound influence on his early childhood.[4]\\nAnaya\\'s family relocated from rural New Mexico to Albuquerque in 1952, when he was in the eighth grade.[5] He attended Albuquerque High School, graduating in 1956.[4] This experience later appeared as an autobiographical allusion in his novel Tortuga.[3] When he was 16 he sustained a spinal cord injury which left him temporarily paralyzed.[6] Following high school, he earned a B.A. in English and American Literature from the University of New Mexico in 1963. He went on to complete two master\\'s degrees at the University of New Mexico, one in 1968 for English and another in 1972 for guidance and counseling.[3] While earning his master\\'s degrees, Anaya worked as a high school English teacher in the Albuquerque public schools from 1963 until 1968.[4][7] In 1966, he married Patricia Lawless, who continued to support his writing.[3]\\nHe began writing his best-known work Bless Me, Ultima in 1963, with the manuscript completed and published by Quinto Sol in 1972.[3] Initially, Anaya faced tremendous difficulty getting his work published by mainstream publishing houses because of its unique combination of English and Spanish language, as well as its Chicano-centric content.[8] Independent publishing house Quinto Sol quickly published the book after awarding it the Premio Quinto Sol in 1971 for best novel written by a Chicano.[3] The book went on to sell over 300,000 copies in 21 printings.[9]  The themes and cultural references touched on in the novel were uncommon at the time of its publication.  Consequently, it ended up having a lasting impact on a generation of Latino writers.[10]\\nFollowing the book\\'s success, Anaya was invited to join the English faculty at the University of New Mexico in 1975, where he taught until his retirement in 1993.[8]\\nAnaya traveled extensively through both China in 1984, and South America following his retirement. His experiences in China are chronicled in his travel journal, A Chicano in China, published in 1986.[3][4]\\nDuring the 1990s, Anaya found an even wider audience as mainstream publishing house Warner books signed him on for a six-book deal beginning with the novel Alburquerque. He subsequently created the Sonny Baca mystery series which included Zia Summer, Rio Grande Fall, Jalamanta: A Message from the Desert, and Shaman Winter. The Anaya Reader, a collection of his works, followed.[4][9][11]\\nBless Me, Ultima was released as a feature film on February 22, 2013.[12] It was subsequently adapted into an opera three years later.[13] Anaya also published a number of books for children and young adults. His first children\\'s book was The Farolitos of Christmas, published in 1995.[4]\\nAnaya\\'s non-fiction work has appeared in many anthologies. In 2015, 52 of his collected essays exploring identity, literature, immigration, and politics were published as The Essays with Open Road Media.[14] In summarizing his career, Anaya stated \"What I’ve wanted to do is compose the Chicano worldview—the synthesis that shows our true mestizo identity—and clarify it for my community and for myself.\"[15]\\nAnaya lived in Albuquerque, where each day he spent several hours writing.[4][16] He died at his home on June 28, 2020, at the age of 82.[17][18]  He had been suffering from a long illness in the time leading up to his death.[10]\\nThe occult detective fiction series following the titular character Sonny Baca.\\nSource:[22]\\n',\n",

Atkins wore number 99 for the Tigers.[citation needed]\\nAtkins graduated from Auburn University in 1994.[4]\\nAtkins worked[when?] as a crime reporter in the newsroom of The Tampa Tribune before he published his first novel, Crossroad Blues (1998).[citation needed] While at the Tribune, Atkins earned a Pulitzer Prize nomination for a feature series based on his investigation into a forgotten murder of the 1950s.[5] The story became the core of his critically acclaimed novel, White Shadow, which was commented on positively by noted authors and critics. In his next novels, Wicked City and Devil\\'s Garden, Atkins continued this kind of story-telling, a style that was compared to that of Dennis Lehane and George Pelecanos.[5]\\nWhite Shadow (2006), Wicked City (2008), and Devil\\'s Garden (2009) are personal books for Atkins, all set in his former homes: San Francisco, where he lived as a child; Alabama, his family\\'s home and where he was born and went to college; and Tampa, where he embarked on his career as a writer. Each novel contains bits of himself – friends and colleagues he once knew, people he respected or admired, family members, and personal heroes.\\nIn Devil\\'s Garden, Atkins explores the early life of one of those heroes: Dashiell Hammett, the originator of the hard-boiled crime novel. As a Pinkerton Agency detective, Hammett investigated the rape and manslaughter case against early Hollywood star Roscoe Arbuckle, one of the most sensational trials of the 20th Century.[5]  Atkins\\' novel Infamous (2010) is based on the 1933 Charles Urschel kidnapping and subsequent misadventures of the gangster couple George \"Machine Gun\" and Kathryn Kelly.[citation needed]\\nIn 2011, Atkins was selected by the estate of Robert B. Parker to take over writing the Spenser series of novels.[6] The Boston Globe wrote that while some people might have \"viewed the move as unseemly, those people didn\\'t know Robert B. Parker, a man who, when asked how his books would be viewed in 50 years, replied: \\'Don\\'t know, don\\'t care.\\' He was proud of his work, but he mainly saw writing as a means of providing a comfortable life for his family.\"[7]\\nIn a 2023 interview for CrimeReads,\\nAtkins said he’s been living for the past twenty years on a historic farm outside Oxford, Mississippi with his family.[4][8]\\n',\n",

She lived in New York City and Minneapolis and had a brief early marriage before moving to Clinton, Mississippi, to work as a Park Ranger and where she married her second husband.[2]\\nWhen Barr\\'s first husband changed careers from being a theatre director and became interested in the environmental movement, she began working as a seasonal park ranger in the summer at several National Parks. Her first permanent park ranger job was on the Natchez Trace Parkway in Mississippi. Barr began writing in earnest in 1978, when she was 26.[2] Her first book was historical, titled Bittersweet was published in 1984. Her first mystery novel Track of the Cat was published in 1993. This won two awards as a first novel.\\nThat first novel featured the character of Anna Pigeon, which character she conceived while working at her second seasonal job in Guadalupe Mountains National Park in Texas. Pigeon is a law enforcement ranger with the United States National Park Service. The first mystery novel became first in a series. The books in the series take place in various national parks (and other protected areas) where Pigeon solves murders that are often related to natural resource issues.

He attended law school at the University of Mississippi in 1939 but left in 1942 to join the United States Army Air Forces,[1] eventually earning the rank of captain.[citation needed] While stationed in Greenwood, Mississippi for pilot training, he met and befriended Mickey Spillane, who was then in Greenwood serving in the Army.[2] He married Mary Johanna Poehlmann in 1945.[3] After the war, he moved briefly to Brooklyn, New York, where he worked with Spillane. In 1946, apparently during his time with Spillane in New York, Basinsky published two short stories in comic books: \"Killer\\'s Choice\" in Vic Verity,[4] and \"Knife Act\" in Don Fortune Magazine.[5] He returned to Vicksburg and worked at his father\\'s printing shop, but was encouraged to return to writing when Spillane visited in 1953.[6]\\nLike Charlie Wells and David A. Gerrity, Basinsky benefitted from Spillane\\'s friendship and advice as a more seasoned author,[7] as well as a connection to publishers.[8] As he did with several other young writers,[9] Spillane supported Basinsky\\'s work with encouragement and cover blurbs praising Basinsky on his novels. Spillane also put in a good word to Basinsky\\'s future publisher E.P. Dutton, writing that \"This is my buddy \\'s book. He was there when I, the Jury was written.\"[10]\\nBasinsky\\'s first novel was 1955\\'s The Big Steal, about a policeman who spirals down a dark path after being falsely accused of stealing ransom money. After losing both his job and his wife, he tracks down the real villain and gets violent revenge.[6] A 1955 review of The Big Steal in Saturday Review called it an \"incredible windup.\"[11] The Big Steal was translated into French and published by the Serie Noire imprint as Le Magot.[12]\\nIn 1956, his second novel, Death Is a Cold, Keen Edge, was released. It follows a psychopathic World War II veteran on a murder spree.[6]\\nThe original cover illustrations of Basinsky\\'s novels, done by artist Robert Maguire, have been called some of \"the most evocative and memorable of the period\" by Lee Server, author of the Encyclopedia of Pulp Fiction Writers.[13]\\nCritical appraisals of Basinsky\\'s books ranged from positive to unenthusiastic. Critic Bill Pronzini, in 1001 Midnights: The Aficionado\\'s Guide To Mystery and Detective Fiction, called Basinsky\\'s novels \"vivid (and) idiosyncratic.\"[14] In Pronzini\\'s later book Gun in Cheek: An Affectionate Guide to the \"Worst\" in Mystery Fiction, he said that Basinsky was better than his fellow Spillane protégés in that he shared his mentor\\'s \"knack for raw and stomach-churning violence,\" but that his writing was also cliche-ridden and narratively clumsy, with \"a shameless desire to wax poetic every now and then.\"[7] Anthony Boucher, writing in the June 26, 1955 New York Times Book Review, noted that The Big Steal\\'s dedication read \"For Mickey Spillane, who insisted, and for Nathan Jr., who suffered,\" and, instead of reviewing the book, simply stated that \"personally, I\\'m on Nathan Jr.\\'s side.\"[7]\\nBasinsky also published three short stories in crime-fiction pulp magazines in 1957 and 1958. Critic Peter Enfantino, writing about them for Mystery File: The Crime Fiction Research Journal, said that they were \"all short and unremarkable, flawed by outlandish premises and silly expositories.\"[15]\\nBasinsky died on March 12, 1963, in Vicksburg.[1]\\nNovels\\nShort Stories\\n',\n",

Moore, one of the first two women ever nominated for a Hugo Award. In 2020, she posthumously won a Retro Hugo for her novel The Nemesis From Terra, originally published as Shadow Over Mars (Startling Stories, Fall 1944).\\nLeigh Brackett was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Her father died when she was very young; her mother did not remarry. She was a tomboy, \"tall\" and \"athletic\".[1] She attended a private girls\\' school in Santa Monica, California, where she was involved in theater and began writing.[1]\\nBrackett first published in her mid-20s; the science fiction story \"Martian Quest\" appeared in the February 1940 issue of Astounding Science Fiction.[2] Her earliest years as a writer (1940–1942) were her most productive. Some of her stories have social themes, such as \"The Citadel of Lost Ships\" (1943), which considers the effects on alien cultures of Earth\\'s expanding trade empire. At the time, she was an active member of the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society (LASFS), and participated in local science fiction fandom by contributing to the second issue of Pogo\\'s STF-ETTE, an all-female science fiction fanzine (probably the first such).[3]\\nBrackett\\'s first novel, No Good from a Corpse (1944),[2] was a hard-boiled mystery novel in the tradition of Raymond Chandler. The book led to her first big screenwriting assignment. After this, Brackett\\'s science fiction stories became more ambitious. Shadow Over Mars (1944) was her first novel-length story; though rough-edged, it marked the beginning of a new style influenced by the characterization of the 1940s detective story and film noir.[4] It won a Retro Hugo for best novel in 2020.\\nPlanet Stories published the novella \"Lorelei of the Red Mist\", in which the protagonist is a thief named Hugh Starke. Brackett finished the first half before turning it over to her close friend[5] Bradbury, so that she could leave to work on the screenplay of The Big Sleep.\\nBrackett returned to science fiction writing in 1948 after her movie work. Between 1948 and 1951, she produced a series of science fiction adventure stories that were longer than her previous work, including classic representations of her planetary settings as \"The Moon that Vanished\" and the novel Sea-Kings of Mars (1949). The latter was later published as The Sword of Rhiannon.\\nIn \"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\" (1949), Brackett created the character of Eric John Stark.[2] Stark, an orphan from Earth, is raised by the semi-sentient aboriginals of Mercury, who are later killed by Earthmen.[2] He is saved by a Terran official, who adopts and mentors Stark. When threatened, Stark reverts to the primitive N\\'Chaka, the \"man without a tribe\", who he was on Mercury. From 1949 to 1951, Brackett featured Stark (whose name echoes that of the hero in \"Lorelei of the Red Mist\") in three stories published in Planet Stories: \"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\", \"Enchantress of Venus\", and \"Black Amazon of Mars\". With this last story, Brackett\\'s high adventure period ended.\\nBrackett adopted an elegiac tone in her stories, no longer celebrating the conflicts of frontier worlds but lamenting the passing of civilizations, and concentrating more on mood than plot.[citation needed] The stories\\' reflective, introspective nature is indicated in the titles: \"The Last Days of Shandakor\", \"Shannach—the Last\", and \"Last Call from Sector 9G\".\\n\"Last Call\" was published in the final issue (Summer 1955) of Planet Stories, which had been her most reliable publisher. After Planet Stories folded, and then Startling Stories and Thrilling Wonder Stories, Brackett lost her magazine market. The first phase of her career as a science fiction author ended. She produced other stories over the next decade, and revised and published some as novels. A new production of this period was The Long Tomorrow (1955), one of Brackett\\'s more critically acclaimed novels. It describes an agrarian, technophobic society that develops after a nuclear war.\\nAfter 1955, Brackett concentrated on writing for the more lucrative film and television markets. In 1963 and 1964, she briefly returned to her old Martian milieu with a pair of stories. \"The Road to Sinharat\" was an affectionate farewell to the world of \"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\", and the other, with the intentionally ridiculous title of \"Purple Priestess of the Mad Moon\", borders on parody.[citation needed]\\nBrackett and her husband shared Guest of Honor duties at the 22nd World Science Fiction Convention in 1965 in Oakland, California.[6]\\nAfter another decade-long hiatus, Brackett returned to science fiction in the 1970s with the publication of The Ginger Star (1974), The Hounds of Skaith (1974), and The Reavers of Skaith (1976), collected as The Book of Skaith in 1976. This trilogy brought Eric John Stark back for adventures on the extra-solar planet of Skaith (rather than his old haunts, Mars and Venus).\\nOften called the \"Queen of Space Opera\", Brackett also wrote planetary romance. Almost all her planetary romances take place in the Leigh Brackett solar system, which contains richly detailed fictional versions of the consensus Mars and Venus of science fiction from the 1930s to the 1950s. Mars appears as a marginally habitable desert world, populated by ancient, decadent and mostly humanoid races, and Venus as a primitive, wet jungle planet, occupied by vigorous, primitive tribes and reptilian monsters. Brackett\\'s Skaith combines elements of her other worlds with fantasy elements.[citation needed]\\nThough Edgar Rice Burroughs\\'s influence is apparent in Brackett\\'s Mars stories,[7] her Mars is set firmly in a world of interplanetary commerce and competition. A prominent theme of her stories is the clash of planetary civilizations; they illustrate and criticize the effects of colonialism on civilizations that are either older or younger than those of the colonizers. Burroughs\\'s heroes set out to remake entire worlds according to their own codes; Brackett\\'s heroes (often antiheroes) are at the mercy of trends and movements far bigger than they are.[8]\\nAfter the Mariner missions indicated there was no life on Mars, Brackett never returned to her solar system. When she started to write planetary romance again in the 1970s, she invented a new solar system outside our own.[2]\\nShortly after Brackett broke into science fiction writing, she wrote her first screenplays. Hollywood director Howard Hawks was so impressed by her novel No Good from a Corpse that he had his secretary call in \"this guy Brackett\" to help William Faulkner write the script for The Big Sleep (1946).[9] The film was written by Brackett, Faulkner, and Jules Furthman, and starred Humphrey Bogart.\\nAfter getting married, Brackett took a break from screenwriting. When she returned to screenwriting in the mid-1950s, she wrote for TV and movies. Howard Hawks hired her to write or co-write several John Wayne pictures, including Rio Bravo (1959), Hatari! (1962), El Dorado (1966), and Rio Lobo (1970). Because of her background with The Big Sleep, she later adapted Raymond Chandler\\'s novel The Long Goodbye for the screen.[1]\\nBrackett worked on the screenplay for The Empire Strikes Back, the first Star Wars sequel. The film won the Hugo Award in 1981. This script was a departure for Brackett; until then, all her science fiction had been in the form of novels and short stories. George Lucas said that he asked Brackett to write the screenplay based on his story outline. Brackett wrote a finished first draft, titled \"Star Wars sequel\", that was delivered to Lucas shortly before her death from cancer on March 18, 1978, but her version was rejected and Lucas wrote two drafts of a new screenplay and, following the delivery of the screenplay for Raiders of the Lost Ark, turned them over to Lawrence Kasdan to rework some dialogue.[10][11] Brackett and Kasdan (but not Lucas) were credited for the final screenplay. Brackett was credited in tribute despite not being involved in the final film.\\nLaurent Bouzereau, in Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays, said that Lucas disliked the direction of Brackett\\'s screenplay, discarded it, and produced two more screenplays before turning the results over to Kasdan.[12] io9\\'s co-founder Charlie Jane Anders has written that while \"It\\'s fashionable to disparage Brackett\\'s contributions to Empire\", \"it\\'s not true that none of Brackett\\'s storyline winds up in the final movie—the basic story beats are the same.\"[13]\\nFor over 30 years, Brackett\\'s screenplay could be read only at the Jack Williamson Special Collections library at Eastern New Mexico University in Portales, New Mexico, and at Lucasfilm\\'s archives in California. It was officially published in February 2016.[14] In this draft, there is a love triangle between Luke, Leia and Han Solo. Yoda is named Minch, Luke has a hidden sister named Nellith, Lando Calrissian is Lando Kaddar, Luke\\'s father is still a distinct character from Darth Vader and appears as a Force ghost on Dagobah, and Han Solo, at the end of the script, leaves to search for his uncle Ovan Marek, the most powerful man in the universe after the Emperor Palpatine.\\nJohn Saavedra of Den of Geek website wrote:\\nMost importantly, you see that Brackett\\'s draft, while definitely in need of a rewrite and several tweaks, holds all of the big moments we\\'d eventually see on screen. We still get a version of the Battle of Hoth (a much more ridiculous one), the wise words of an old Jedi Master, the excitement of zooming through a deadly asteroid field, a love triangle (a MUCH more overt one), a majestic city in the clouds, unexpected betrayals, and the climactic duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader that we would reenact on playgrounds for years to come.[15]On December 31, 1946, at age 31, Brackett married another science fiction writer, Edmond Hamilton,[2] in San Gabriel, California. Fellow LASFS member Ray Bradbury served as best man.[1][2] Bradbury and Robert Heinlein were longtime close friends of Brackett\\'s.[1] She moved with Hamilton to Kinsman, Ohio.\\nEdmond Hamilton died in February 1977 in Lancaster, California, of complications following kidney surgery. Brackett died there in March 1978, of cancer, at age 62.[15][16]\\n',\n",

His later career moved from journalism to broadcasting, and he participated in Any Questions and The Brains Trust for BBC Radio.\\nBorn William Collin Brooks he was the son of William Edward Brooks (1864–1914) and Isabella (née Thomas), herself the daughter of Griffith Thomas and Isabella (née Harrison – a descendant of Colonel Thomas Harrison of Cromwell\\'s New Model Army).  He was born and brought up in the north of England, spent only seven years in formal education, and after a short period as a trainee accountant became a commercial traveller for various companies, from the age of fifteen to twenty.\\nIn 1913 he founded the Manchester Press Agency. Brooks\\' father died only weeks before the outbreak of World War I, and his mother Isabella died eighteen months later, on Christmas Eve 1915. Two weeks later their son married Lillian Susanna Marsden, and the couple had five children:  Barbara (who died in infancy); Rosemary Collin Brooks (1920–1971), whose career included a period working for MI5; Vivian Collin Brooks (1922–2003) – a journalist who wrote a number of detective books under the pen-name \"Osmington Mills\"; William Austen Brooks (1924–1986), also a journalist: and Edward Clarke Brooks (1928–2010) who became an actor and wrote a number of short stories.\\nOn 20 November 1915, Collin Brooks joined the British Army, and after a period driving tanks transferred to the machine gun corps. As a 2nd Lieutenant, he was awarded the Military Cross, his citation reading:  “For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during the attack across the Piave on 27 October 1918. This officer led his four guns forward under heavy shell and machine gun fire with the forward waves of the infantry.  On arrival at the objective, by his skilful handling of his guns, he formed a defensive flank and in spite of heavy casualties he maintained his position. The coolness and energy of this officer was, throughout the action, a fine example to the men under him.”\\nHis own field notes — taken from his pocket book — of this event run as follows:\\nHis war service was followed by an increased awareness and involvement in politics and journalism. In 1921 he was employed by the Liverpool Courier; in 1923 he joined the Yorkshire Post, and moved in 1928 to their London office. This was followed by a move to the position of editor of the Financial News later that year.[1] In 1933 he moved to the Sunday Dispatch, which began his long involvement with Harold Sidney Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere. He was shortly elevated to the position of Editor of the Sunday Dispatch.[2]\\nWith his work for Rothermere, the family spent time living both in London and also in Norfolk – in a house called \"The Mount\" on Rothermere\\'s Stody estate; the relationship between Brooks and Rothermere was sufficiently close that he was named as literary legatee in Rothermere\\'s will.[3]\\nHe later worked on a number of other papers, being from 1941 to 1953 chairman and Editor of Truth, an exposé magazine of political and society issues,[4][5] and wrote the magazine\\'s \"Letter to America\" on a regular basis. He joined the Daily Express Group in 1953 and continued at the same time as chairman and leader writer of The Statist.[1] He was also a ghost-writer for a number of people, and many political speeches and white papers were influenced to some extent by him.\\nHe was a member of a number of clubs, including the Savage Club, and the book \"Brother Savages and Guests\" by Percy V.

The Cat Who books features newspaper journalist Jim Qwilleran and his two Siamese cats, Koko (short for Kao K\\'o Kung) and Yum Yum, first in an unnamed midwestern American city and then in the fictitious small town of Pickax located in Moose County \"400 miles north of everywhere\". Although never explicitly located in the books, the towns, counties, and lifestyles portrayed in the series are generally accepted to be modeled after Bad Axe, Michigan, where Braun resided with her husband until the mid-1980s.\\nBorn Lilian Jackson in the Willimansett neighborhood of Chicopee, Massachusetts, to Charles and Clara Ward Jackson,[2] she began her writing career as a teenager, contributing sports poetry to the Detroit News. She went on to write advertising copy for many Detroit department stores. At the Detroit Free Press she worked 30 years as the \"Good Living\" editor and retired in 1978.\\nBraun wrote a series of three mystery novels published to critical acclaim from 1966 to 1968: The Cat Who Could Read Backwards, The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern, and The Cat Who Turned On and Off. In 1986 the Berkley Publishing Group continued the series, and introduced Braun to a new generation, by publishing The Cat Who Saw Red as a paperback original. During the next two years, Berkley released four more Cat Who novels in paperback and reprinted all three from the 1960s. The series rose to the top of some bestseller lists; it reached number two on the New York Times Best Seller list with its 23rd volume The Cat Who Smelled a Rat in 2001. The 29th and last completed novel in the series, The Cat Who Had 60 Whiskers was published by Penguin Group in January 2007. Like many writers of her generation, Braun was an admitted technophobe; she wrote all of her books in long hand and then typed them herself.\\nLittle was known about Braun, who was protective of her private life.

His most recent novel in this series, The Bangkok Asset, was published on 4 August 2015.\\nBurdett was born in London, England, the son of a London policeman.[1] Burdett is a former lawyer who practised in Hong Kong. As of 2007, he split his time between southwestern France and Bangkok.[1]\\nSet in Hong Kong in April and May 1997, just before the British turnover of the territory to mainland China, this novel deals with a horrific murder investigation.  Three severed heads are found in a floating garbage bag on the maritime border between Hong Kong territory and China. They match the three DNA profiles found in a vat of minced human meat that had been abandoned in a warehouse.  Political implications of the crime may complicate the turnover, and political pressure is brought both to halt the investigation and to hurry it.  The detective, a half-Chinese half-Irish Hong Kong resident, finds himself threatened by both sides—all the more so when a WMD smuggling plot that threatens to force outright war between Britain and China is uncovered.\\nThe Sonchai Jitpleecheep series of crime novels is mainly set in Bangkok and consists of six books: Bangkok 8, Bangkok Tattoo, Bangkok Haunts, The Godfather of Kathmandu, Vulture Peak, and The Bangkok Asset. They centre on the philosophical Thai Buddhist detective, Sonchai Jitpleecheep, and his meditative internal dialogues. Sonchai is a \"leuk krung\" or half-caste. He is the son of a former \"rented-wife\" (a type of prostitute) and a \"farang\". His father was a U.S. military officer whom he never knew. Sonchai has spent much of his childhood in Europe and the U.S.. A born \"outsider\", he is also seemingly unbribeable, which increases his alienation from his colleagues.\\nThe novels involve Thailand\\'s sex industry and the red-light districts of Bangkok. Sexual matters are part of the narrative, including the juxtaposition of often conflicting Thai and Western norms and mores. They have been widely praised for the breadth and depth of understanding of a number of different cultures. Apart from the Anglo-Saxon cultural traditions with which he was brought up, Burdett has shown considerable familiarity with Confucian, Buddhist, Latin and North African societies, due to his extensive travels.\\nThe novels contain larger-than-life characters intertwined with a wry sense of humour and bizarre crimes. The crimes include execution by the release of a container full of cobra snakes into a car where the driver is forcibly prevented from escaping (Bangkok 8), the theft of valuable tattoos (and their associated human skin) off the backs\\' of murder victims (Bangkok Tattoo), and homicide related to the production of a snuff video (Bangkok Haunts). Juxtaposed is the investigative nonchalance and Buddhist acceptance of an \"arhat\" detective who can meditate even in a Bangkok traffic jam. Many popular shamanistic superstitions that have carried over into Buddhism in Thailand are explored. Past lives (reincarnation) and hungry ghosts also contribute to the atmosphere and texture.\\nAll of Burdett\\'s published books have been optioned for films, but due to the exotic location and multi-racial characters, film makers have found it difficult to find appropriate \\'stars\\' and screenplays. Bangkok 8 was optioned by Millennium Films, which produced the fourth movie in the Rambo series in Thailand, and is serious about making the film according to Burdett.[2] Producer John Thompson scouted locations in Bangkok, and James McTeigue, the director of V for Vendetta, had been hired to direct, but production looks to have been cancelled.[3][4]\\n',\n",

       " 'John Dickson Carr (November 30, 1906 – February 27, 1977) was an American author of detective stories, who also published using the pseudonyms Carter Dickson, Carr Dickson, and Roger Fairbairn.\\nHe lived in England for a number of years, and is often grouped among \"British-style\" mystery writers. Most (though not all) of his novels had English settings, especially country villages and estates, and English characters. His two best-known fictional detectives (Dr. Gideon Fell and Sir Henry Merrivale) were both English.\\nCarr is generally regarded as one of the greatest writers of so-called \"Golden Age\" mysteries; complex, plot-driven stories in which the puzzle is paramount. He was influenced in this regard by the works of Gaston Leroux and by the Father Brown stories of G. K. Chesterton. He was a master of the so-called locked room mystery, in which a detective solves apparently impossible crimes. The Dr. Fell mystery The Hollow Man (1935), usually considered Carr\\'s masterpiece, was selected in 1981 as the best locked-room mystery of all time by a panel of 17 mystery authors and reviewers.[1] He also wrote a number of historical mysteries.\\nThe son of Wooda Nicholas Carr, a U.S. congressman from Pennsylvania, Carr graduated from The Hill School in Pottstown in 1925 and Haverford College in 1929. During the early 1930s, he moved to England, where he married Clarice Cleaves, an Englishwoman. He began his mystery-writing career there, returning to the United States as an internationally known author in 1948.\\nIn 1950, his biography of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle earned Carr the first of his two Special Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America; the second was awarded in 1970, in recognition of his 40-year career as a mystery writer.  He was also presented the MWA\\'s Grand Master award in 1963.  Carr was one of only two Americans ever admitted to the British Detection Club.\\nIn early spring 1963, while living in Mamaroneck, New York, Carr suffered a stroke, which paralyzed his left side. He continued to write using one hand, and for several years contributed a regular column of mystery and detective book reviews, \"The Jury Box\", to Ellery Queen\\'s Mystery Magazine. Carr eventually relocated to Greenville, South Carolina, and died there of lung cancer on February 28, 1977.[2]\\n\"Mr. Carr can lead us away from the small, artificial, brightly-lit stage of the ordinary detective plot into the menace of outer darkness. He can create atmosphere with an adjective, alarm with an allusion, or delight with a rollicking absurdity. In short he can write\" -\\nDorothy L. Sayers\\nCarr\\'s two major detective characters, Dr. Fell and Sir Henry Merrivale, are superficially quite similar.  Both are large, upper-class, eccentric Englishmen somewhere between middle-aged and elderly.  Dr. Fell, who is fat and walks only with the aid of two canes, was clearly modeled on the British writer G. K. Chesterton and is at all times civil and genial.  He has a great mass of untidy hair that is often covered by a \"shovel hat\" and he generally wears a cape.  He lives in a modest cottage and does not have any official association with public authorities.\\nHenry Merrivale or \"H.M.\", on the other hand, although stout and with a majestic \"corporation\", is active physically and is feared for his ill-temper and noisy rages.  In a 1949 novel, A Graveyard To Let, for example, he demonstrates an unexpected talent for hitting baseballs improbable distances.  A wealthy descendant of the \"oldest baronetcy\" in England, he is part of the Establishment (even though he frequently rails against it) and in the earlier novels is the director of the British Secret Service.  In The Plague Court Murders he is said to be qualified as both a barrister and a medical doctor.  Even in the earliest books the bald, bespectacled, and scowling H.M. is clearly a Churchillian figure and in the later novels this similarity is somewhat more consciously evoked.  Many of the Merrivale novels, written using the Carter Dickson byline, rank with Carr\\'s best work, including the much-praised The Judas Window (1938).\\nMany of the Fell novels feature two or more different impossible crimes, including He Who Whispers (1946) and The Case of the Constant Suicides (1941).  The novel The Crooked Hinge (1938) combines a seemingly impossible throat-slashing, witchcraft, a survivor of the ship Titanic, an eerie automaton modeled on Wolfgang von Kempelen\\'s chess player, and a case similar to that of the Tichborne Claimant into what is often cited as one of the greatest classics of detective fiction.  But even Carr\\'s biographer, Douglas G. Greene,[3] notes that the explanation, like many of Carr\\'s in other books, seriously stretches plausibility and the reader\\'s credulity.\\nDr. Fell\\'s own discourse on locked room mysteries in chapter 17 of The Hollow Man is acclaimed critically and is sometimes printed as a stand-alone essay in its own right.\\nBesides Dr. Fell and Sir Henry Merrivale, Carr mysteries feature two other series detectives: Henri Bencolin and Colonel March.\\nA few of his novels do not feature a series detective.  The most famous of these, The Burning Court (1937), involves witchcraft, poisoning, and a body that disappears from a sealed crypt in suburban Philadelphia; it was the basis for the French movie La chambre ardente (1962).\\nCarr wrote in the short story format as well.  Julian Symons, in Bloody Murder: From the Detective Story to the Crime Novel: A History (1972), said: \"Most of Carr\\'s stories are compressed versions of his locked-room novels, and at times they benefit from the compression.  Probably the best of them are in the Carter Dickson book, The Department of Queer Complaints (1940), although this does not include the brilliantly clever H.M. story The House in Goblin Wood or a successful pastiche which introduces Edgar Allan Poe as a detective.\"[4]\\nDuring 1950, Carr wrote the novel, The Bride of Newgate, set during 1815 at the close of the Napoleonic Wars, \"one of the earliest historical mystery novels.\"[5] The Devil in Velvet and Fire, Burn! are the two historical novels (involving also Time travel) with which he said he himself was most pleased. With Adrian Conan Doyle, the youngest son of Arthur Conan Doyle, Carr wrote Sherlock Holmes stories that were published in the 1954 collection The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes.  He was also honored by the estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle by being asked to write the biography for the legendary author. The book, The Life of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, was published during 1949 and received generally favorable reviews for its vigor and entertaining style.\\nDr. Fell has generally been considered to be Carr\\'s major creation.  The British novelist Kingsley Amis, for instance, writes in his essay, \"My Favorite Sleuths\", that Dr. Fell is one of the three great successors to Sherlock Holmes (the other two are Father Brown and Nero Wolfe) and that H.M., \"according to me is an old bore.\"  This may be in part because in the Merrivale novels written after World War II, H.M. frequently became a comic caricature of himself, especially in the physical misadventures in which he found himself at least once in every novel.  Humorous as these episodes were intended to be, they also tended to have the effect of decreasing the mystique of the character.  Earlier, however, H.M. had been regarded more favorably by a number of critics. Howard Haycraft, author of the seminal Murder for Pleasure: The Life and Times of the Detective Story, wrote during 1941 that H.M. or \"The Old Man\" was \"the present writer\\'s admitted favorite among contemporary fictional sleuths\".  During 1938 the British mystery writer R. Philmore wrote in an article called \"Inquest on Detective Stories\" that Sir Henry was \"the most amusing of detectives\".  And further: \"Of course, H.M. is so much the best detective that, once having invented him, his creator could get away with any plot.\"\\nThere is a book-length critical study by S. T. Joshi, John Dickson Carr: A Critical Study (1990) (ISBN\\xa00-87972-477-3) and a chapter on Carr in Joshi\\'s book Varieties of Crime Fiction (2019) ISBN\\xa0978-1-4794-4546-2.\\nThe definitive biography of Carr is by Douglas G. Greene, John Dickson Carr: The Man Who Explained Miracles (1995) (ISBN\\xa01-883402-47-6).  From an obituary published in Greenville, South Carolina, Carr allegedly also published using the name of Fenton Carter, but no works by anyone of this name have yet been identified.\\nCarr also wrote many radio scripts, particularly for the Suspense radio anthology series in America and for its UK equivalent Appointment With Fear introduced by Valentine Dyall, as well as many other dramas for the BBC, and some screenplays. His 1943 half-hour radio play Cabin B-13 was expanded into a series on CBS during 1948–49[6] for which Carr wrote all 23 scripts, basing some on earlier works or re-presenting devices that Chesterton had used.  The 1943 play Cabin B-13 was also expanded into the script for the 1953 movie Dangerous Crossing, directed by Joseph M. Newman and featuring Michael Rennie and Jeanne Crain.  Carr worked extensively for BBC Radio during World War II, writing both mystery stories and propaganda scripts. During the late 1940s he hosted Murder by Experts transmitted by Mutual radio. He introduced works by other mystery writers who were the week\\'s guest writers. The show originated from Mutual\\'s main station WOR in New York City. Many of these shows are available for free listening or downloading at the Internet Archive.\\nCarr\\'s works were the basis for several movies, including The Man With a Cloak (1951) and Dangerous Crossing (1953).  The Emperor\\'s Snuffbox was filmed as That Woman Opposite (1957), and La Chambre Ardente (1962) was a loose adaptation of The Burning Court.\\nVarious Carr stories formed the basis for episodes of television series, particularly those without recurring characters such as General Motors Presents.  During 1956, the television series Colonel March of Scotland Yard, featuring Boris Karloff as Colonel March, was based on Carr\\'s character and his stories and was broadcast for 26 episodes.\\nIn the early 1950s Boris Karloff played Col. March in a weekly television series Colonel March of Scotland Yard.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nRaymond Thornton Chandler (July 23, 1888 – March 26, 1959) was an American-British novelist and screenwriter. In 1932, at the age of forty-four, Chandler became a detective fiction writer after losing his job as an oil company executive during the Great Depression. His first short story, \"Blackmailers Don\\'t Shoot\", was published in 1933 in Black Mask, a popular pulp magazine. His first novel, The Big Sleep, was published in 1939. In addition to his short stories, Chandler published seven novels during his lifetime (an eighth, in progress at the time of his death, was completed by Robert B. Parker). All but Playback have been made into motion pictures, some more than once. In the year before his death, he was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America.[1]\\nChandler had an immense stylistic influence on American popular literature. He is a founder of the hardboiled school of detective fiction, along with Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain and other Black Mask writers. The protagonist of his novels, Philip Marlowe, like Hammett\\'s Sam Spade, is considered by some to be synonymous with \"private detective\". Both were played in films by Humphrey Bogart, whom many consider to be the quintessential Marlowe.\\nAt least three of Chandler\\'s novels have been regarded as masterpieces, including Farewell, My Lovely (1940), The Little Sister (1949), and The Long Goodbye (1953). The Long Goodbye was praised in an anthology of American crime stories as \"arguably the first book since Hammett\\'s The Glass Key, published more than twenty years earlier, to qualify as a serious and significant mainstream novel that just happened to possess elements of mystery\".[2]  Four of his novels appear on the British-based Crime Writers Association Poll (1990) of the best 100 crime fiction novels ever published.\\nChandler was born in 1888 in Chicago, the son of Florence Dart (Thornton) and Maurice Benjamin Chandler.[3] He spent his early years in Plattsmouth, Nebraska, living with his mother and father near his cousins and his aunt (his mother\\'s sister) and uncle.[4] Chandler\\'s father, an alcoholic civil engineer who worked for the railway, abandoned the family.[5] To obtain the best possible education for Ray, his mother, originally from Ireland, moved them to the area of Upper Norwood in what is now the London Borough of Croydon, England[6] in 1900.[7]  Another uncle, a successful lawyer in Waterford, Ireland, reluctantly supported them[8] \\nwhile they lived with Chandler\\'s maternal grandmother. Raymond was a first cousin to the actor Max Adrian, a founding member of the Royal Shakespeare Company; Max\\'s mother Mabel was a sister of Florence Thornton. Chandler was classically educated at Dulwich College, London (a public school whose alumni include the authors P. G. Wodehouse[8] and C. S. Forester). He spent some of his childhood summers in Waterford with his mother\\'s family.[9] He did not go to university, instead spending time in Paris and Munich improving his foreign language skills. In 1907, he was naturalized as a British subject in order to take the civil service examination, which he passed. He then took an Admiralty job, lasting just over a year. His first poem was published during that time.\\nChandler disliked the servility of the civil service and resigned, to the consternation of his family, became a reporter for the Daily Express and also wrote for The Westminster Gazette.[10] He was unsuccessful as a journalist, but he published reviews and continued writing romantic poetry. An encounter with the slightly older Richard Barham Middleton is said to have influenced him into postponing his career as writer. \"I met\\xa0... also a young, bearded, and sad-eyed man called Richard Middleton.\\xa0... Shortly afterwards he committed suicide in Antwerp, a suicide of despair, I should say. The incident made a great impression on me, because Middleton struck me as having far more talent than I was ever likely to possess; and if he couldn\\'t make a go of it, it wasn\\'t very likely that I could.\"  Accounting for that time he said, \"Of course in those days as now there were\\xa0... clever young men who made a decent living as freelances for the numerous literary weeklies\", but \"I was distinctly not a clever young man. Nor was I at all a happy young man.\"[11]\\nIn 1912, he borrowed money from his Waterford uncle, who expected it to be repaid with interest, and returned to America, visiting his aunt and uncle before settling in San Francisco for a time, where he took a correspondence course in bookkeeping, finishing ahead of schedule. His mother joined him there in late 1912. Encouraged by Chandler\\'s attorney/oilman friend Warren Lloyd, they moved to Los Angeles in 1913,[12] where he strung tennis rackets, picked fruit and endured a time of scrimping and saving. He found steady employment with the Los Angeles Creamery. In 1917, he traveled to Victoria, where in August he enlisted in the 50th Reinforcement Battalion Canadian Expeditionary Force.[13] He saw combat in the trenches in France with the 7th Battalion C.E.F. (British Columbia Regiment).[14] He was twice hospitalized with Spanish flu during the pandemic[15] and was undergoing flight training in the fledgling Royal Air Force (RAF) when the war ended.[8]\\nAfter the armistice, he returned to Los Angeles by way of Vancouver, and soon began a love affair with Pearl Eugenie (\"Cissy\") Pascal, a married woman 18 years his senior and the stepmother of Gordon Pascal, with whom Chandler had enlisted.[8] Cissy amicably divorced her husband, Julian, in 1920, but Chandler\\'s mother disapproved of the relationship and refused to sanction the marriage. For the next four years Chandler supported both his mother and Cissy. After the death of Florence Chandler on September 26, 1923, he was free to marry Cissy. They were married on February 6, 1924.[8][16] Having begun in 1922 as a bookkeeper and auditor, Chandler was by 1931 a highly paid vice president of the Dabney Oil Syndicate, but his alcoholism, absenteeism, promiscuity with female employees, and threatened suicides[8] contributed to his dismissal a year later.\\nIn straitened financial circumstances during the Great Depression, Chandler turned to his latent writing talent to earn a living, teaching himself to write pulp fiction by analyzing and imitating a novelette by Erle Stanley Gardner. Chandler\\'s first professional work, \"Blackmailers Don\\'t Shoot\", was published in Black Mask magazine in 1933. According to genre historian Herbert Ruhm, \"Chandler, who worked slowly and painstakingly, revising again and again, had taken five months to write the story.  Erle Stanley Gardner could turn out a pulp story in three or four days—and turned out an estimated one thousand.\"[17]\\nHis first novel, The Big Sleep, was published in 1939, featuring the detective Philip Marlowe, speaking in the first person.  In 1950, Chandler described in a letter to his English publisher, Hamish Hamilton, why he began reading pulp magazines and later wrote for them:\\nWandering up and down the Pacific Coast in an automobile I began to read pulp magazines, because they were cheap enough to throw away and because I never had at any time any taste for the kind of thing which is known as women\\'s magazines. This was in the great days of the Black Mask (if I may call them great days) and it struck me that some of the writing was pretty forceful and honest, even though it had its crude aspect. I decided that this might be a good way to try to learn to write fiction and get paid a small amount of money at the same time.  I spent five months over an 18,000 word novelette and sold it for $180. After that I never looked back, although I had a good many uneasy periods looking forward.[18]His second Marlowe novel, Farewell, My Lovely (1940), became the basis for three movie versions adapted by other screenwriters, including the 1944 film Murder My Sweet, which marked the screen debut of the Marlowe character, played by Dick Powell (whose depiction of Marlowe was applauded by Chandler). Literary success and film adaptations led to a demand for Chandler himself as a screenwriter. He and Billy Wilder co-wrote Double Indemnity (1944), based on James M. Cain\\'s novel of the same title. The noir screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award.[19] Said Wilder, \"I would just guide the structure and I would also do a lot of the dialogue, and he (Chandler) would then comprehend and start constructing too.\" Wilder acknowledged that the dialogue which makes the film so memorable was largely Chandler\\'s.\\nChandler\\'s only produced original screenplay was The Blue Dahlia (1946). He had not written a denouement for the script and, according to producer John Houseman, Chandler concluded he could finish the script only if drunk, with the assistance of round-the-clock secretaries and drivers, which Houseman agreed to. The script gained Chandler\\'s second Academy Award nomination for screenplay.[20]\\nChandler collaborated on the screenplay of Alfred Hitchcock\\'s Strangers on a Train (1951), an ironic murder story based on Patricia Highsmith\\'s novel, which he thought implausible. Chandler clashed with Hitchcock and they stopped talking after Hitchcock heard Chandler had referred to him as \"that fat bastard\".[21] Hitchcock made a show of throwing Chandler\\'s two draft screenplays into the studio trash can while holding his nose, but Chandler retained the lead screenwriting credit along with Czenzi Ormonde.\\nIn 1946, the Chandlers moved to La Jolla, an affluent coastal neighborhood of San Diego, California, where Chandler wrote two more Philip Marlowe novels, The Long Goodbye and his last completed work, Playback. The latter was derived from an unproduced courtroom drama screenplay he had written for Universal Studios.\\nFour chapters of a novel, unfinished at his death, were transformed into a final Philip Marlowe novel, Poodle Springs, by the mystery writer and Chandler admirer Robert B. Parker, in 1989. Parker shares the authorship with Chandler. Parker subsequently wrote a sequel to The Big Sleep entitled Perchance to Dream, which was salted with quotes from the original novel. Chandler\\'s final Marlowe short story, circa 1957, was entitled \"The Pencil\". It later provided the basis of an episode of the HBO miniseries (1983–86), Philip Marlowe, Private Eye, starring Powers Boothe as Marlowe.\\nIn 2014, \"The Princess and the Pedlar\" (1917), a previously unknown comic operetta, with libretto by Chandler and music by Julian Pascal, was discovered[22] among the uncatalogued holdings of the Library of Congress. The work was never published or produced. It has been dismissed by the Raymond Chandler estate as \"no more than… a curiosity.\"[23] A small team under the direction of the actor and director Paul Sand is seeking permission to produce the operetta in Los Angeles.\\nCissy Chandler died in 1954, after a long illness. Heartbroken and drunk, Chandler neglected to inter her cremated remains, and they sat for 57 years in a storage locker in the basement of Cypress View Mausoleum.\\nAfter Cissy\\'s death, Chandler\\'s loneliness worsened his propensity for clinical depression; he returned to drinking alcohol, never quitting it for long, and the quality and quantity of his writing suffered.[8] In 1955, he attempted suicide. In The Long Embrace: Raymond Chandler and the Woman He Loved, Judith Freeman says it was \"a cry for help,\" given that he called the police beforehand, saying he planned to kill himself. Chandler\\'s personal and professional life were both helped and complicated by the women to whom he was attracted, notably Helga Greene (his literary agent), Jean Fracasse (his secretary), Sonia Orwell (George Orwell\\'s widow), and Natasha Spender (Stephen Spender\\'s wife). Chandler regained his U.S. citizenship in 1956, while retaining his British rights.\\nAfter a respite in England, he returned to La Jolla. He died at Scripps Memorial Hospital of pneumonial peripheral vascular shock and prerenal uremia (according to the death certificate) in 1959. Helga Greene inherited Chandler\\'s $60,000 estate, after prevailing in a 1960 lawsuit filed by Fracasse contesting Chandler\\'s holographic codicil to his will.\\nChandler is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery, in San Diego, California. As Frank MacShane noted in his biography, The Life of Raymond Chandler, Chandler wished to be cremated and placed next to Cissy in Cypress View Mausoleum. Instead, he was buried in Mount Hope, because he had left no funeral or burial instructions.[24]\\nIn 2010, Chandler historian Loren Latker, with the assistance of attorney Aissa Wayne (daughter of John Wayne), brought a petition to disinter Cissy\\'s remains and reinter them with Chandler in Mount Hope. After a hearing in September 2010 in San Diego Superior Court, Judge Richard S. Whitney entered an order granting Latker\\'s request.[25]\\nOn February 14, 2011, Cissy\\'s ashes were conveyed from Cypress View to Mount Hope and interred under a new grave marker above Chandler\\'s, as they had wished.[26] About 100 people attended the ceremony, which included readings by the Rev. Randal Gardner, Powers Boothe, Judith Freeman and Aissa Wayne. The shared gravestone reads, \"Dead men are heavier than broken hearts\", a quotation from The Big Sleep. Chandler\\'s original gravestone, placed by Jean Fracasse and her children, is still at the head of his grave; the new one is at the foot.\\nIn his introduction to Trouble Is My Business (1950), a collection of many of his short stories, Chandler provided insight on the formula for the detective story and how the pulp magazines differed from previous detective stories:\\nThe emotional basis of the standard detective story was and had always been that murder will out and justice will be done. Its technical basis was the relative insignificance of everything except the final denouement. What led up to that was more or less passage work. The denouement would justify everything. The technical basis of the Black Mask type of story on the other hand was that the scene outranked the plot, in the sense that a good plot was one which made good scenes. The ideal mystery was one you would read if the end was missing.  We who tried to write it had the same point of view as the film makers. When I first went to Hollywood a very intelligent producer told me that you couldn\\'t make a successful motion picture from a mystery story, because the whole point was a disclosure that took a few seconds of screen time while the audience was reaching for its hat. He was wrong, but only because he was thinking of the wrong kind of mystery.Chandler also described the struggle that writers of pulp fiction had in following the formula demanded by the editors of the pulp magazines:\\nAs I look back on my stories it would be absurd if I did not wish they had been better. But if they had been much better they would not have been published. If the formula had been a little less rigid, more of the writing of that time might have survived. Some of us tried pretty hard to break out of the formula, but we usually got caught and sent back. To exceed the limits of a formula without destroying it is the dream of every magazine writer who is not a hopeless hack.[27] Critics and writers, including W. H. Auden, Evelyn Waugh and Ian Fleming, greatly admired Chandler\\'s prose.[8] In a radio discussion with Chandler, Fleming said that Chandler offered \"some of the finest dialogue written in any prose today\".[28] Contemporary mystery writer Paul Levine has described Chandler\\'s style as the \"literary equivalent of a quick punch to the gut\".[29] Chandler\\'s swift-moving, hardboiled style was inspired mostly by Dashiell Hammett, but his sharp and lyrical similes are original: \"The muzzle of the Luger looked like the mouth of the Second Street tunnel\"; \"He had a heart as big as one of Mae West\\'s hips\"; \"Dead men are heavier than broken hearts\"; \"I went back to the seasteps and moved down them as cautiously as a cat on a wet floor\"; \"He was crazy as a pair of waltzing mice, but I liked him\"; \"I felt like an amputated leg\"; \"He was about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food.\" Chandler\\'s writing redefined the private eye fiction genre, led to the coining of the adjective \"Chandleresque\", and inevitably became the subject of parody and pastiche. Yet the detective Philip Marlowe is not a stereotypical tough guy, but a complex, sometimes sentimental man with few friends, who attended university, who speaks some Spanish and sometimes admires Mexicans and Blacks, and who is a student of chess and classical music. He is a man who refuses a prospective client\\'s fee for a job he considers unethical.\\nThe high regard in which Chandler is generally held today is in contrast to the critical sniping that stung the author during his lifetime. In a March 1942 letter to Blanche Knopf, published in Selected Letters of Raymond Chandler, he wrote, \"The thing that rather gets me down is that when I write something that is tough and fast and full of mayhem and murder, I get panned for being tough and fast and full of mayhem and murder, and then when I try to tone down a bit and develop the mental and emotional side of a situation, I get panned for leaving out what I was panned for putting in the first time.\"\\nAlthough his work enjoys general acclaim today, Chandler has been criticized for certain aspects of his writing. The Washington Post reviewer Patrick Anderson described his plots as \"rambling at best and incoherent at worst\" (notoriously, even Chandler did not know who murdered the chauffeur in The Big Sleep[30]) and Anderson criticized Chandler\\'s treatment of black, female, and homosexual characters, calling him a \"rather nasty man at times\".[31][32] Anderson nevertheless praised Chandler as \"probably the most lyrical of the major crime writers\".[33]\\nChandler\\'s short stories and novels are evocatively written, conveying the time, place and ambiance of Los Angeles and environs in the 1930s and 1940s.[8] The places are real, if pseudonymous: Bay City is Santa Monica, Gray Lake is Silver Lake, and Idle Valley a synthesis of wealthy San Fernando Valley communities.\\nPlayback is the only one of his novels not to have been cinematically adapted. Arguably the most notable adaptation is The Big Sleep (1946), by Howard Hawks, with Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe. William Faulkner was a co-writer of the screenplay. Chandler\\'s few screenwriting efforts and the cinematic adaptation of his novels proved stylistically and thematically influential on the American film noir genre. Notable for its revised take on the Marlowe character, transplanting the novel to the 1970s, is Robert Altman\\'s 1973 neo-noir adaptation of The Long Goodbye.\\nChandler was also a perceptive critic of detective fiction; his essay \"The Simple Art of Murder\" is the canonical essay in the field.[34]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nLeslie Charteris (/ˈtʃɑːrtərɪs/; born Leslie Charles Bowyer-Yin; 12 May 1907 – 15 April 1993), was a British-Chinese author of adventure fiction, as well as a screenwriter.[1] He was best known for his many books chronicling the adventures of his hero Simon Templar, alias \"The Saint\".Charteris was born Leslie Charles Bowyer-Yin, in Singapore. His mother, Lydia Florence Bowyer, was English. His father, Dr S. C. Yin (Yin Suat Chuan, 1877–1958),[2] was a Chinese physician who claimed to be able to trace his lineage back to the emperors of the Shang dynasty.[1]\\nLeslie became interested in writing at an early age. At one point, he created his own magazine with articles, short stories, poems, editorials, serials, and even a comic strip. He attended Saint Andrew\\'s School, Singapore, and after moving to England, Rossall School in Fleetwood, Lancashire.\\nIn 1926, Leslie legally changed his surname to \"Charteris\". In the BBC Radio 4 documentary Leslie Charteris – A Saintly Centennial, his daughter stated that he had selected the name from a telephone directory. This information is contradicted by other sources, however.  William Ruehlmann (author of Saint with a Gun:  The Unlawful American Private Eye,[3] in an introduction to the 1988 edition of The Saint in New York, \"He acquired..., in 1928, the legal name of Charteris, after the roguish Col. Francis, gambler, duellist and founder of the Hellfire Club.\"[4]\\nCharteris wrote his first book during his first year at King\\'s College, Cambridge. Once it was accepted, he left the university and embarked on a new career, motivated by a desire to be unconventional and to become financially well off by doing what he liked to do. He continued to write British thriller stories while working at various jobs, from shipping out on a freighter to working as a barman in a country inn. He prospected for gold, dived for pearls, worked in a tin mine and on a rubber plantation, toured Britain with a carnival, and drove a bus.\\nCharteris\\'s third novel, Meet the Tiger (1928), introduced his most famous creation, Simon Templar.[5] However, in his 1980 introduction to a reprint by Charter Books, Charteris indicated he was dissatisfied with the work, suggesting its only value was as the start of the long-running Saint series. Occasionally, he chose to ignore the existence of Meet the Tiger altogether and claimed that the Saint series actually began with the second volume, Enter the Saint (1930); an example of this can be found in the introduction Charteris wrote to an early 1960s edition of Enter the Saint published by Fiction Publishing Company (an imprint of Doubleday).\\nCharteris wrote a few other books, including a novelization of his screenplay for the Deanna Durbin mystery-comedy Lady on a Train, and the English translation of Juan Belmonte: Killer of Bulls by Manuel Chaves Nogales. However, his lifework – at least in the literary world —  consisted primarily of Simon Templar Saint adventures, which were presented in the novel, novella, and short-story formats over the next 35 years. From 1963 onward, other authors ghost-wrote the stories, while Charteris acted as an editor, approving stories and making revisions when needed.\\nCharteris relocated to the United States in 1932, where he continued to publish short stories and also became a writer for Paramount Pictures, working on the George Raft film, Midnight Club.[6][page\\xa0needed] Charteris also wrote scripts for Alex Raymond\\'s newspaper comic Secret Agent X-9 in 1935 to 1936. One story was drawn by Raymond, and the other two by Raymond\\'s successor Charles Flanders. [7]\\nHowever, Charteris was excluded from permanent residency in the United States because of the Chinese Exclusion Act, a law which prohibited immigration for persons of \"50% or greater\" Oriental blood. As a result, Charteris was continually forced to renew his six-month temporary visitor\\'s visa. Eventually, an act of Congress personally granted his daughter and him the right of permanent residence in the United States, with eligibility for naturalization, which he later completed in 1946.[8][9]\\nIn 1936, Charteris was a passenger on the maiden voyage of the Hindenburg.[10] In America, The Saint became a radio series starring Vincent Price.  In the 1940s, Charteris, besides continuing to write The Saint stories, scripted the Sherlock Holmes radio series featuring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.[11][page\\xa0needed] In 1941, Charteris appeared in a Life photographic adaptation of a short story of The Saint, with himself playing the Saint.[12][13][page\\xa0needed]\\nLong-term success eluded Charteris\\' creation outside the literary arena until RKO produced an eight-film series between 1938 and 1943: \\nThe Saint in New York (1938) with Louis Hayward as The Saint;\\nThe Saint Strikes Back (1939), \\nThe Saint in London (1939, filmed on location), \\nThe Saint\\'s Double Trouble (1940),\\nThe Saint Takes Over (1940), and \\nThe Saint in Palm Springs (1941) all with George Sanders as The Saint. Another Briton, Hugh Sinclair, took over the role in The Saint\\'s Vacation (filmed by RKO\\'s British studio in 1941) and The Saint Meets the Tiger (again produced by RKO in 1941 but shelved until Republic Pictures released it in 1943).\\nA ninth film, The Saint\\'s Return (known as The Saint\\'s Girl Friday in the US) from 1953, with Louis Hayward returning as The Saint, is sometimes regarded as part of the RKO series. However, it was produced by British Hammer Film Productions, based on a special agreement between Hammer Films and Leslie Charteris, which gave Charteris a percentage in the film. RKO acted only as the film\\'s US distributor, six months after the UK release.\\nBoth George Sanders and Leslie Charteris had complaints about the Saint pictures; Sanders because he disliked playing the same role again and again, and Charteris because of the liberties taken by the screenwriters. RKO dropped the Saint series and replaced it with The Falcon, another debonair amateur sleuth played by Sanders. Charteris saw this as a ploy to deprive him of his royalties and sued RKO. Sanders bailed out of the Falcon series after three films, and was replaced by his brother, Tom Conway.\\nA film loosely based on the character simply titled The Saint was released in 1997 with Val Kilmer in the title role.\\nIn 1962–1969 the British-produced television series The Saint went into production with Roger Moore in the Simon Templar role.\\nMany episodes of the TV series were based upon Charteris\\' short stories. Later, as original scripts were commissioned, Charteris permitted some of these scripts to be novelized and published as further adventures of the Saint in printed form (these later books, with titles such as The Saint on TV and The Saint and the Fiction Makers, carried Charteris\\' name as author, but were in fact written by others). Charteris lived to see a second British TV series, Return of the Saint starring Ian Ogilvy as Simon Templar, enjoy a well-received, if brief, run in the late 1970s (with Charteris himself making a cameo appearance in one episode) and, in the 1980s, a series of TV movies produced by an international co-production and starring Simon Dutton kept interest in The Saint alive. Also, an ill-fated attempt at a 1980s TV series was made in the United States, which resulted in only a pilot episode being produced and broadcast. He also produced the original theme tune for the series, as can be seen in the end credits.\\nThe adventures of The Saint were chronicled in nearly 100 books (about 50 published in the UK and US, with others published in France). Charteris himself stepped away from writing the books after The Saint in the Sun (1963). The next year, Vendetta for the Saint was published and while it was credited to Charteris, it was actually written by science fiction writer Harry Harrison. Following Vendetta came a number of books adapting televised episodes, credited to Charteris, but written by others, although Charteris did collaborate on several Saint books in the 1970s. Charteris appears to have served in an editorial capacity for these later volumes. He also edited and contributed to The Saint Mystery Magazine, a digest-sized publication. The final book in the Saint series was Salvage for the Saint, published in 1983. Two additional books were published in 1997, a novelization of the film loosely based on the character, and an original novel published by \"The Saint Club\", a fan club that Charteris himself founded in the 1930s. Both books were written by Burl Barer, who also wrote the definitive history on Charteris and The Saint.\\nCharteris spent 55 years – 1928 to 1983 – as either writer of or custodian of Simon Templar\\'s literary adventures, one of the longest uninterrupted spans of a single author in the history of mystery fiction, equalling that of Agatha Christie, who wrote her novels and stories featuring detective Hercule Poirot.\\nA comic book adaptation of The Saint was produced in Sweden from 1969 to 1991 with at least 170 stories produced. As part of the contract, all story ideas had to be approved by Charteris himself before the story was completed. Among the creators of these stories were writers Norman Worker and Donne Avenell; the latter also co-wrote the novels The Saint and the Templar Treasure and the novella collection Count on the Saint, while Worker contributed to the novella collection Catch the Saint.\\nCharteris also wrote a column on cuisine for an American magazine, and invented a wordless, pictorial sign language called Paleneo, which he wrote a book about. Charteris was one of the earliest members of Mensa.[14][15]\\nCharteris married four times (see the Family section below for details).[16]  In 1952, Charteris married Hollywood actress Audrey Long (1922–2014); the couple eventually returned to England, where he spent his last years living in Surrey. Their address was Corfield, Ridgemead Road, Englefield Green.[17] He died at Princess Margaret\\'s Hospital Windsor, Berkshire, on 15 April 1993, survived by his wife and daughter, Patricia Charteris Higgins.[18] Audrey died at Egham, Surrey in September 2014, aged 92.[19]\\nHe was married four times:\\nCharteris was the brother of Rev Roy Bowyer-Yin.[21]\\nFor a list of all Charteris\\'s works, see List of works by Leslie Charteris; for a breakdown of Simon Templar novels, novellas and short story collections by Charteris, see the list at Simon Templar.\\nIn addition, Charteris authored numerous uncollected short stories and essays.[22]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nGilbert Keith Chesterton KC*SG (29 May 1874\\xa0– 14 June 1936) was an English writer,[2] philosopher, Christian apologist, and literary and art critic.\\nChesterton created the fictional priest-detective Father Brown,[3] and wrote on apologetics. Even some of those who disagree with him have recognised the wide appeal of such works as Orthodoxy and The Everlasting Man.[4][5] Chesterton routinely referred to himself as an orthodox Christian, and came to identify this position more and more with Catholicism, eventually converting from high church Anglicanism. Biographers have identified him as a successor to such Victorian authors as Matthew Arnold, Thomas Carlyle, John Henry Newman and John Ruskin.[6]\\nHe has been referred to as the \"prince of paradox\".[7] Of his writing style, Time observed: \"Whenever possible, Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, allegories—first carefully turning them inside out.\"[4] His writings were an influence on Jorge Luis Borges, who compared his literature with that of Edgar Allan Poe.[8]\\nChesterton was born in Campden Hill in Kensington, London, the son of Edward Chesterton (1841–1922), an estate agent, and Marie Louise, née Grosjean, of Swiss French origin.[9][10][11] Chesterton was baptised at the age of one month into the Church of England,[12] though his family themselves were irregularly practising Unitarians.[13] According to his autobiography, as a young man he became fascinated with the occult and, along with his brother Cecil, experimented with Ouija boards.[14] He was educated at St Paul\\'s School, then attended the Slade School of Art to become an illustrator. The Slade is a department of University College London, where Chesterton also took classes in literature, but he did not complete a degree in either subject. He married Frances Blogg in 1901; the marriage lasted the rest of his life. Chesterton credited Frances with leading him back to Anglicanism, though he later considered Anglicanism to be a \"pale imitation\". He entered in full communion with the Catholic Church in 1922.[15]  The couple were unable to have children.[16][17]\\nA friend from schooldays was Edmund Clerihew Bentley, inventor of the clerihew, a whimsical four-line biographical poem. Chesterton himself wrote clerihews and illustrated his friend\\'s first published collection of poetry, Biography for Beginners (1905), which popularised the clerihew form. He became godfather to Bentley\\'s son, Nicolas, and opened his novel The Man Who Was Thursday with a poem written to Bentley.\\nIn September 1895, Chesterton began working for the London publisher George Redway, where he remained for just over a year.[18] In October 1896 he moved to the publishing house T. Fisher Unwin,[18] where he remained until 1902. During this period he also undertook his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902 the Daily News gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in The Illustrated London News, for which he continued to write for the next thirty years.\\nEarly on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images.  Even his fiction contained carefully concealed parables. Father Brown is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition, repentance and reconciliation. For example, in the story \"The Flying Stars\", Father Brown entreats the character Flambeau to give up his life of crime: \"There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don\\'t fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it. Many a man I\\'ve known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime.\"[19]\\nChesterton loved to debate, often engaging in friendly public disputes with such men as George Bernard Shaw,[20] H. G. Wells, Bertrand Russell and Clarence Darrow.[21][22] According to his autobiography, he and Shaw played cowboys in a silent film that was never released.[23] On 7 January 1914 Chesterton (along with his brother Cecil and future sister-in-law Ada) took part in the mock-trial of John Jasper for the murder of Edwin Drood. Chesterton was Judge and George Bernard Shaw played the role of foreman of the jury.[24]\\nChesterton was a large man, standing 6\\xa0feet 4\\xa0inches (1.93\\xa0m) tall and weighing around 20\\xa0stone 6\\xa0pounds (130\\xa0kg; 286\\xa0lb). His girth gave rise to an anecdote during the First World War, when a lady in London asked why he was not \"out at the Front\"; he replied, \"If you go round to the side, you will see that I am.\"[25] On another occasion he remarked to his friend George Bernard Shaw, \"To look at you, anyone would think a famine had struck England.\"  Shaw retorted, \"To look at you, anyone would think you had caused it.\"[26] P. G. Wodehouse once described a very loud crash as \"a sound like G.\\xa0K. Chesterton falling onto a sheet of tin\".[27] Chesterton usually wore a cape and a crumpled hat, with a swordstick in hand, and a cigar hanging out of his mouth. He had a tendency to forget where he was supposed to be going and miss the train that was supposed to take him there. It is reported that on several occasions he sent a telegram to his wife Frances from an incorrect location, writing such things as \"Am in Market Harborough. Where ought I to be?\" to which she would reply, \"Home\".[28] Chesterton himself told this story, omitting, however, his wife\\'s alleged reply, in his autobiography.[29]\\nIn 1931, the BBC invited Chesterton to give a series of radio talks. He accepted, tentatively at first. However, from 1932 until his death, Chesterton delivered over 40 talks per year. He was allowed (and encouraged) to improvise on the scripts. This allowed his talks to maintain an intimate character, as did the decision to allow his wife and secretary to sit with him during his broadcasts.[30][page\\xa0needed] The talks were very popular. A BBC official remarked, after Chesterton\\'s death, that \"in another year or so, he would have become the dominating voice from Broadcasting House.\"[31] Chesterton was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1935.[32]\\nChesterton was part of the Detection Club, a society of British mystery authors founded by Anthony Berkeley in 1928. He was elected as the first president and served from 1930 to 1936 till he was succeeded by E. C. Bentley.[33]\\nChesterton died of congestive heart failure on 14 June 1936, aged 62, at his home in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. His last words were a greeting of good morning spoken to his wife Frances. The sermon at Chesterton\\'s Requiem Mass in Westminster Cathedral, London, was delivered by Ronald Knox on 27 June 1936. Knox said, \"All of this generation has grown up under Chesterton\\'s influence so completely that we do not even know when we are thinking Chesterton.\"[34] He is buried in Beaconsfield in the Catholic Cemetery. Chesterton\\'s estate was probated at £28,389, equivalent to £2,052,132 in 2021.[35]\\nNear the end of Chesterton\\'s life, Pope Pius XI invested him as Knight Commander with Star of the Papal Order of St Gregory the Great (KC*SG).[31] The Chesterton Society has proposed that he be beatified.[36]\\nChesterton wrote around 80 books, several hundred poems, some 200 short stories, 4,000 essays (mostly newspaper columns), and several plays. He was a literary and social critic, historian, playwright, novelist, and Catholic theologian[37][38] and apologist, debater, and mystery writer. He was a columnist for the Daily News, The Illustrated London News, and his own paper, G. K.\\'s Weekly; he also wrote articles for the Encyclopædia Britannica, including the entry on Charles Dickens and part of the entry on Humour in the 14th edition (1929). His best-known character is the priest-detective Father Brown,[3] who appeared only in short stories, while The Man Who Was Thursday is arguably his best-known novel. He was a convinced Christian long before he was received into the Catholic Church, and Christian themes and symbolism appear in much of his writing. In the United States, his writings on distributism were popularised through The American Review, published by Seward Collins in New York.\\nOf his nonfiction, Charles Dickens: A Critical Study (1906) has received some of the broadest-based praise. According to Ian Ker (The Catholic Revival in English Literature, 1845–1961, 2003), \"In Chesterton\\'s eyes Dickens belongs to Merry, not Puritan, England\"; Ker treats Chesterton\\'s thought in chapter 4 of that book as largely growing out of his true appreciation of Dickens, a somewhat shop-soiled property in the view of other literary opinions of the time. The biography was largely responsible for creating a popular revival for Dickens\\'s work as well as a serious reconsideration of Dickens by scholars.[39]\\nChesterton\\'s writings consistently displayed wit and a sense of humour. He employed paradox, while making serious comments on the world, government, politics, economics, philosophy, theology and many other topics.[40][41]\\nT. S. Eliot summed up his work as follows:\\nHe was importantly and consistently on the side of the angels. Behind the Johnsonian fancy dress, so reassuring to the British public, he concealed the most serious and revolutionary designs—concealing them by exposure\\xa0... Chesterton\\'s social and economic ideas\\xa0... were fundamentally Christian and Catholic. He did more, I think, than any man of his time—and was able to do more than anyone else, because of his particular background, development and abilities as a public performer—to maintain the existence of the important minority in the modern world. He leaves behind a permanent claim upon our loyalty, to see that the work that he did in his time is continued in ours.[42]Eliot commented further that \"His poetry was first-rate journalistic balladry, and I do not suppose that he took it more seriously than it deserved. He reached a high imaginative level with The Napoleon of Notting Hill, and higher with The Man Who Was Thursday, romances in which he turned the Stevensonian fantasy to more serious purpose. His book on Dickens seems to me the best essay on that author that has ever been written. Some of his essays can be read again and again; though of his essay-writing as a whole, one can only say that it is remarkable to have maintained such a high average with so large an output.\"[42]\\nIn 2022, a three-volume bibliography of Chesterton was published, listing 9000 contributions he made to newspapers, magazines, and journals, as well as 200 books and 3000 articles about him.[43]\\nChesterton is often associated with his close friend, the poet and essayist Hilaire Belloc.[44][45] George Bernard Shaw coined the name \"Chesterbelloc\"[46] for their partnership,[47] and this stuck. Though they were very different men, they shared many beliefs;[48] in 1922, Chesterton joined Belloc in the Catholic faith, and both voiced criticisms of capitalism and socialism.[49] They instead espoused a third way: distributism.[50] G.\\xa0K.\\'s Weekly, which occupied much of Chesterton\\'s energy in the last 15 years of his life, was the successor to Belloc\\'s New Witness, taken over from Cecil Chesterton, Gilbert\\'s brother, who died in World War I.\\nIn his book On the Place of Gilbert Chesterton in English Letters, Belloc wrote that \"Everything he wrote upon any one of the great English literary names was of the first quality.  He summed up any one pen (that of Jane Austen, for instance) in exact sentences; sometimes in a single sentence, after a fashion which no one else has approached.  He stood quite by himself in this department. He understood the very minds (to take the two most famous names) of Thackeray and of Dickens. He understood and presented Meredith. He understood the supremacy in Milton. He understood Pope. He understood the great Dryden. He was not swamped as nearly all his contemporaries were by Shakespeare, wherein they drown as in a vast sea – for that is what Shakespeare is. Gilbert Chesterton continued to understand the youngest and latest comers as he understood the forefathers in our great corpus of English verse and prose.\"[51]\\nIn his book Heretics, Chesterton said this of Oscar Wilde: \"The same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde. It is the carpe diem religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw.\"[52] More briefly, and with a closer approximation to Wilde\\'s own style, he wrote in his 1908 book Orthodoxy concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: \"Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde.\"\\nChesterton and George Bernard Shaw were famous friends and enjoyed their arguments and discussions. Although rarely in agreement, they each maintained good will toward, and respect for, the other.[53] In his writing, Chesterton expressed himself very plainly on where they differed and why. In Heretics he writes of Shaw:\\nAfter belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all. Having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr Shaw, not being easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr Shaw asks, not for a new kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man. It is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a new baby.[54]Chesterton\\'s views, in contrast to Shaw and others, became increasingly focused towards the Church. In Orthodoxy he wrote: \"The worship of will is the negation of will\\xa0... If Mr Bernard Shaw comes up to me and says, \\'Will something\\', that is tantamount to saying, \\'I do not mind what you will\\', and that is tantamount to saying, \\'I have no will in the matter.\\' You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will is that it is particular.\"[55]\\nChesterton\\'s The Everlasting Man contributed to C. S. Lewis\\'s conversion to Christianity. In a letter to Sheldon Vanauken (14 December 1950),[56] Lewis called the book \"the best popular apologetic I know\",[57] and to Rhonda Bodle he wrote (31 December 1947)[58] \"the [very] best popular defence of the full Christian position I know is G.\\xa0K. Chesterton\\'s The Everlasting Man\". The book was also cited in a list of 10 books that \"most shaped his vocational attitude and philosophy of life\".[59]\\nChesterton\\'s hymn \"O God of Earth and Altar\" was printed in The Commonwealth and then included in the English Hymnal in 1906.[60] Several lines of the hymn appear in the beginning of the song \"Revelations\" by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden on their 1983 album Piece of Mind.[61] Lead singer Bruce Dickinson in an interview stated \"I have a fondness for hymns. I love some of the ritual, the beautiful words, Jerusalem and there was another one, with words by G.\\xa0K. Chesterton O God of Earth and Altar – very fire and brimstone: \\'Bow down and hear our cry\\'. I used that for an Iron Maiden song, \"Revelations\". In my strange and clumsy way I was trying to say look it\\'s all the same stuff.\"[62]\\nÉtienne Gilson praised Chesterton\\'s book on Thomas Aquinas: \"I consider it as being, without possible comparison, the best book ever written on Saint Thomas\\xa0... the few readers who have spent twenty or thirty years in studying St. Thomas Aquinas, and who, perhaps, have themselves published two or three volumes on the subject, cannot fail to perceive that the so-called \\'wit\\' of Chesterton has put their scholarship to shame.\"[63]\\nArchbishop Fulton J. Sheen, the author of 70 books, identified Chesterton as the stylist who had the greatest impact on his own writing, stating in his autobiography Treasure in Clay, \"the greatest influence in writing was G.\\xa0K. Chesterton who never used a useless word, who saw the value of a paradox, and avoided what was trite.\"[64] Chesterton wrote the introduction to Sheen\\'s book God and Intelligence in Modern Philosophy; A Critical Study in the Light of the Philosophy of Saint Thomas.[65]\\nChesterton has been called \"The Apostle of Common Sense\".[66]  He was critical of the thinkers and popular philosophers of the day, who though very clever, were saying things that were nonsensical. This is illustrated again in Orthodoxy: \"Thus when Mr H. G. Wells says (as he did somewhere), \\'All chairs are quite different\\', he utters not merely a misstatement, but a contradiction in terms. If all chairs were quite different, you could not call them \\'all chairs\\'.\"[67] Or, again from Orthodoxy:\\nThe wild worship of lawlessness and the materialist worship of law end in the same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy in the land of nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless – one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan\\'s will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite\\'s will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is – well, some things are not hard to calculate. They stand at the crossroads.[68]Chesterton, as a political thinker, cast aspersions on both progressivism and conservatism, saying, \"The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of the Conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected.\"[69] He was an early member of the Fabian Society, but resigned at the time of the Boer War.[70]\\nChesterton first emerged as a journalist just after the turn of the 20th century. His great, and very lonely, opposition to the Second Boer War, set him very much apart from most of the rest of the British press.  Chesterton was a Little Englander, opposed to imperialism, British or otherwise. Chesterton thought that Great Britain betrayed her own principles in the Boer Wars. \\nIn vivid contrast to his opposition to the Boer Wars, Chesterton vigorously defended and encouraged the Allies in World War I. \"The war was in Chesterton\\'s eyes a crusade, and he was certain that England was right to fight as she had been wrong in fighting the Boers.\"[71] Chesterton saw the roots of the war in Prussian militarism. He was deeply disturbed by Prussia\\'s unprovoked invasion and occupation of neutral Belgium and by reports of shocking atrocities the Imperial German Army was allegedly committing in Belgium. Over the course of the War, Chesterton wrote hundreds of essays defending it, attacking pacifism, and exhorting the public to persevere until victory. Some of these essays were collected in the 1916 work, The Barbarism of Berlin.[72]\\nOne of Chesterton\\'s most successful works in support of the War was his 1915 tongue-in-cheek The Crimes of England.[73]  The work is masterfully ironic, supposedly apologizing and trying to help a fictitious Prussian professor named Whirlwind make the case for Prussia in WWI, while actually attacking Prussia throughout. Part of the book\\'s humorous impact is the conceit that Professor Whirlwind never realizes how his supposed benefactor is undermining Prussia at every turn. Chesterton \"blames\" England for historically building up Prussia against Austria, and for its pacifism, especially among wealthy British Quaker political donors, who prevented Britain from standing up to past Prussian aggression.\\nChesterton faced accusations of antisemitism during his lifetime, saying in his 1920 book The New Jerusalem that it was something \"for which my friends and I were for a long period rebuked and even reviled\".[74] Despite his protestations to the contrary, the accusation continues to be repeated.[75] An early supporter of Captain Dreyfus, by 1906 he had turned into an anti-dreyfusard.[76] From the early 20th century, his fictional work included caricatures of Jews, stereotyping them as greedy, cowardly, disloyal and communists.[77] Martin Gardner suggests that Four Faultless Felons was allowed to go out of print in the United States because of the \"anti-Semitism which mars so many pages.\"[78]\\nThe Marconi scandal of 1912–1913 brought issues of anti-Semitism into the political mainstream. Senior ministers in the Liberal government had secretly profited from advance knowledge of deals regarding wireless telegraphy, and critics regarded it as relevant that some of the key players were Jewish.[79] According to historian Todd Endelman, who identified Chesterton as among the most vocal critics, \"The Jew-baiting at the time of the Boer War and the Marconi scandal was linked to a broader protest, mounted in the main by the Radical wing of the Liberal Party, against the growing visibility of successful businessmen in national life and their challenge to what were seen as traditional English values.\"[80]\\nIn a work of 1917, titled A Short History of England, Chesterton considers the royal decree of 1290 by which Edward I expelled Jews from England, a policy that remained in place until 1655. Chesterton writes that popular perception of Jewish moneylenders could well have led Edward I\\'s subjects to regard him as a \"tender father of his people\" for \"breaking the rule by which the rulers had hitherto fostered their bankers\\' wealth\". He felt that Jews, \"a sensitive and highly civilized people\" who \"were the capitalists of the age, the men with wealth banked ready for use\", might legitimately complain that \"Christian kings and nobles, and even Christian popes and bishops, used for Christian purposes (such as the Crusades and the cathedrals) the money that could only be accumulated in such mountains by a usury they inconsistently denounced as unchristian; and then, when worse times came, gave up the Jew to the fury of the poor\".[81][82]\\nIn The New Jerusalem Chesterton dedicated a chapter to his views on the Jewish question: the sense that Jews were a distinct people without a homeland of their own, living as foreigners in countries where they were always a minority.[83] He wrote that in the past, his position:\\nwas always called Anti-Semitism; but it was always much more true to call it Zionism.\\xa0... my friends and I had in some general sense a policy in the matter; and it was in substance the desire to give Jews the dignity and status of a separate nation. We desired that in some fashion, and so far as possible, Jews should be represented by Jews, should live in a society of Jews, should be judged by Jews and ruled by Jews. I am an Anti-Semite if that is Anti-Semitism. It would seem more rational to call it Semitism.[84]In the same place he proposed the thought experiment (describing it as \"a parable\" and \"a flippant fancy\") that Jews should be admitted to any role in English public life on condition that they must wear distinctively Middle Eastern garb, explaining that \"The point is that we should know where we are; and he would know where he is, which is in a foreign land.\"[84]\\nChesterton, like Belloc, openly expressed his abhorrence of Hitler\\'s rule almost as soon as it started.[85] As Rabbi Stephen Wise wrote in a posthumous tribute to Chesterton in 1937:\\nWhen Hitlerism came, he was one of the first to speak out with all the directness and frankness of a great and unabashed spirit. Blessing to his memory![86]In The Truth About the Tribes Chesterton attacked German race theories, writing: \"the essence of Nazi Nationalism is to preserve the purity of a race in a continent where all races are impure\".[87]\\nThe historian Simon Mayers points out that Chesterton wrote in works such as The Crank, The Heresy of Race, and The Barbarian as Bore against the concept of racial superiority and critiqued pseudo-scientific race theories, saying they were akin to a new religion.[77] In The Truth About the Tribes Chesterton wrote, \"the curse of race religion is that it makes each separate man the sacred image which he worships. His own bones are the sacred relics; his own blood is the blood of St. Januarius\".[77] Mayers records that despite \"his hostility towards Nazi antisemitism … [it is unfortunate that he made] claims that \\'Hitlerism\\' was a form of Judaism, and that the Jews were partly responsible for race theory\".[77] In The Judaism of Hitler, as well as in A Queer Choice and The Crank, Chesterton made much of the fact that the very notion of \"a Chosen Race\" was of Jewish origin, saying in The Crank: \"If there is one outstanding quality in Hitlerism it is its Hebraism\" and \"the new Nordic Man has all the worst faults of the worst Jews: jealousy, greed, the mania of conspiracy, and above all, the belief in a Chosen Race\".[77]\\nMayers also shows that Chesterton portrayed Jews not only as culturally and religiously distinct, but racially as well. In The Feud of the Foreigner (1920) he said that the Jew \"is a foreigner far more remote from us than is a Bavarian from a Frenchman; he is divided by the same type of division as that between us and a Chinaman or a Hindoo. He not only is not, but never was, of the same race\".[77]\\nIn The Everlasting Man, while writing about human sacrifice, Chesterton suggested that medieval stories about Jews killing children might have resulted from a distortion of genuine cases of devil worship. Chesterton wrote:\\n[T]he Hebrew prophets were perpetually protesting against the Hebrew race relapsing into an idolatry that involved such a war upon children; and it is probable enough that this abominable apostasy from the God of Israel has occasionally appeared in Israel since, in the form of what is called ritual murder; not of course by any representative of the religion of Judaism, but by individual and irresponsible diabolists who did happen to be Jews.[77][88]The American Chesterton Society has devoted a whole issue of its magazine, Gilbert, to defending Chesterton against charges of antisemitism.[89] Likewise, Ann Farmer, author of Chesterton and the Jews: Friend, Critic, Defender,[90][91] writes, \"Public figures from Winston Churchill to Wells proposed remedies for the \\'Jewish problem\\'\\xa0– the seemingly endless cycle of anti-Jewish persecution\\xa0– all shaped by their worldviews. As patriots, Churchill and Chesterton embraced Zionism; both were among the first to defend the Jews from Nazism\", concluding that \"A defender of Jews in his youth\\xa0– a conciliator as well as a defender\\xa0– GKC returned to the defence when the Jewish people needed it most.\"[92]\\nIn Eugenics and Other Evils, Chesterton attacked eugenics as Parliament was moving towards passage of the Mental Deficiency Act 1913. Some backing the ideas of eugenics called for the government to sterilise people deemed \"mentally defective\"; this view did not gain popularity but the idea of segregating them from the rest of society and thereby preventing them from reproducing did gain traction. These ideas disgusted Chesterton who wrote, \"It is not only openly said, it is eagerly urged that the aim of the measure is to prevent any person whom these propagandists do not happen to think intelligent from having any wife or children.\"[93] He condemned the proposed wording for such measures as being so vague as to apply to anyone, including \"Every tramp who is sulk, every labourer who is shy, every rustic who is eccentric, can quite easily be brought under such conditions as were designed for homicidal maniacs. That is the situation; and that is the point\\xa0... we are already under the Eugenist State; and nothing remains to us but rebellion.\"[93] He derided such ideas as founded on nonsense, \"as if one had a right to dragoon and enslave one\\'s fellow citizens as a kind of chemical experiment\".[93] Chesterton mocked the idea that poverty was a result of bad breeding: \"[it is a] strange new disposition to regard the poor as a race; as if they were a colony of Japs or Chinese coolies\\xa0... The poor are not a race or even a type. It is senseless to talk about breeding them; for they are not a breed. They are, in cold fact, what Dickens describes: \\'a dustbin of individual accidents,\\' of damaged dignity, and often of damaged gentility.\"[93][94]\\n\"Chesterton\\'s fence\" is the principle that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood. The quotation is from Chesterton\\'s 1929 book, The Thing: Why I Am a Catholic, in the chapter, \"The Drift from Domesticity\":\\nIn the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, \\'I don\\'t see the use of this; let us clear it away.\\' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: \\'If you don\\'t see the use of it, I certainly won\\'t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.\\'[95]Inspired by Leo XIII\\'s encyclical Rerum Novarum, Chesterton\\'s brother Cecil and his friend, Hilaire Belloc were instrumental in developing the economic philosophy of distributism, a word Belloc coined. Gilbert embraced their views and, particularly after Cecil\\'s death in World War I, became one of the foremost distributists and the newspaper whose care he inherited from Cecil, which ultimately came to be named G.\\xa0K.\\'s Weekly, became its most consistent advocate.  Distributism stands as a third way, against both unrestrained capitalism, and socialism, advocating a wide distribution of both property and political power.\\nThe author James Parker, in The Atlantic, gave a modern appraisal:\\nIn his vastness and mobility, Chesterton continues to elude definition: He was a Catholic convert and an oracular man of letters, a pneumatic cultural presence, an aphorist with the production rate of a pulp novelist. Poetry, criticism, fiction, biography, columns, public debate...Chesterton was a journalist; he was a metaphysician. He was a reactionary; he was a radical. He was a modernist, acutely alive to the rupture in consciousness that produced Eliot\\'s \"The Hollow Men\"; he was an anti-modernist...a parochial Englishman and a post-Victorian gasbag; he was a mystic wedded to eternity. All of these cheerfully contradictory things are true...for the final, resolving fact that he was a genius. Touched once by the live wire of his thought, you don\\'t forget it\\xa0... His prose ... [is] supremely entertaining, the stately outlines of an older, heavier rhetoric punctually convulsed by what he once called (in reference to the Book of Job) \"earthquake irony\". He fulminates wittily; he cracks jokes like thunder. His message, a steady illumination beaming and clanging through every lens and facet of his creativity, was really very straightforward: get on your knees, modern man, and praise God.[96]The Bishop Emeritus of Northampton, Peter John Haworth Doyle, in 2012 had opened a preliminary investigation into possibly launching a cause for beatification and then canonization (for possible sainthood). but eventually decided not to open the cause. The current Bishop of Northampton, David James Oakley, has agreed to preach at a Mass during a Chesterton pilgrimage in England (the route goes through London and Beaconsfield, which are both connected to his life), and some have speculated he may be more favourable to the idea. If the cause is actually opened at the diocesan level (the Vatican must also give approval, that nothing stands in the way – the \"nihil obstat\"), then he could be given the title \"Servant of God\". It is not known if his alleged anti-Semitism (which would be considered a serious matter by the Church if it is true) may have played a role. His life and writings and views and what he did for others would be closely examined, in any case.[97]\\nChesterton\\'s socio-economic system of Distributism affected the sculptor Eric Gill, who established a commune of Catholic artists at Ditchling in Sussex. The Ditchling group developed a journal called The Game, in which they expressed many Chestertonian principles, particularly anti-industrialism and an advocacy of religious family life.[citation needed] His novel The Man Who Was Thursday inspired the Irish Republican leader Michael Collins with the idea that \"If you didn\\'t seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out.\"[98] Collins\\'s favourite work of Chesterton was The Napoleon of Notting Hill, and he was \"almost fanatically attached to it\", according to his friend Sir William Darling.[99] His column in the Illustrated London News on 18 September 1909 had a profound effect on Mahatma Gandhi.[100] P. N. Furbank asserts that Gandhi was \"thunderstruck\" when he read it,[101] while Martin Green notes that \"Gandhi was so delighted with this that he told Indian Opinion to reprint it\".[102] Another convert was Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan, who said that the book What\\'s Wrong with the World changed his life in terms of ideas and religion.[103] The author Neil Gaiman stated that he grew up reading Chesterton in his school\\'s library, and that The Napoleon of Notting Hill influenced his own book Neverwhere. Gaiman based the character Gilbert from the comic book The Sandman on Chesterton,[104] and Good Omens, the novel Gaiman co-wrote with Terry Pratchett, is dedicated to Chesterton. The Argentine author and essayist Jorge Luis Borges cited Chesterton as influential on his fiction, telling interviewer Richard Burgin that \"Chesterton knew how to make the most of a detective story\".[105]\\nChesterton\\'s many references to education and human formation have inspired a variety of educators including the 44 schools of the Chesterton Schools Network, which includes the Chesterton Academy founded by Dale Ahlquist.[106] and the Italian Scuola Libera G. K. Chesterton in San Benedetto del Tronto, Marche.[107] The publisher and educator Christopher Perrin (who completed his doctoral work on Chesterton) makes frequent reference to Chesterton in his work with classical schools.[108]\\nIn 1974, Father Ian Boyd, C.S.B, founded The Chesterton Review, a scholarly journal devoted to Chesterton and his circle. The journal is published by the G.\\xa0K. Chesterton Institute for Faith and Culture based in Seton Hall University, South Orange, New Jersey.[109]\\nIn 1996, Dale Ahlquist founded the American Chesterton Society to explore and promote Chesterton\\'s writings.[110]\\nIn 2008, a Catholic high school, Chesterton Academy, opened in the Minneapolis area. In the same year Scuola Libera Chesterton opened in San Benedetto del Tronto, Italy.[111]\\nIn 2012, a crater on the planet Mercury was named Chesterton after the author.[112]\\nIn 2014, G.\\xa0K. Chesterton Academy of Chicago, a Catholic high school, opened in Highland Park, Illinois.[113]\\nA fictionalised G.\\xa0K.

       " '\\nDame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie, Lady Mallowan, DBE (née\\xa0Miller; 15\\xa0September 1890\\xa0– 12\\xa0January 1976) was an English writer known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections, particularly those revolving around fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. She also wrote the world\\'s longest-running play, the murder mystery The Mousetrap, which has been performed in the West End since 1952. A writer during the \"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\", Christie has been called the \"Queen of Crime\". She also wrote six novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott. In 1971, she was made a Dame (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to literature. Guinness World Records lists Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time, her novels having sold more than two billion copies.\\nChristie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon, and was largely home-schooled. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed in 1920 when The Mysterious Affair at Styles, featuring detective Hercule Poirot, was published. Her first husband was Archibald Christie; they married in 1914 and had one child before divorcing in 1928. Following the breakdown of her marriage and the death of her mother in 1926 she made international headlines by going missing for eleven days. During both World Wars, she served in hospital dispensaries, acquiring a thorough knowledge of the poisons that featured in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. Following her marriage to archaeologist Max Mallowan in 1930, she spent several months each year on digs in the Middle East and used her first-hand knowledge of this profession in her fiction.\\nAccording to UNESCO\\'s Index Translationum, she remains the most-translated individual author.[1] Her novel And Then There Were None is one of the top-selling books of all time, with approximately 100 million copies sold. Christie\\'s stage play The Mousetrap holds the world record for the longest initial run. It opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End on 25\\xa0November 1952, and by 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances. The play was temporarily closed in 2020 because of COVID-19 lockdowns in London before it reopened in 2021.\\nIn 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America\\'s Grand Master Award. Later that year, Witness for the Prosecution received an Edgar Award for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the Crime Writers\\' Association. In 2015, And Then There Were None was named the \"World\\'s Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author\\'s estate.[2] Many of Christie\\'s books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and graphic novels. More than 30 feature films are based on her work.\\nAgatha Mary Clarissa Miller was born on 15\\xa0September 1890, into a wealthy upper middle class family in Torquay, Devon. She was the youngest of three children born to Frederick Alvah Miller, \"a gentleman of substance\",[3] and his wife Clarissa Margaret \"Clara\" Miller, née Boehmer.[4]:\\u200a1–4\\u200a[5][6][7]\\nChristie\\'s mother Clara was born in Dublin in 1854[a] to British Army officer Frederick Boehmer[10] and his wife Mary Ann Boehmer (née West). Boehmer died in Jersey in 1863,[b] leaving his widow to raise Clara and her brothers on a meagre income.[11][14]:\\u200a10\\u200a Two weeks after Boehmer\\'s death, Mary\\'s sister Margaret West married widowed dry goods merchant Nathaniel Frary Miller, a US citizen.[15] To assist Mary financially, they agreed to foster nine-year-old Clara; the family settled in Timperley, Cheshire.[16] Margaret and Nathaniel had no children together, but Nathaniel had a 17-year-old son, Fred Miller, from his previous marriage. Fred was born in New York City and travelled extensively after leaving his Swiss boarding school.[14]:\\u200a12\\u200a He and Clara were married in London in 1878.[4]:\\u200a2–5\\u200a[5] Their first child, Margaret Frary (\"Madge\"), was born in Torquay in 1879.[4]:\\u200a6\\u200a[17] The second, Louis Montant (\"Monty\"), was born in Morristown, New Jersey, in 1880,[18] while the family was on an extended visit to the United States.[12]:\\u200a7\\u200a\\nWhen Fred\\'s father died in 1869,[19] he left Clara £2,000 (approximately equivalent to £200,000 in 2021); in 1881 they used this to buy the leasehold of a villa in Torquay named Ashfield.[20][21] It was here that their third and last child, Agatha, was born in 1890.[4]:\\u200a6–7\\u200a[7] She described her childhood as \"very happy\".[12]:\\u200a3\\u200a The Millers lived mainly in Devon but often visited her step-grandmother/great-aunt Margaret Miller in Ealing and maternal grandmother Mary Boehmer in Bayswater.[12]:\\u200a26–31\\u200a A year was spent abroad with her family, in the French Pyrenees, Paris, Dinard, and Guernsey.[4]:\\u200a15,\\u200a24–25\\u200a Because her siblings were so much older, and there were few children in their neighbourhood, Christie spent much of her time playing alone with her pets and imaginary companions.[12]:\\u200a9–10,\\u200a86–88\\u200a She eventually made friends with other girls in Torquay, noting that \"one of the highlights of my existence\" was her appearance with them in a youth production of Gilbert and Sullivan\\'s The Yeomen of the Guard, in which she played the hero, Colonel Fairfax.[4]:\\u200a23–27\\u200a\\nAccording to Christie, Clara believed she should not learn to read until she was eight; thanks to her curiosity, she was reading by the age of four.[12]:\\u200a13\\u200a Her sister had been sent to a boarding school, but their mother insisted that Christie receive her education at home. As a result, her parents and sister supervised her studies in reading, writing and basic arithmetic, a subject she particularly enjoyed. They also taught her music, and she learned to play the piano and the mandolin.[4]:\\u200a8,\\u200a20–21\\u200a\\nChristie was a voracious reader from an early age. Among her earliest memories were of reading children\\'s books by Mrs Molesworth and Edith Nesbit. When a little older, she moved on to the surreal verse of Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll.[4]:\\u200a18–19\\u200a As an adolescent, she enjoyed works by Anthony Hope, Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, and Alexandre Dumas.[12]:\\u200a111,\\u200a136–37\\u200a In April 1901, aged 10, she wrote her first poem, \"The Cow Slip\".[22]\\nBy 1901, her father\\'s health had deteriorated, because of what he believed were heart problems.[14]:\\u200a33\\u200a Fred died in November 1901 from pneumonia and chronic kidney disease.[23] Christie later said that her father\\'s death when she was 11 marked the end of her childhood.[4]:\\u200a32–33\\u200a\\nThe family\\'s financial situation had, by this time, worsened. Madge married the year after their father\\'s death and moved to Cheadle, Cheshire; Monty was overseas, serving in a British regiment.[14]:\\u200a43,\\u200a49\\u200a Christie now lived alone at Ashfield with her mother. In 1902, she began attending Miss Guyer\\'s Girls\\' School in Torquay but found it difficult to adjust to the disciplined atmosphere.[12]:\\u200a139\\u200a In 1905, her mother sent her to Paris, where she was educated in a series of pensionnats (boarding schools), focusing on voice training and piano playing. Deciding she lacked the temperament and talent, she gave up her goal of performing professionally as a concert pianist or an opera singer.[14]:\\u200a59–61\\u200a\\nAfter completing her education, Christie returned to England to find her mother ailing. They decided to spend the northern winter of 1907–1908 in the warm climate of Egypt, which was then a regular tourist destination for wealthy Britons.[12]:\\u200a155–57\\u200a They stayed for three months at the Gezirah Palace Hotel in Cairo. Christie attended many dances and other social functions; she particularly enjoyed watching amateur polo matches. While they visited some ancient Egyptian monuments such as the Great Pyramid of Giza, she did not exhibit the great interest in archaeology and Egyptology that developed in her later years.[4]:\\u200a40–41\\u200a Returning to Britain, she continued her social activities, writing and performing in amateur theatrics. She also helped put on a play called The Blue Beard of Unhappiness with female friends.[4]:\\u200a45–47\\u200a\\nAt 18, Christie wrote her first short story, \"The House of Beauty\", while recovering in bed from an illness. It consisted of about 6,000 words about \"madness and dreams\", subjects of fascination for her. Her biographer Janet Morgan has commented that, despite \"infelicities of style\", the story was \"compelling\".[4]:\\u200a48–49\\u200a (The story became an early version of her story \"The House of Dreams\".)[24] Other stories followed, most of them illustrating her interest in spiritualism and the paranormal. These included \"The Call of Wings\" and \"The Little Lonely God\". Magazines rejected all her early submissions, made under pseudonyms (including Mac Miller, Nathaniel Miller, and Sydney West); some submissions were later revised and published under her real name, often with new titles.[4]:\\u200a49–50\\u200a\\nAround the same time, Christie began work on her first novel, Snow Upon the Desert. Writing under the pseudonym Monosyllaba, she set the book in Cairo and drew upon her recent experiences there. She was disappointed when the six publishers she contacted declined the work.[4]:\\u200a50–51\\u200a[25] Clara suggested that her daughter ask for advice from the successful novelist Eden Phillpotts, a family friend and neighbour, who responded to her enquiry, encouraged her writing, and sent her an introduction to his own literary agent, Hughes Massie, who also rejected Snow Upon the Desert but suggested a second novel.[4]:\\u200a51–52\\u200a\\nMeanwhile, Christie\\'s social activities expanded, with country house parties, riding, hunting, dances, and roller skating.[12]:\\u200a165–66\\u200a She had short-lived relationships with four men and an engagement to another.[14]:\\u200a64–67\\u200a In October 1912, she was introduced to Archibald \"Archie\" Christie at a dance given by Lord and Lady Clifford at Ugbrooke, about 12 miles (19\\xa0km) from Torquay. The son of a barrister in the Indian Civil Service, Archie was a Royal Artillery officer who was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps in April 1913.[26] The couple quickly fell in love. Three months after their first meeting, Archie proposed marriage, and Agatha accepted.[4]:\\u200a54–63\\u200a\\nWith the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Archie was sent to France to fight. They married on Christmas Eve 1914 at Emmanuel Church, Clifton, Bristol, close to the home of his mother and stepfather, when Archie was on home leave.[27][28] Rising through the ranks, he was posted back to Britain in September 1918 as a colonel in the Air Ministry. Christie involved herself in the war effort as a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross. From October 1914 to May 1915, then from June 1916 to September 1918, she worked 3,400 hours in the Town Hall Red Cross Hospital, Torquay, first as a nurse (unpaid) then as a dispenser at £16 (approximately equivalent to £950 in 2021) a year from 1917 after qualifying as an apothecary\\'s assistant.[4]:\\u200a69\\u200a[29] Her war service ended in September 1918 when Archie was reassigned to London, and they rented a flat in St. John\\'s Wood.[4]:\\u200a73–74\\u200a\\nChristie had long been a fan of detective novels, having enjoyed Wilkie Collins\\'s The Woman in White and The Moonstone, and Arthur Conan Doyle\\'s early Sherlock Holmes stories. She wrote her first detective novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, in 1916. It featured Hercule Poirot, a former Belgian police officer with \"magnificent moustaches\" and a head \"exactly the shape of an egg\",[30]:\\u200a13\\u200a who had taken refuge in Britain after Germany invaded Belgium. Christie\\'s inspiration for the character came from Belgian refugees living in Torquay, and the Belgian soldiers she helped to treat as a volunteer nurse during the First World War.[4]:\\u200a75–79\\u200a[31]:\\u200a17–18\\u200a Her original manuscript was rejected by Hodder & Stoughton and Methuen. After keeping the submission for several months, John Lane at The Bodley Head offered to accept it, provided that Christie change how the solution was revealed. She did so, and signed a contract committing her next five books to The Bodley Head, which she later felt was exploitative.[4]:\\u200a79,\\u200a81–82\\u200a It was published in 1920.[22]\\nChristie settled into married life, giving birth to her only child, Rosalind Margaret Clarissa (later Hicks), in August 1919 at Ashfield.[4]:\\u200a79\\u200a[14]:\\u200a340,\\u200a349,\\u200a422\\u200a Archie left the Air Force at the end of the war and began working in the City financial sector on a relatively low salary. They still employed a maid.[4]:\\u200a80–81\\u200a Her second novel, The Secret Adversary (1922), featured a new detective couple Tommy and Tuppence, again published by The Bodley Head. It earned her £50 (approximately equivalent to £2,900 in 2021). A third novel, Murder on the Links, again featured Poirot, as did the short stories commissioned by Bruce Ingram, editor of The Sketch magazine, from 1923.[4]:\\u200a83\\u200a She now had no difficulty selling her work.[30]:\\u200a33\\u200a\\nIn 1922, the Christies joined an around-the-world promotional tour for the British Empire Exhibition, led by Major Ernest Belcher. Leaving their daughter with Agatha\\'s mother and sister, in 10 months they travelled to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Canada.[4]:\\u200a86–103\\u200a[32] They learned to surf prone in South Africa; then, in Waikiki, they were among the first Britons to surf standing up, and extended their time there by three months to practise.[33][34]  She is remembered at the British Surfing Museum as having said  about surfing, \"Oh it was heaven! Nothing like rushing through the water at what seems to you a speed of about two hundred miles an hour. It is one of the most perfect physical pleasures I have known.\"[35]\\nWhen they returned to England, Archie resumed work in the city, and Christie continued to work hard at her writing. After living in a series of apartments in London, they bought a house in Sunningdale, Berkshire, which they renamed Styles after the mansion in Christie\\'s first detective novel.[4]:\\u200a124–25\\u200a[14]:\\u200a154–55\\u200a\\nChristie\\'s mother, Clarissa Miller, died in April 1926. They had been exceptionally close, and the loss sent Christie into a deep depression.[14]:\\u200a168–72\\u200a In August 1926, reports appeared in the press that Christie had gone to a village near Biarritz to recuperate from a \"breakdown\" caused by \"overwork\".[36]\\nIn August 1926, Archie asked Agatha for a divorce. He had fallen in love with Nancy Neele, a friend of Major Belcher.[14]:\\u200a173–74\\u200a On 3\\xa0December 1926, the pair quarrelled after Archie announced his plan to spend the weekend with friends, unaccompanied by his wife. Late that evening, Christie disappeared from their home in Sunningdale. The following morning, her car, a Morris Cowley, was discovered at Newlands Corner in Surrey, parked above a chalk quarry with an expired driving licence and clothes inside.[37][38] It was feared that she might have drowned herself in the Silent Pool, a nearby beauty spot.[39]\\nThe disappearance quickly became a news story.  The press sought to satisfy their readers\\' \"hunger for sensation, disaster, and scandal\".[14]:\\u200a224\\u200a Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks pressured police, and a newspaper offered a £100 reward (equivalent to £6,400 in 2021). More than 1,000 police officers, 15,000 volunteers, and several aeroplanes searched the rural landscape. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gave a spirit medium one of Christie\\'s gloves to find her.[c] Christie\\'s disappearance made international headlines, including featuring on the front page of The New York Times.[41][42] Despite the extensive manhunt, she was not found for another 10 days.[40][43][44] On 14\\xa0December 1926, she was located at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in Harrogate, Yorkshire, 184 miles (296\\xa0km) north of her home in Sunningdale, registered as \"Mrs Tressa[d] Neele\" (the surname of her husband\\'s lover) from \"Capetown [sic] S.A.\" (South Africa).[46] The next day, Christie left for her sister\\'s residence at Abney Hall, Cheadle, where she was sequestered \"in guarded hall, gates locked, telephone cut off, and callers turned away\".[45][47][48][49]\\nChristie\\'s autobiography makes no reference to the disappearance.[12] Two doctors diagnosed her with \"an unquestionable genuine loss of memory\",[49][50] yet opinion remains divided over the reason for her disappearance. Some, including her biographer Morgan, believe she disappeared during a fugue state.[4]:\\u200a154–59\\u200a[40][51] The author Jared Cade concluded that Christie planned the event to embarrass her husband but did not anticipate the resulting public melodrama.[52]:\\u200a121\\u200a Christie biographer Laura Thompson provides an alternative view that Christie disappeared during a nervous breakdown, conscious of her actions but not in emotional control of herself.[14]:\\u200a220–21\\u200a Public reaction at the time was largely negative, supposing a publicity stunt or an attempt to frame her husband for murder.[53][e]\\nIn January 1927, Christie, looking \"very pale\", sailed with her daughter and secretary to Las Palmas, Canary Islands, to \"complete her convalescence\",[54] returning three months later.[55][f] Christie petitioned for divorce and was granted a decree nisi against her husband in April 1928, which was made absolute in October 1928. Archie married Nancy Neele a week later.[56] Christie retained custody of their daughter, Rosalind, and kept the Christie surname for her writing.[31]:\\u200a21\\u200a[57]\\nReflecting on the period in her autobiography, Christie wrote, \"So, after illness, came sorrow, despair and heartbreak. There is no need to dwell on it.\"[12]:\\u200a340\\u200a\\nIn 1928, Christie left England and took the (Simplon) Orient Express to Istanbul and then to Baghdad.[4]:\\u200a169–70\\u200a In Iraq, she became friends with archaeologist Leonard Woolley and his wife, who invited her to return to their dig in February 1930.[12]:\\u200a376–77\\u200a On that second trip, she met archaeologist Max Mallowan, 13 years her junior.[14]:\\u200a284\\u200a In a 1977 interview, Mallowan recounted his first meeting with Christie, when he took her and a group of tourists on a tour of his expedition site in Iraq.[58] Christie and Mallowan married in Edinburgh in September 1930.[14]:\\u200a295–96\\u200a[59] Their marriage lasted until Christie\\'s death in 1976.[14]:\\u200a413–14\\u200a She accompanied Mallowan on his archaeological expeditions, and her travels with him contributed background to several of her novels set in the Middle East.[58] Other novels (such as Peril at End House) were set in and around Torquay, where she was raised.[30]:\\u200a95\\u200a Christie drew on her experience of international train travel when writing her 1934 novel Murder on the Orient Express.[4]:\\u200a201\\u200a The Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul, the eastern terminus of the railway, claims the book was written there and maintains Christie\\'s room as a memorial to the author.[60][g]\\nChristie and Mallowan first lived in Cresswell Place in Chelsea, and later in Sheffield Terrace, Holland Park, Kensington. Both properties are now marked by blue plaques. In 1934, they bought Winterbrook House in Winterbrook, a hamlet near Wallingford.[61] This was their main residence for the rest of their lives and the place where Christie did much of her writing.[14]:\\u200a365\\u200a This house also bears a blue plaque. Christie led a quiet life despite being known in Wallingford; from 1951 to 1976 she served as president of the local amateur dramatic society.[62]\\nThe couple acquired the Greenway Estate in Devon as a summer residence in 1938;[14]:\\u200a310\\u200a it was given to the National Trust in 2000.[63] Christie frequently stayed at Abney Hall, Cheshire, which was owned by her brother-in-law, James Watts, and based at least two stories there: a short story, \"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding\", in the story collection of the same name and the novel After the Funeral.[12]:\\u200a126\\u200a[14]:\\u200a43\\u200a One Christie compendium notes that \"Abney became Agatha\\'s greatest inspiration for country-house life, with all its servants and grandeur being woven into her plots. The descriptions of the fictional Chimneys, Stonygates, and other houses in her stories are mostly Abney Hall in various forms.\"[64]\\nDuring World War II, Christie moved to London and lived in a flat at the Isokon in Hampstead, whilst working in the pharmacy at University College Hospital (UCH), London, where she updated her knowledge of poisons.[65] Her later novel The Pale Horse was based on a suggestion from Harold Davis, the chief pharmacist at UCH. In 1977, a thallium poisoning case was solved by British medical personnel who had read Christie\\'s book and recognised the symptoms she described.[66][67]\\nThe British intelligence agency MI5 investigated Christie after a character called Major Bletchley appeared in her 1941 thriller N or M?, which was about a hunt for a pair of deadly fifth columnists in wartime England.[68] MI5 was concerned that Christie had a spy in Britain\\'s top-secret codebreaking centre, Bletchley Park. The agency\\'s fears were allayed when Christie told her friend, the codebreaker Dilly Knox, \"I was stuck there on my way by train from Oxford to London and took revenge by giving the name to one of my least lovable characters.\"[68]\\nChristie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1950.[31]:\\u200a23\\u200a In honour of her many literary works, Christie was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours.[69] She was co-president of the Detection Club from 1958 to her death in 1976.[30]:\\u200a93\\u200a In 1961, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature degree by the University of Exeter.[31]:\\u200a23\\u200a In the 1971 New Year Honours, she was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE),[70][71][72] three years after her husband had been knighted for his archaeological work.[73] After her husband\\'s knighthood, Christie could also be styled Lady Mallowan.[30]:\\u200a343\\u200a\\nFrom 1971 to 1974, Christie\\'s health began to fail, but she continued to write. Her last novel was Postern of Fate in 1973.[4]:\\u200a368–72\\u200a[14]:\\u200a477\\u200a Textual analysis suggested that Christie may have begun to develop Alzheimer\\'s disease or other dementia at about this time.[74][75]\\nIn 1946, Christie said of herself: \"My chief dislikes are crowds, loud noises, gramophones and cinemas. I dislike the taste of alcohol and do not like smoking. I do like sun, sea, flowers, travelling, strange foods, sports, concerts, theatres, pianos, and doing embroidery.\"[76]\\nChristie was a lifelong, \"quietly devout\"[4]:\\u200a183\\u200a member of the Church of England, attended church regularly, and kept her mother\\'s copy of The Imitation of Christ by her bedside.[14]:\\u200a30,\\u200a290\\u200a After her divorce, she stopped taking the sacrament of communion.[14]:\\u200a263\\u200a\\nThe Agatha Christie Trust For Children was established in 1969,[77] and shortly after Christie\\'s death a charitable memorial fund was set up to \"help two causes that she favoured: old people and young children\".[78]\\nChristie\\'s obituary in The Times notes that \"she never cared much for the cinema, or for wireless and television.\" Further,\\nDame Agatha\\'s private pleasures were gardening\\xa0– she won local prizes for horticulture\\xa0– and buying furniture for her various houses. She was a shy person: she disliked public appearances, but she was friendly and sharp-witted to meet. By inclination as well as breeding, she belonged to the English upper middle class. She wrote about, and for, people like herself. That was an essential part of her charm.[3]Christie died peacefully on 12\\xa0January 1976 at age 85 from natural causes at her home at Winterbrook House.[79][80] Upon her death, two West End theatres\\xa0– the St. Martin\\'s, where The Mousetrap was playing, and the Savoy, which was home to a revival of Murder at the Vicarage\\xa0– dimmed their outside lights in her honour.[30]:\\u200a373\\u200a She was buried in the nearby churchyard of St Mary\\'s, Cholsey, in a plot she had chosen with her husband 10 years previously. The simple funeral service was attended by about 20 newspaper and TV reporters, some having travelled from as far away as South America. Thirty wreaths adorned Christie\\'s grave, including one from the cast of her long-running play The Mousetrap and one sent \"on behalf of the multitude of grateful readers\" by the Ulverscroft Large Print Book Publishers.[81]\\nMallowan, who remarried in 1977, died in 1978 and was buried next to Christie.[82]\\nChristie was unhappy about becoming \"an employed wage slave\",[14]:\\u200a428\\u200a and for tax reasons set up a private company in 1955, Agatha Christie Limited, to hold the rights to her works. In about 1959 she transferred her 278-acre home, Greenway Estate, to her daughter, Rosalind Hicks.[83][84] In 1968, when Christie was almost 80, she sold a 51% stake in Agatha Christie Limited (and the works it owned) to Booker Books (better known as Booker Author\\'s Division), which by 1977 had increased its stake to 64%.[4]:\\u200a355\\u200a[85] Agatha Christie Limited still owns the worldwide rights for more than 80 of Christie\\'s novels and short stories, 19 plays, and nearly 40 TV films.[86]\\nIn the late 1950s, Christie had reputedly been earning around £100,000 (approximately equivalent to £2,500,000 in 2021) per year. Christie sold an estimated 300 million books during her lifetime.[87] At the time of her death in 1976, \"she was the best-selling novelist in history.\"[88]\\nOne estimate of her total earnings from more than a half-century of writing is $20\\xa0million (approximately $102.9\\xa0million in 2022).[89] As a result of her tax planning, her will left only £106,683[h] (approximately equivalent to £817,000 in 2021) net, which went mostly to her husband and daughter along with some smaller bequests.[79][91] Her remaining 36% share of Agatha Christie Limited was inherited by Hicks, who passionately preserved her mother\\'s works, image, and legacy until her own death 28 years later.[83] The family\\'s share of the company allowed them to appoint 50% of the board and the chairman, and retain a veto over new treatments, updated versions, and republications of her works.[83][92]\\nIn 2004, Hicks\\' obituary in The Telegraph noted that she had been \"determined to remain true to her mother\\'s vision and to protect the integrity of her creations\" and disapproved of \"merchandising\" activities.[83] Upon her death on 28\\xa0October 2004, the Greenway Estate passed to her son Mathew Prichard. After his stepfather\\'s death in 2005, Prichard donated Greenway and its contents to the National Trust.[83][94]\\nChristie\\'s family and family trusts, including great-grandson James Prichard, continue to own the 36% stake in Agatha Christie Limited,[86] and remain associated with the company. In 2020, James Prichard was the company\\'s chairman.[95] Mathew Prichard also holds the copyright to some of his grandmother\\'s later literary works including The Mousetrap.[14]:\\u200a427\\u200a Christie\\'s work continues to be developed in a range of adaptations.[96]\\nIn 1998, Booker sold its shares in Agatha Christie Limited (at the time earning £2,100,000, approximately equivalent to £3,900,000 in 2021 annual revenue) for £10,000,000 (approximately equivalent to £18,700,000 in 2021) to Chorion, whose portfolio of authors\\' works included the literary estates of Enid Blyton and Dennis Wheatley.[92] In February 2012, after a management buyout, Chorion began to sell off its literary assets.[86] This included the sale of Chorion\\'s 64% stake in Agatha Christie Limited to Acorn Media UK.[97] In 2014, RLJ Entertainment Inc. (RLJE) acquired Acorn Media UK, renamed it Acorn Media Enterprises, and incorporated it as the RLJE UK development arm.[98]\\nIn late February 2014, media reports stated that the BBC had acquired exclusive TV rights to Christie\\'s works in the UK (previously associated with ITV) and made plans with Acorn\\'s co-operation to air new productions for the 125th anniversary of Christie\\'s birth in 2015.[99] As part of that deal, the BBC broadcast Partners in Crime[100] and And Then There Were None,[101] both in 2015.[102] Subsequent productions have included The Witness for the Prosecution[103] but plans to televise Ordeal by Innocence at Christmas 2017 were delayed because of controversy surrounding one of the cast members.[104] The three-part adaptation aired in April 2018.[105] A three-part adaptation of The A.B.C. Murders starring John Malkovich and Rupert Grint began filming in June 2018 and was first broadcast in December 2018.[106][107] A two-part adaptation of The Pale Horse was broadcast on BBC1 in February 2020.[108] Death Comes as the End will be the next BBC adaptation.[109]\\nSince 2020, reissues of Christie\\'s Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot novels by HarperCollins have removed \"passages containing descriptions, insults or references to ethnicity\".[110]\\nChristie\\'s first published book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, was released in 1920 and introduced the detective Hercule Poirot, who appeared in 33 of her novels and more than 50 short stories.\\nOver the years, Christie grew tired of Poirot, much as Doyle did with Sherlock Holmes.[4]:\\u200a230\\u200a By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt he was \"an egocentric creep\".[111] Thompson believes Christie\\'s occasional antipathy to her creation is overstated, and points out that \"in later life she sought to protect him against misrepresentation as powerfully as if he were her own flesh and blood\".[14]:\\u200a282\\u200a Unlike Doyle, she resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular.[4]:\\u200a222\\u200a She married off Poirot\\'s \"Watson\", Captain Arthur Hastings, in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.[12]:\\u200a268\\u200a\\nMiss Jane Marple was introduced in a series of short stories that began publication in December 1927 and were subsequently collected under the title The Thirteen Problems.[14]:\\u200a278\\u200a Marple was a genteel, elderly spinster who solved crimes using analogies to English village life.[30]:\\u200a47,\\u200a74–76\\u200a Christie said, \"Miss Marple was not in any way a picture of my grandmother; she was far more fussy and spinsterish than my grandmother ever was\", but her autobiography establishes a firm connection between the fictional character and Christie\\'s step-grandmother Margaret Miller (\"Auntie-Grannie\")[i] and her \"Ealing cronies\".[12]:\\u200a422–23\\u200a[112] Both Marple and Miller \"always expected the worst of everyone and everything, and were, with almost frightening accuracy, usually proved right\".[12]:\\u200a422\\u200a Marple appeared in 12 novels and 20 stories.\\nDuring the Second World War, Christie wrote two novels, Curtain and Sleeping Murder, featuring Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, respectively. Both books were sealed in a bank vault, and she made over the copyrights by deed of gift to her daughter and her husband to provide each with a kind of insurance policy.[14]:\\u200a344\\u200a[30]:\\u200a190\\u200a Christie had a heart attack and a serious fall in 1974, after which she was unable to write.[4]:\\u200a372\\u200a Her daughter authorised the publication of Curtain in 1975,[4]:\\u200a375\\u200a and Sleeping Murder was published posthumously in 1976.[30]:\\u200a376\\u200a These publications followed the success of the 1974 film version of Murder on the Orient Express.[12]:\\u200a497\\u200a[113]\\nShortly before the publication of Curtain, Poirot became the first fictional character to have an obituary in The New York Times, which was printed on page one on 6 August 1975.[114][115]\\nChristie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple.[30]:\\u200a375\\u200a In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot\\xa0– a professional sleuth\\xa0– would not be at home at all in Miss Marple\\'s world.\"[112]\\nIn 2013, the Christie family supported the release of a new Poirot story, The Monogram Murders, written by British author Sophie Hannah.[116] Hannah later published three more Poirot mysteries, Closed Casket in 2016, The Mystery of Three Quarters in 2018.,[117][118] and The Killings at Kingfisher Hill in 2020.\\nChristie has been called the \"Duchess of Death\", the \"Mistress of Mystery\", and the \"Queen of Crime\".[31]:\\u200a15\\u200a Early in her career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new.\"[36] According to Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering \\'How can this be happening?\\' Then, slowly, she reveals how the impossible is not only possible but the only thing that could have happened.\"[117]\\nChristie developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the \"Golden Age\" of detective fiction.[119] Author Dilys Winn called Christie \"the doyenne of Coziness\", a sub-genre which \"featured a small village setting, a hero with faintly aristocratic family connections, a plethora of red herrings and a tendency to commit homicide with sterling silver letter openers and poisons imported from Paraguay\".[120] At the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of their deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party; but there are exceptions where it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as And Then There Were None and Endless Night).[121][122]\\nChristie did not limit herself to quaint English villages\\xa0– the action might take place on a small island (And Then There Were None), an aeroplane (Death in the Clouds), a train (Murder on the Orient Express), a steamship (Death on the Nile), a smart London flat (Cards on the Table), a resort in the West Indies (A Caribbean Mystery), or an archaeological dig (Murder in Mesopotamia)\\xa0– but the circle of potential suspects is usually closed and intimate: family members, friends, servants, business associates, fellow travellers.[123]:\\u200a37\\u200a Stereotyped characters abound (the femme fatale, the stolid policeman, the devoted servant, the dull colonel), but these may be subverted to stymie the reader; impersonations and secret alliances are always possible.[123]:\\u200a58\\u200a There is always a motive\\xa0– most often, money: \"There are very few killers in Christie who enjoy murder for its own sake.\"[14]:\\u200a379,\\u200a396\\u200a\\nProfessor of Pharmacology Michael C. Gerald noted that \"in over half her novels, one or more victims are poisoned, albeit not always to the full satisfaction of the perpetrator.\"[124]:\\u200aviii\\u200a Guns, knives, garrottes, tripwires, blunt instruments, and even a hatchet were also used, but \"Christie never resorted to elaborate mechanical or scientific means to explain her ingenuity,\"[125]:\\u200a57\\u200a according to John Curran, author and literary adviser to the Christie estate.[126] Many of her clues are mundane objects: a calendar, a coffee cup, wax flowers, a beer bottle, a fireplace used during a heat wave.[123]:\\u200a38\\u200a\\nAccording to crime writer P. D. James, Christie was prone to making the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Alert readers could sometimes identify the culprit by identifying the least likely suspect.[127] Christie mocked this insight in her foreword to Cards on the Table: \"Spot the person least likely to have committed the crime and in nine times out of ten your task is finished. Since I do not want my faithful readers to fling away this book in disgust, I prefer to warn them beforehand that this is not that kind of book.\"[128]:\\u200a135–36\\u200a\\nOn BBC Radio 4\\'s Desert Island Discs in 2007, Brian Aldiss said Christie had told him she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to \"frame\" that person.[129] Based upon a study of her working notebooks, Curran describes how Christie would first create a cast of characters, choose a setting, and then produce a list of scenes in which specific clues would be revealed; the order of scenes would be revised as she developed her plot. Of necessity, the murderer had to be known to the author before the sequence could be finalised and she began to type or dictate the first draft of her novel.[123] Much of the work, particularly dialogue, was done in her head before she put it on paper.[12]:\\u200a241–45\\u200a[128]:\\u200a33\\u200a\\nIn 2013, the 600 members of the Crime Writers\\' Association chose The Murder of Roger Ackroyd as \"the best whodunit\\xa0... ever written\".[130] Author Julian Symons observed, \"In an obvious sense, the book fits within the conventions\\xa0... The setting is a village deep within the English countryside, Roger Ackroyd dies in his study; there is a butler who behaves suspiciously\\xa0... Every successful detective story in this period involved a deceit practised upon the reader, and here the trick is the highly original one of making the murderer the local doctor, who tells the story and acts as Poirot\\'s Watson.\"[119]:\\u200a106–07\\u200a Critic Sutherland Scott stated, \"If Agatha Christie had made no other contribution to the literature of detective fiction she would still deserve our grateful thanks\" for writing this novel.[131]\\nIn September 2015, to mark her 125th birthday, And Then There Were None was named the \"World\\'s Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author\\'s estate.[132] The novel is emblematic of both her use of formula and her willingness to discard it. \"And Then There Were None carries the \\'closed society\\' type of murder mystery to extreme lengths,\" according to author Charles Osborne.[30]:\\u200a170\\u200a It begins with the classic set-up of potential victim(s) and killer(s) isolated from the outside world, but then violates conventions. There is no detective involved in the action, no interviews of suspects, no careful search for clues, and no suspects gathered together in the last chapter to be confronted with the solution. As Christie herself said, \"Ten people had to die without it becoming ridiculous or the murderer being obvious.\"[12]:\\u200a457\\u200a Critics agreed she had succeeded: \"The arrogant Mrs. Christie this time set herself a fearsome test of her own ingenuity\\xa0... the reviews, not surprisingly, were without exception wildly adulatory.\"[30]:\\u200a170–71\\u200a\\nChristie included stereotyped descriptions of characters in her work, especially before 1945 (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.[4]:\\u200a264–66\\u200a For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection The Mysterious Mr Quin. In 1947, the Anti-Defamation League in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie\\'s American publishers, Dodd, Mead and Company, regarding perceived antisemitism in her works. Christie\\'s British literary agent later wrote to her US representative, authorising American publishers to \"omit the word \\'Jew\\' when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books.\"[14]:\\u200a386\\u200a\\nIn The Hollow, published in 1946, one of the characters is described by another as \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a corncrake\\xa0... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some \"foreign\" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (Hallowe\\'en Party) and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in Three Act Tragedy), but they are rarely the culprits.[133]\\nIn 2023, the Telegraph reported that several Agatha Christie novels have been edited to remove potentially offensive language, including insults and references to ethnicity. Poirot and Miss Marple mysteries written between 1920 and 1976 have had passages reworked or removed in new editions published by HarperCollins, in order to strip them of language and descriptions that modern audiences find offensive, especially those involving the characters Christie’s protagonists encounter outside the UK. Sensitivity readers had made the edits, which were evident in digital versions of the new editions, including the entire Miss Marple run and selected Poirot novels set to be released or that have been released since 2020.[134]\\nIn addition to Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, Christie also created amateur detectives Thomas (Tommy) Beresford and his wife, Prudence \"Tuppence\" née Cowley, who appear in four novels and one collection of short stories published between 1922 and 1974. Unlike her other sleuths, the Beresfords were only in their early twenties when introduced in The Secret Adversary, and were allowed to age alongside their creator.[30]:\\u200a19–20\\u200a She treated their stories with a lighter touch, giving them a \"dash and verve\" which was not universally admired by critics.[31]:\\u200a63\\u200a Their last adventure, Postern of Fate, was Christie\\'s last novel.[14]:\\u200a477\\u200a\\nHarley Quin was \"easily the most unorthodox\" of Christie\\'s fictional detectives.[31]:\\u200a70\\u200a Inspired by Christie\\'s affection for the figures from the Harlequinade, the semi-supernatural Quin always works with an elderly, conventional man called Satterthwaite. The pair appear in 14 short stories, 12 of which were collected in 1930 as The Mysterious Mr. Quin.[30]:\\u200a78,\\u200a80\\u200a[135] Mallowan described these tales as \"detection in a fanciful vein, touching on the fairy story, a natural product of Agatha\\'s peculiar imagination\".[30]:\\u200a80\\u200a Satterthwaite also appears in a novel, Three Act Tragedy, and a short story, \"Dead Man\\'s Mirror\", both of which feature Poirot.[30]:\\u200a81\\u200a\\nAnother of her lesser-known characters is Parker Pyne, a retired civil servant who assists unhappy people in an unconventional manner.[30]:\\u200a118–19\\u200a The 12 short stories which introduced him, Parker Pyne Investigates (1934), are best remembered for \"The Case of the Discontented Soldier\", which features Ariadne Oliver, \"an amusing and satirical self-portrait of Agatha Christie\". Over the ensuing decades, Oliver reappeared in seven novels. In most of them she assists Poirot.[30]:\\u200a120\\u200a\\nIn 1928, Michael Morton adapted The Murder of Roger Ackroyd for the stage under the name of Alibi.[4]:\\u200a177\\u200a The play enjoyed a respectable run, but Christie disliked the changes made to her work and, in future, preferred to write for the theatre herself. The first of her own stage works was Black Coffee, which received good reviews when it opened in the West End in late 1930.[137] She followed this up with adaptations of her detective novels: And Then There Were None in 1943, Appointment with Death in 1945, and The Hollow in 1951.[4]:\\u200a242,\\u200a251,\\u200a288\\u200a\\nIn the 1950s, \"the theatre\\xa0... engaged much of Agatha\\'s attention.\"[138] She next adapted her short radio play into The Mousetrap, which premiered in the West End in 1952, produced by Peter Saunders and starring Richard Attenborough as the original Detective Sergeant Trotter.[136] Her expectations for the play were not high; she believed it would run no more than eight months.[12]:\\u200a500\\u200a The Mousetrap has long since made theatrical history as the world\\'s longest-running play, staging its 27,500th performance in September 2018.[136][139][140][141] The play temporarily closed in March 2020, when all UK theatres shut due to the coronavirus pandemic,[142][143] before it re-opened on 17 May 2021.[144]\\nIn 1953, she followed this with Witness for the Prosecution, whose Broadway production won the New York Drama Critics\\' Circle award for best foreign play of 1954 and earned Christie an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America.[4]:\\u200a300\\u200a[125]:\\u200a262\\u200a Spider\\'s Web, an original work written for actress Margaret Lockwood at her request, premiered in the West End in 1954 and was also a hit.[4]:\\u200a297,\\u200a300\\u200a Christie became the first female playwright to have three plays running simultaneously in London: The Mousetrap, Witness for the Prosecution and Spider\\'s Web.[145] She said, \"Plays are much easier to write than books, because you can see them in your mind\\'s eye, you are not hampered by all that description which clogs you so terribly in a book and stops you from getting on with what\\'s happening.\"[12]:\\u200a459\\u200a In a letter to her daughter, Christie said being a playwright was \"a lot of fun!\"[14]:\\u200a474\\u200a\\nChristie published six mainstream novels under the name Mary Westmacott, a pseudonym which gave her the freedom to explore \"her most private and precious imaginative garden\".[14]:\\u200a366–67\\u200a[30]:\\u200a87–88\\u200a These books typically received better reviews than her detective and thriller fiction.[14]:\\u200a366\\u200a Of the first, Giant\\'s Bread published in 1930, a reviewer for The New York Times wrote, \"...\\xa0her book is far above the average of current fiction, in fact, comes well under the classification of a \\'good book\\'. And it is only a satisfying novel that can claim that appellation.\"[146] It was publicized from the very beginning that \"Mary Westmacott\" was a pen name of a well-known author, although the identity behind the pen name was kept secret; the dust jacket of Giant\\'s Bread mentions that the author had previously written \"under her real name...half a dozen books that have each passed the thirty thousand mark in sales.\"  (In fact, though this was technically true, it disguised Christie\\'s identity through understatement.  By the publication of Giant\\'s Bread, Christie had published 10 novels and two short story collections, all of which had sold considerably more than 30,000 copies.)  After Christie\\'s authorship of the first four Westmacott novels was revealed by a journalist in 1949, she wrote two more, the last in 1956.[14]:\\u200a366\\u200a\\nThe other Westmacott titles are: Unfinished Portrait (1934), Absent in the Spring (1944), The Rose and the Yew Tree (1948), A Daughter\\'s a Daughter (1952), and The Burden (1956).\\nChristie published a few non-fiction works. Come, Tell Me How You Live, about working on an archaeological dig, was drawn from her life with Mallowan. The Grand Tour: Around the World with the Queen of Mystery is a collection of correspondence from her 1922 Grand Tour of the British Empire, including South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Agatha Christie: An Autobiography was published posthumously in 1977 and adjudged the Best Critical/Biographical Work at the 1978 Edgar Awards.[147]\\nMany of Christie\\'s works from 1940 onward have titles drawn from literature, with the original context of the title typically printed as an epigraph.[148]\\nThe inspirations for some of Christie\\'s titles include:\\nChristie biographer Gillian Gill said, \"Christie\\'s writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie\\'s novels succeed.\"[128]:\\u200a208\\u200a Reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror, numerous Christie titles were drawn from well-known children\\'s nursery rhymes: And Then There Were None (from \"Ten Little Niggers\", a rhyme also published as \"Ten Little Indians\", both of which were also used for the book\\'s title in some printings),[149] One, Two, Buckle My Shoe (from \"One, Two, Buckle My Shoe\"), Five Little Pigs (from \"This Little Piggy\"), Crooked House (from \"There Was a Crooked Man\"), A Pocket Full of Rye (from \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\"), Hickory Dickory Dock (from \"Hickory Dickory Dock\"), and Three Blind Mice (from \"Three Blind Mice\").[128]:\\u200a207–08\\u200a\\nChristie is regularly referred to as the \"Queen of Crime\"—which is now trademarked by the Christie estate—or \"Queen of Mystery\", and is considered a master of suspense, plotting, and characterisation.[150][151][152][153] In 1955, she became the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America\\'s Grand Master Award.[147] She was named \"Best Writer of the Century\" and the Hercule Poirot series of books was named \"Best Series of the Century\" at the 2000 Bouchercon World Mystery Convention.[154] In 2013, she was voted \"best crime writer\" in a survey of 600 members of the Crime Writers\\' Association of professional novelists.[130] However, the writer Raymond Chandler criticised the artificiality of her books, as did writer Julian Symons.[155][119]:\\u200a100–30\\u200a The literary critic Edmund Wilson described her prose as banal and her characterisations as superficial.[156][j]\\n\"With Christie\\xa0... we are dealing not so much with a literary figure as with a broad cultural phenomenon, like Barbie or the Beatles.\"\\n—Joan Acocella writing in The New Yorker[159]\\nIn 2011, Christie was named by the digital crime drama TV channel Alibi as the second most financially successful crime writer of all time in the United Kingdom, after James Bond author Ian Fleming, with total earnings around £100\\xa0million.[160] In 2012, Christie was among the people selected by the artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous work, the Beatles\\' Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover, \"to celebrate the British cultural figures he most admires\".[161][162] On the record-breaking longevity of Christie\\'s The Mousetrap which had marked its 60th anniversary in 2012, Stephen Moss in The Guardian wrote, \"the play and its author are the stars\".[136]\\nIn 2015, marking the 125th anniversary of her birth date, 25 contemporary mystery writers and one publisher gave their views on Christie\\'s works. Many of the authors had read Christie\\'s novels first, before other mystery writers, in English or in their native language, influencing their own writing, and nearly all still viewed her as the \"Queen of Crime\" and creator of the plot twists used by mystery authors. Nearly all had one or more favourites among Christie\\'s mysteries and found her books still good to read nearly 100 years after her first novel was published. Just one of the 25 authors held with Wilson\\'s views.[163]\\nIn her prime, Christie was rarely out of the bestseller list.[164] She was the first crime writer to have 100,000 copies of 10 of her titles published by Penguin on the same day in 1948.[165][166] As of 2018[update], Guinness World Records listed Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time.[167] As of 2020[update], her novels had sold more than two billion copies in 44 languages.[167] Half the sales are of English-language editions, and half are translations.[168][169] According to Index Translationum, as of 2020[update], she was the most-translated individual author.[170][171]\\nChristie is one of the most-borrowed authors in UK libraries.[172][173][174][175] She is also the UK\\'s best-selling spoken-book author. In 2002, 117,696 Christie audiobooks were sold, in comparison to 97,755 for J. K. Rowling, 78,770 for Roald Dahl and 75,841 for J. R. R. Tolkien.[176][177] In 2015, the Christie estate claimed And Then There Were None was \"the best-selling crime novel of all time\",[178] with approximately 100 million sales, also making it one of the highest-selling books of all time.[132][179] More than two million copies of her books were sold in English in 2020.[180]\\nIn 2016, the Royal Mail marked the centenary of Christie\\'s first detective story by issuing six first-class postage stamps of her works: The Mysterious Affair at Styles, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Murder on the Orient Express, And Then There Were None, The Body in the Library, and A Murder is Announced. The Guardian reported that, \"Each design incorporates microtext, UV ink and thermochromic ink. These concealed clues can be revealed using either a magnifying glass, UV light or body heat and provide pointers to the mysteries\\' solutions.\"[181][182]\\nHer characters and her face appeared on the stamps of many countries like Dominica and the Somali Republic.[183] In 2020, Christie was commemorated on a £2 coin by the Royal Mint for the first time to mark the centenary of her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles.[184]\\nIn 2023 a life-size bronze statue of Christie sitting on a park bench holding a book was unveiled in Wallingford.[185]\\nChristie\\'s works have been adapted for cinema and television. The first was the 1928 British film The Passing of Mr. Quin. Poirot\\'s first film appearance was in 1931 in Alibi, which starred Austin Trevor as Christie\\'s sleuth.[186]:\\u200a14–18\\u200a Margaret Rutherford played Marple in a series of films released in the 1960s. Christie liked her acting, but considered the first film \"pretty poor\" and thought no better of the rest.[14]:\\u200a430–31\\u200a\\nShe felt differently about the 1974 film Murder on the Orient Express, directed by Sidney Lumet, which featured major stars and high production values; her attendance at the London premiere was one of her last public outings.[14]:\\u200a476,\\u200a482\\u200a[186]:\\u200a57\\u200a In 2017, a new film version was released, directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also starred, wearing \"the most extravagant mustache moviegoers have ever seen\".[187] Branagh has since directed two more adaptations of Christie, Death on the Nile (2022) and its sequel A Haunting in Venice (2023), the latter an adaptation of her 1969 novel Hallowe\\'en Party.[188][189]\\nThe television adaptation Agatha Christie\\'s Poirot (1989–2013), with David Suchet in the title role, ran for 70 episodes over 13 series. It received nine BAFTA award nominations and won four BAFTA awards in 1990–1992.[190] The television series Miss Marple (1984–1992), with Joan Hickson as \"the BBC\\'s peerless Miss Marple\", adapted all 12 Marple novels.[14]:\\u200a500\\u200a The French television series Les Petits Meurtres d\\'Agatha Christie (2009–2012, 2013–2020), adapted 36 of Christie\\'s stories.[191][192]\\nChristie\\'s books have also been adapted for BBC Radio, a video game series, and graphic novels.[193][194][195][196]\\nDuring the First World War, Christie took a break from nursing to train for the Apothecaries Hall Examination.[124]:\\u200axi\\u200a While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up to date at Torquay Hospital.[12]:\\u200a235,\\u200a470\\u200a\\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons\\xa0... These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories.\"[124]:\\u200aviii\\u200a There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists, and scientists, naïve or suspicious, in Christie\\'s cast of characters; featuring in Murder in Mesopotamia, Cards on the Table, The Pale Horse, and Mrs. McGinty\\'s Dead, among many others.[124]\\nGillian Gill notes that the murder method in Christie\\'s first detective novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, \"comes right out of Agatha Christie\\'s work in the hospital dispensary\".[128]:\\u200a34\\u200a In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don\\'t like messy deaths\\xa0... I\\'m more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"[197] With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under Ronald Knox\\'s \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".[125]:\\u200a58\\u200a Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, nicotine, thallium, and other substances were used to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades.[124]\\nThe lure of the past came up to grab me. To see a dagger slowly appearing, with its gold glint, through the sand was romantic. The carefulness of lifting pots and objects from the soil filled me with a longing to be an archaeologist myself.\\nAgatha Christie[12]:\\u200a364\\u200a\\nIn her youth, Christie showed little interest in antiquities.[14]:\\u200a68\\u200a After her marriage to Mallowan in 1930, she accompanied him on annual expeditions, spending three to four months at a time in Syria and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, Nineveh, Tell Arpachiyah, Chagar Bazar, Tell Brak, and Nimrud.[14]:\\u200a301,\\u200a304,\\u200a313,\\u200a414\\u200a The Mallowans also took side trips whilst travelling to and from expedition sites, visiting Italy, Greece, Egypt, Iran, and the Soviet Union, among other places.[4]:\\u200a188–91,\\u200a199,\\u200a212\\u200a[12]:\\u200a429–37\\u200a Their experiences travelling and living abroad are reflected in novels such as Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile, and Appointment with Death.[14]:\\u200a514 (n. 6)\\u200a[198]\\nFor the 1931 digging season at Nineveh, Christie bought a writing table to continue her own work; in the early 1950s, she paid to add a small writing room to the team\\'s house at Nimrud.[14]:\\u200a301\\u200a[30]:\\u200a244\\u200a She also devoted time and effort each season in \"making herself useful by photographing, cleaning, and recording finds; and restoring ceramics, which she especially enjoyed\".[199][31]:\\u200a20–21\\u200a She also provided funds for the expeditions.[14]:\\u200a414\\u200a\\nMany of the settings for Christie\\'s books were inspired by her archaeological fieldwork in the Middle East; this is reflected in the detail with which she describes them\\xa0– for instance, the temple of Abu Simbel as depicted in Death on the Nile\\xa0– while the settings for They Came to Baghdad were places she and Mallowan had recently stayed.[4]:\\u200a212,\\u200a283–84\\u200a Similarly, she drew upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig throughout Murder in Mesopotamia.[123]:\\u200a269\\u200a Archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts featured in her works include Dr Eric Leidner in Murder in Mesopotamia and Signor Richetti in Death on the Nile.[200]:\\u200a187,\\u200a226–27\\u200a\\nAfter the Second World War, Christie chronicled her time in Syria in Come, Tell Me How You Live, which she described as \"small beer\\xa0– a very little book, full of everyday doings and happenings\".[201]:\\u200a(Foreword)\\u200a From 8\\xa0November 2001 to March 2002, The British Museum presented a \"colourful and episodic exhibition\" called Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia which illustrated how her activities as a writer and as the wife of an archaeologist intertwined.[202]\\nSome of Christie\\'s fictional portrayals have explored and offered accounts of her disappearance in 1926. The film Agatha (1979), with Vanessa Redgrave, has Christie sneaking away to plan revenge against her husband; Christie\\'s heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film\\'s distribution.[203] The Doctor Who episode \"The Unicorn and the Wasp\" (17 May 2008) stars Fenella Woolgar as Christie, and explains her disappearance as being connected to aliens. The film Agatha and the Truth of Murder (2018) sends her undercover to solve the murder of Florence Nightingale\\'s goddaughter, Florence Nightingale Shore. A fictionalised account of Christie\\'s disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, Agatha.[204] The Christie Affair, a Christie-like mystery story of love and revenge by author Nina de Gramont, was a 2022 novel loosely based on Christie\\'s disappearance.[205]\\nOther portrayals, such as the Hungarian film Kojak Budapesten (1980), create their own scenarios involving Christie\\'s criminal skills. In the TV play Murder by the Book (1986), Christie (Dame Peggy Ashcroft) murders one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen\\'s Dorothy and Agatha and The London Blitz Murders by Max Allan Collins.[206][207] The American television program Unsolved Mysteries devoted a segment to her famous disappearance, with Agatha portrayed by actress Tessa Pritchard. A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series Gran Hotel (2011) in which she finds inspiration to write her new novel while aiding local detectives. In the alternative history television film Agatha and the Curse of Ishtar (2018), Christie becomes involved in a murder case at an archaeological dig in Iraq.[208] In 2019, Honeysuckle Weeks portrayed Christie in an episode, \"No Friends Like Old Friends\", in a Canadian drama, Frankie Drake Mysteries.\\nIn 2020, Heather Terrell, under the pseudonym of Marie Benedict, published The Mystery of Mrs. Christie, a fictional reconstruction of Christie\\'s December 1926 disappearance. The novel was on the USA Today and The New York Times Best Seller lists.[209][210] In December 2020, Library Reads named Terrell a Hall of Fame author for the book.[211]\\nAndrew Wilson has written four novels featuring Agatha Christie as a detective: A Talent For Murder (2017), A Different Kind of Evil (2018), Death In A Desert Land (2019) and I Saw Him Die (2020).[212] Christie was portrayed by Shirley Henderson in the 2022 comedy/mystery film See How They Run.[213][214]\\n',\n",

During college, she began re-typing her mother\\'s transcripts. She also made contributions such as renaming locations and characters.[3]  She was the only one of the five Clark siblings to become a writer. One thing that influenced this decision was helping her mother. While Mary Higgins Clark attempted juggling a full-time job and trying to finish her second book, the younger Higgins Clark grasped this opportunity to familiarize herself with the process of writing a book and telling tales, not knowing this would be her start in becoming a well-known author.[4] Just as her mother did, Clark wrote suspense books. One difference in the mother and daughter\\'s writings is that Clark\\'s books contain a slight sense of humor that her mother\\'s do not possess.[5] All of her novels feature Regan Reilly (a famous recurring character), plot points about male escorts, and pantyhose conventions that come from real sources.[6] In her video for NJN Public Television, Clark explains how she used her first job experience to help her with ideas about her book. In her book Iced, she uses a woman who is working at a dry cleaners. The woman uncovers evidence found in the pockets of a customer.\\nClark chose acting as her profession[7] and began to study acting after graduating from Mount Holyoke College. In 1975, she starred in \"Who Killed Amy Lang\", which aired on Good Morning America. She also performed in Wendy Wasserstein\\'s play \"Uncommon Women\". She played the lead in the film A Cry In The Night, based on a novel by her mother.[8]\\nIn 2001, Clark appeared as a contestant on the game show To Tell The Truth; three of the panelists correctly identified her.[9]\\nClark\\'s New York apartment building, The Belaire, was hit by a small plane on October 11, 2006 flown by New York Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle.[10] Her 38th floor condominium was just a floor below the main impact zone; she was not at home during the accident.[10]\\nOn June 12, 2023, Clark died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles of appendix cancer at the age of 66.[11]\\nClark\\'s début novel Decked was nominated for the 1992 Agatha Award and the 1993 Anthony Award for \"Best First Novel\".[12][13]\\n',\n",

His father was principal clerk- formerly secretary to the High Commissioner of India- in the India Office; of Irish birth, his family later settled at Hanwell, in the London Borough of Ealing. Montgomery\\'s mother was Scottish, of a family claiming illegitimate descent from Bonnie Prince Charlie. When Montgomery was two years old, his family moved round the corner to \"Domus\", a \"big house in a rural setting\" that was built according to his father\\'s instructions.[1][2]\\nHe was educated at Merchant Taylors\\' School and graduated from St John\\'s College, Oxford, in 1943, with a BA in modern languages, having for two years been its organ scholar[3] and choirmaster. While there he became friendly with Philip Larkin and Kingsley Amis.[4] From 1943 to 1945 he taught at Shrewsbury School and began writing the first of his detective novels. Montgomery encouraged Larkin\\'s writing ambitions, and according to Andrew Motion \"by combining a devoted commitment to writing with a huge appetite for drinking and fooling around, he gave Larkin a model of the ways in which art could avoid pretension\".[5]\\nHe first became established under his own name as a composer of vocal and choral music, including An Oxford Requiem (1951), but later turned to film work, writing the scores for many British comedies of the 1950s. For the Carry On series he composed six scores (Sergeant, Nurse, Teacher, Constable, Regardless and Cruising), including the original Carry On theme subsequently adapted for later films by Eric Rogers. He also composed the scores to four films in the Doctor film series (House, Sea, Large and Love). Montgomery wrote both the screenplay and score of Raising the Wind (1961), and his other film scores included The Kidnappers (1953), Raising a Riot (1955), Eyewitness (1956), The Truth About Women (1957), The Surgeon\\'s Knife (1957), Please Turn Over (1959), Too Young to Love (1959), Watch Your Stern (1960), No Kidding (1960), Twice Round the Daffodils (1962) and The Brides of Fu Manchu (1966).\\nMontgomery wrote detective novels and two collections of short stories under the pseudonym Edmund Crispin (taken from a character in Michael Innes\\'s Hamlet, Revenge!).[6] Nine volumes appeared between 1944 and 1953, starting with The Case of The Gilded Fly. The stories feature Oxford don Gervase Fen,[7] who is a professor of English at the university and a fellow of St Christopher\\'s College, a fictional institution that Crispin locates next to St John\\'s College. Fen is an eccentric, sometimes absent-minded, character reportedly based on his tutor, the Oxford professor W. G. Moore (1905-1978).[8] The whodunit novels have complex plots and fantastic, somewhat unbelievable solutions, including examples of the locked room mystery. They are written in a humorous, literary and sometimes farcical style. They are also among the few mystery novels to break the fourth wall occasionally and speak directly to the audience. Perhaps the best example is from The Moving Toyshop, during a chase sequence\\xa0– \"Let\\'s go left\", Cadogan suggested.  \"After all, Gollancz is publishing this book.\"[9]\\nAll of the novels contain frequent references to English literature, poetry, and (in particular) music. Frequent Hearses and Swan Song have a specifically musical backdrop. Swan Song (1947) explores the world of opera during rehearsals for a production of Wagner\\'s Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, while Frequent Hearses is set in a film studio, and includes among the characters Napier, a composer of film music. By 1950, when Frequent Hearses was published, Montgomery was already busy elsewhere, also establishing himself as a composer of film music.\\nCrispin is considered by many to be one of the last great exponents of the classic crime mystery.[10]\\nBruce Montgomery composed the scores for nearly forty films, including documentaries and thrillers. The Carry-On Suite, arranged by David Whittle from the scores of Carry On Sergeant (1958), Carry On Nurse (1959) and Carry On Teacher (1959), provides a representative example, dominated by the main theme, a comedy March. For Raising the Wind (1961), Montgomery was responsible for the storyline, screenplay and musical score, also conducting the music and acting as technical advisor.[11]\\nAlthough his film work got his music out to a huge audience, the numerous comedy scores in particular stand in stark contrast to Bruce Montgomery\\'s concert works and church music with which he started out. These began to appear in the mid-1940s, at the same time his detective novels were appearing under the name Edmund Crispin. An early example is the Overture to a Fairy Tale of 1946, first performed in February 1948 by the Torquay Municipal Orchestra. (Montgomery was living at Brixham at the time).[12]\\nBut church music predominates, the culmination being the Oxford Requiem, commissioned by the Oxford Bach Choir and first performed at the Sheldonian Theatre on 23 May 1951 (The Sheldonian was also the scene of a crime in his novel The Moving Toyshop). He may have been motivated to compose the piece following the death of his close friend and teacher, the organist and composer Godfrey Sampson – thought also to have been the inspiration behind the character Geoffrey Vintner, the organist and friend of Gervase Fen in Holy Disorders. An Oxford Requiem \"is Montgomery’s most considerable achievement to date\", wrote The Times reviewer, \"and confirms the suspicion that he is a real composer with something of real significance to say\".[13] The choir of St John\\'s College, Oxford has recorded the final movement, \\'Lord, thou hast been our refuge\\'.[14] The Requiem was followed by his final major work for chorus, the secular Venus\\' Praise, a setting of seven sixteenth and seventeenth century English poems.[15]\\nEven less known are the operas, which include a children\\'s ballad opera, John Barleycorn, and two intriguing collaborations with his friend Kingsley Amis providing the texts. The first, Amberley Hall, was described by Montgomery as \"a mildly scandalous burlesque set in England in the 18th century\". The second, To Move the Passions, was a ballad opera commissioned for the 1951 Festival of Britain. Both remained unfinished, and Amis complained that Montgomery was too busy \"writing filthy film scores and stinking stories for the popular press\".\\nOf the orchestral concert works, only Overture to a Fairy Tale and the Concertino for String Orchestra of 1950 – a substantial three movement piece despite the modest title, and the only purely instrumental work Montgomery ever had published – are generally available as recordings.[16] There are recordings of two concert works derived from film scores: Scottish Aubade (from the 1952 documentary film Scottish Highlands) and Scottish Lullaby (from The Kidnappers, 1953).[17]\\nPhilip Lane calls Montgomery \"a composer of talent who was perhaps side-tracked, and, not helped by increasing alcoholism, unable to fulfil his full potential. On the other hand, not every composer has their music heard by millions throughout the world, even though not every listener is aware of the composer’s name.\"[18]\\nMontgomery returned to literature at the end of his life, with the final Crispin novel, The Glimpses of the Moon (1977). By now, the composer character, Broderick Thouless, is writing \"difficult\" film music and light concert works rather than the other way round (as it was with Napier in Frequent Hearses). Such comic perversity is characteristic of Crispin.\\nBut Montgomery\\'s output of music and fiction had all but ceased after the 1950s, although he continued to write reviews of crime novels and science fiction works for The Sunday Times (praising the early works of both P. D. James and Ruth Rendell).[19] He had always been a heavy drinker, and there was a long gap in his writing during a time when he was suffering from alcohol problems. Otherwise he enjoyed a quiet life (enlivened by music, reading, church-going and bridge) in Totnes, Devon, where he resisted all attempts to develop or exploit the district, and visited London as little as possible. He moved to a new house he had built at Higher Week, a hamlet near Dartington, in 1964. The 1969 short story We Know You\\'re Busy Writing, But We Thought You Wouldn\\'t Mind If We Just Dropped in for a Minute humorously evokes the difficulties of a writer balancing his social and leisure inclinations with the discipline of writing.  In 1976 he married his secretary Ann, two years before he died from alcohol-related problems aged 56.\\nA biography by David Whittle, Bruce Montgomery/Edmund Crispin: A Life in Music and Books (ISBN\\xa00754634434) was published in June 2007. A previously unpublished novella, featuring Gervase Fen, \"The Hours of Darkness,\" has been included in the 2019 edition of the annual anthology, Bodies from the Library.[20]\\nGareth Roberts has said that the tone of his Doctor Who novel The Well-Mannered War was modelled upon Crispin\\'s style. He also remarks (of The Moving Toyshop): \"It\\'s more like Doctor Who than Doctor Who.\" Christopher Fowler pays homage to The Moving Toyshop in The Victoria Vanishes, his sixth Bryant & May novel.\\nAll feature Gervase Fen.\\nCrispin also edited two volumes entitled Best Detective Stories and seven entitled Best Science Fiction,[21] which were published during the 1950s and 1960s.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nBrian Brendon Talbot Cleeve (22 November 1921 – 11 March 2003) was a writer, whose published works include twenty-one novels and over a hundred short stories. He was also an award-winning broadcaster on RTÉ television. Son of an Irish father and English mother, he was born and raised in England. He lived in South Africa during the early years of National Party rule and was expelled from the country because of his opposition to apartheid. In his early thirties he moved to Ireland where he lived for the remainder of his life. In late middle age he underwent a profound spiritual experience, which led him to embrace mysticism. He developed a model for the spiritual life based on the principle of obedience to the will of God.\\nBrian Cleeve was born in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, the second of three sons to Charles Edward Cleeve and his wife Josephine (née Talbot).[1] Josephine was a native of Essex, where her family had lived for generations. Charles Cleeve, who was born in Limerick, Ireland, was a scion of a famous and wealthy family that ran several successful Irish enterprises in the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.[2] The Cleeves came from Canada originally and emigrated to Ireland in the mid-nineteenth century. As a result of labour troubles and the effects of the Irish Civil War, the Cleeve business failed and Charles moved with his family to England, where Brian was born in 1921.\\nWhen he was two-and-a-half, Brian\\'s mother died and his maternal grandparents, Alfred and Gertrude Talbot, took over responsibility for his upbringing. At age eight, Cleeve was sent as a boarder to Selwyn House in Kent, followed at age 12 by three years at St. Edward\\'s School in Oxford.[3] He was by nature a free-thinker and he rejected the assumptions and prejudices that were then part and parcel of upper-middle class English life. His unwillingness to conform meant that school life was very difficult for him, and, in the late summer of 1938, Cleeve decided not to return to St. Edward\\'s for his final year. Instead, he ran away to sea.\\nCleeve led an eventful life during the next fifteen years. He served on the RMS\\xa0Queen Mary as a commis waiter for several months.[3] At age 17 he joined the Queen\\'s Own Cameron Highlanders as a private soldier, and, because of his age, just missed being sent to Europe as part of the BEF when World War II broke out. In 1940, he was selected for officer training, was commissioned into the Somerset Light Infantry,[4] and sent to Kenya as a Second lieutenant in the King\\'s African Rifles.  A year later he was court-martialled as a result of his objections to the treatment by colleagues of an African prisoner.  Stripped of his commission and sentenced to three years\\' penal servitude, he was transferred to Wakefield Prison in Yorkshire. There, through the intervention of Sir Alexander Paterson, he was offered parole if he agreed to work for British Intelligence. For the remainder of the war he served as a counter-spy in neutral ports such as Lisbon and Dublin. As cover, he worked as an ordinary seaman in the Merchant Navy.[3]\\nIn 1945, Cleeve took an Irish passport and came to Ireland where, in the space of three weeks, he met and married Veronica McAdie. A year later, they left Ireland with baby daughter Berenice on a protracted odyssey that took them to London, Sweden, the West Indies, and finally South Africa. In 1948, the family \\nsettled in Johannesburg where Cleeve and his wife set up their own perfume business.  A second daughter, Tanga, was born to the couple there in 1953. As a result of his friendship with Fr. Trevor Huddleston, Cleeve witnessed the conditions in which the black and coloured population had to live in townships such as Sophiatown.  Cleeve became an outspoken critic of Apartheid, and, in 1954, he was branded by the authorities as a \\'political intractable\\' and ordered to leave South Africa. He returned to Ireland where he lived for the remainder of his life.[5]\\nCleeve started writing poems in his teens, a few of which were published in his school paper, the St. Edward\\'s Chronicle. During the war he continued to produce poems of a spiritual or metaphysical nature, most of which were never published.  In 1945, he turned to novel-writing. After his first two attempts were rejected, his third novel, The Far Hills, was published in 1952. It is a roman à clef about the first few months of his married life in Dublin. It is also an unflattering picture of the drabness and mean-spiritedness of lower middle class Irish life in the mid-1940s. Two further novels about South Africa followed and their unvarnished descriptions of the reality of life for the native population probably contributed to Cleeve\\'s eventual expulsion from the country.\\nIn the mid-1950s, Cleeve began to concentrate on the short story form. During the next 15 years over 100 of his short stories were published in magazines and periodicals across five continents. He sold nearly 30 to The Saturday Evening Post alone. In 1966, his story Foxer was honoured with a scroll at the annual Edgar Awards.[6]\\nDuring the 1960s and 70s, Cleeve returned to writing novels with considerable success. He produced a series of well-received mystery and spy thrillers that did not sacrifice character to plot.  One of these, Dark Blood, Dark Terror, was reviewed in the following terms by The Sunday Express: \"Dublin author\\'s exciting novel overshadows a man of genius. I am afraid Graham Greene comes off second best\". (This was a reference to Greene\\'s The Comedians.)\\nIn 1971, Cleeve published Cry of Morning, his most controversial and successful novel up to that point. It is a panoramic depiction of the economic and social changes that affected Ireland during the 1960s as seen through the eyes of a disparate collection of well-drawn characters. Cleeve subsequently achieved even greater commercial success, especially in the United States, with a number of historical novels featuring a strong female character as protagonist.  The first of these, Sara, is set in England during the Napoleonic era and was published in 1975.[7]\\nCleeve also wrote several works of non-fiction, principally the Dictionary of Irish Writers. This was a 20-year project to provide to scholars and the general public alike a comprehensive resource on Irish writers at an affordable price.  It was a labour of love that consumed a great deal of his time and was effectively subsidised by \\nhis more commercial pursuits.  The last edition was published in 1985.[3]\\nOn 31 December 1961, Telefís Éireann was launched as the Republic of Ireland\\'s first indigenous television station. Cleeve joined the station as a part-time interviewer on the current affairs programme, Broadsheet. In 1964, a new documentary series, Discovery, began with Cleeve as scriptwriter and presenter. The series covered all aspects of Irish life and Cleeve won a Jacobs\\' Award for his contribution.[8]\\nIn January 1966, Telefís Éireann announced that Cleeve was being dropped as presenter of Discovery because his voice was deemed to be \"too light in tone\". Many suspected that the real reason was political. Cleeve was told by a colleague that his English accent was felt to be similar to that of the \"ascendancy class\".  This was a reference to the Protestant Ascendancy elite which had governed Ireland up to 1800.  An evening newspaper mounted a campaign on Cleeve\\'s behalf and he was soon reinstated.[9]\\nIn September 1966, he joined the new weekly current affairs programme, 7 Days.  There, Cleeve and his colleagues set about exposing issues of public interest, much to the dismay of the traditional power structures of big business, the Catholic Church and the political parties.  Eventually, external pressure led to the programme coming under tighter editorial control.  Cleeve refused to be subject to the new regime and was moved to other less controversial programmes.[10]  Telefís Éireann did not renew his contract when it expired in 1973, ironically, just as his last documentary won two awards at the Golden Prague International Television Festival. The documentary, Behind The Closed Eye, focused on the Irish poet Francis Ledwidge who was killed while serving \\nin the British army in Belgium during World War I.[11]\\nIn addition to his literary and broadcasting careers, Cleeve had a lively interest in many other areas.  \\nRaised as an Anglican, Cleeve converted to Roman Catholicism in 1942.[3] In his thirties he became agnostic but continued to pursue his interest in the spiritual dimension of life.  In 1977, he began to experience a deep sense of the presence of God and the effect on his life was profound.  He all but abandoned his successful literary career and wrote three mystical works that aroused much debate in Ireland.[12] The first of these, The House on the Rock, contains a series of meditations on a wide variety of topics from the nature of good and evil to more secular matters such as politics and nuclear energy.  This was followed by The Seven Mansions, which delves deeper into some of the subjects covered in its predecessor. The third book, The Fourth Mary, was published in 1982 and is an account of a branch of the cult of Dionysus that flourished in first century Jerusalem.\\nWhen the clamour caused by his spiritual books died down, Cleeve withdrew from the public gaze.  He continued to write for a small audience of those who contacted him following publication of The House on the Rock.  In 2001, he published a collection of essays on the Internet summarising his spiritual beliefs.  In these, he described the steps he believed were necessary for anyone wishing to pursue a spiritual life.  They consist of learning to follow God\\'s guidance as an \"inner voice\" in one\\'s mind, uncovering the past failures that keep one trapped in a negative cycle of self-absorption, and learning the qualities necessary to live as one of God\\'s servants.[1]\\nFollowing his wife Veronica\\'s death in 1999, Cleeve moved to the village of Shankill, Dublin.  His health deteriorated rapidly following a series of small strokes.  In November 2001, he married his second wife, Patricia Ledwidge, and she cared for him during his final months.\\nOn 11 March 2003, he died suddenly of a heart attack and his body now lies under a headstone bearing the inscription, \\'Servant of God\\'.\\n',\n",

He was a recipient of the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America (MWA), the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Private Eye Writers of America and the Marlowe Lifetime Achievement Award from MWA, Southern California Chapter.\\nLynds was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the only child of actors who were touring at the time.  He grew up in New York City and fought in Europe during World War II, earning a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He studied chemistry (Bachelor\\'s degree in 1949) and journalism (Master\\'s degree in 1951). After working as a magazine editor in New York, he moved to California in 1965 to write full-time.  Married to thriller author Gayle Lynds, he lived in California until his death.\\nWritten under the \"Michael Collins\" pen name, his Dan Fortune stories constitute one of the longest-running private detective series written, beginning in 1967 with Act of Fear, which earned a 1968 Edgar Award, for Best First Novel. As Collins, Lynds is largely credited with bringing the detective novel into the modern age:  \\n\"After naming Lynds the Best Suspense writer of the 1970s\", Baker and Nietzel continue, the Crime Literature Association of West Germany praised him as follows:\\nBaker and Nietzel point out a popular phenomenon that began with Collins\\'s first book: \"Act of Fear ... inspired the by-now monotonous chant by critics about each new hard-boiled author being \\'the best since Hammett,\\' \\'the new Chandler,\\' and \\'the heir to Ross Macdonald.\\' Fortune enjoys a senior status among modern private eyes\", predating Lawrence Block, Robert Parker, Elmore Leonard, Joseph Hansen, Joe Gores, Michael Lewin, and Bill Pronzini.\\nAs Michael Collins, he also wrote two science fiction novels, Lukan War in 1969, and its sequel, The Planets of Death, in 1970. Both novels are about mercenaries in a future where they are despised and reviled by most people.  When suddenly the society is attacked by a very dangerous enemy, they are called upon to fight and die to protect the same people who were treating them so badly not long before.\\nBeginning in 1968 with The Mystery of the Moaning Cave and ending in 1989 with Hot Wheels, Lynds wrote fourteen novels under the pen name William Arden for the juvenile detective series The Three Investigators, which was originated by Robert Arthur, Jr.  Under this same name, he also wrote five novels featuring private eye Kane Jackson, a former military policeman who has become an industrial security specialist after leaving the military.  The first Jackson novel, A Dark Power, appeared in 1968.  As Arden, Lynds also wrote the highly regarded espionage short story \"Success of a Mission,\" which was a finalist for the 1968 Edgar Award for best short fiction.\\nProlific, explaining that he had more ideas than he knew what to do with, in addition to his Collins name, he created additional series under the pseudonyms Mark Sadler, John Crowe, and Carl Dekker.

       " 'Michael Joseph Connelly (born July 21, 1956[1]) is an American author of detective novels and other crime fiction, notably those featuring LAPD Detective Hieronymus \"Harry\" Bosch and criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller. \\nConnelly is the bestselling author of 38 novels and one work of non-fiction, with over 74 million copies of his books sold worldwide and translated into 40 languages. His first novel, The Black Echo, won the   Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award for Best First Novel in 1992. In 2002, Clint Eastwood directed and starred in the movie adaptation of Connelly\\'s 1997 novel, Blood Work. In March 2011, the movie adaptation of Connelly\\'s novel The Lincoln Lawyer starred Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Haller.[2] Connelly was the President of the Mystery Writers of America from 2003 to 2004.[3]\\nConnelly was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the second eldest child of W. Michael Connelly, a property developer, and Mary Connelly, a homemaker.[4] He is of Irish ancestry.[5] According to Connelly, his father was a frustrated artist who encouraged his children to want to succeed in life[6] and was a risk taker who alternated between success and failure in his pursuit of a career. Connelly\\'s mother was a fan of crime fiction and introduced her son to the world of mystery novels.[4]\\nAt age 12, Connelly moved with his family from Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where he attended St. Thomas Aquinas High School. At age 16, Connelly\\'s interest in crime and mystery escalated when, on his way home from his work as a hotel dishwasher, he witnessed a man throw an object into a hedge. Connelly decided to investigate and found that the object was a gun wrapped in a lumberjack shirt. After putting the gun back, he followed the man to a bar and then left to go home to tell his father. Later that night, Connelly brought the police down to the bar, but the man was already gone. This event introduced Connelly to the world of police officers and their lives, impressing him with the way they worked.[4]\\nConnelly had planned on following his father\\'s early choice of career in building construction and started out at the University of Florida in Gainesville, at the Rinker School of Building Construction, studying construction management. After earning grades that were lower than expected, Connelly went to see Robert Altman\\'s film The Long Goodbye (1973). The film, based on Raymond Chandler\\'s eponymous 1953 novel, inspired Connelly to want to become a mystery writer. Connelly went home and read all of Chandler\\'s works featuring Philip Marlowe, and decided to transfer to the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications, major in journalism, and minor in creative writing.[4]\\nAfter graduating from the University of Florida in 1980, Connelly got a job as a crime beat writer at the Daytona Beach News Journal, where he worked for almost two years until he went to the Fort Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel in 1981. There, he covered the crime beat during the South Florida cocaine wars.[3] He stayed with the paper for a few years and in 1986, he and two other reporters spent several months interviewing survivors of the 1985 Delta Flight 191 plane crash, which story earned Connelly a place as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.[7]  The honor also brought Connelly a job as a crime reporter at the Los Angeles Times. He moved to California in 1987 with his wife Linda McCaleb, whom he met while in college and married in April 1984.[4]\\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, Connelly went to see High Tower Court[8] where Raymond Chandler\\'s character Philip Marlowe had lived (in his 1942 novel The High Window), and Robert Altman had used for his film The Long Goodbye (1973). Connelly got the manager of the building to promise to phone him if the apartment ever became available. Ten years later, the manager tracked Connelly down, and Connelly decided to rent the place. This apartment served as a place to write for several years.[6][9]\\nAfter three years at the Los Angeles Times, Connelly wrote his first published novel, The Black Echo (1992), after previously writing two unfinished novels that he did not attempt to get published.[6] He sold The Black Echo to Little, Brown to be published in 1992 and won the Mystery Writers of America\\'s Edgar Award for best first novel.[7] The book is partly based on a true crime and is the first one featuring Connelly\\'s primary recurring character, Los Angeles Police Department Detective Hieronymus \"Harry\" Bosch,[3] a man who, according to Connelly, shares few similarities with the author himself.[6] Connelly named Bosch after the Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch, known for his paintings full of sin and redemption, such as the painting Hell, a copy of which hangs on the office wall behind Connelly\\'s computer.[2][4] Connelly describes his own work as a big canvas with all the characters of his books floating across it as currents on a painting. Sometimes they are bound to collide, creating cross currents. This is something that Connelly creates by bringing back characters from previous books and letting them play a part in books written five or six years after first being introduced.[4]\\nConnelly went on to write three more novels about Detective Bosch—The Black Ice (1993), The Concrete Blonde (1994), and The Last Coyote (1995)—before quitting his job as a reporter to write full-time.[4]\\nMichael Connelly received a good deal of publicity in 1994, when President Bill Clinton came out of a bookstore carrying a copy of The Concrete Blonde in front of the waiting cameras. A meeting was set up between the two at Los Angeles International Airport.[4]\\nIn 1996, Connelly wrote The Poet, his first book not to feature Bosch, instead the protagonist was reporter Jack McEvoy. The book was a success.[4] In 1997, Connelly returned to Bosch in Trunk Music before writing another book, Blood Work (1997), about a different character, FBI agent Terry McCaleb. Blood Work was made into a film in 2002, directed by Clint Eastwood, who also played McCaleb,[4] an agent with a transplanted heart, in pursuit of his donor\\'s murderer. The book came together after one of Connelly\\'s friends had a heart transplant and he saw what his friend was going through with survivor\\'s guilt after the surgery.[3] When asked if he had anything against the changes made to fit the big screen, Connelly simply replied: \"If you take their money, it\\'s their turn to tell the story\".[10]\\nConnelly wrote another book featuring Bosch, Angels Flight (1999), before writing Void Moon (2000), a free-standing book about Las Vegas thief Cassie Black. In 2001, A Darkness More Than Night was published, in which Connelly united Bosch and McCaleb to solve a crime together, before releasing two books in 2002. The first, City of Bones, was the eighth Bosch novel, and the other, Chasing the Dime, was a non-series novel.[3] In 2001, Connelly left California for Tampa Bay, Florida, together with his wife and daughter, so that both he and his wife could be closer to their families. His novels still took place in Los Angeles.[6]\\nIn 2003, another Bosch novel, Lost Light, was published. With this book, a CD was released, Dark Sacred Night, the Music of Harry Bosch, featuring some of the jazz music that both Connelly and the fictional character Bosch listen to.[3] While writing Connelly listens exclusively to instrumental jazz, though, because it does not have intrusive vocals, and because the improvisational playing inspires his writing.[2] The Narrows, published in 2004, was a sequel to The Poet but featured Bosch instead of McEvoy.[3] Together with this book, a DVD was released called Blue Neon Night: Michael Connelly\\'s Los Angeles, in which film Connelly presents some of the places in Los Angeles that are frequently featured in his books.[3]\\nThe Closers, published in May 2005, was the 11th Bosch novel. It was followed by The Lincoln Lawyer in October, Connelly\\'s first legal novel; it features defense attorney Mickey Haller, Bosch\\'s half-brother. The book was made into a film in 2011, starring Matthew McConaughey as Haller. After releasing Crime Beat (2004),[11] a non-fiction book about Connelly\\'s experiences as a crime reporter, Connelly went back to Bosch with Echo Park (2006).[3] This book sets its opening scene in the High Tower Apartment that Connelly rented and wrote from.[6] His next Bosch story, The Overlook, was originally published as a multi-part series in the New York Times Magazine. After some editing, it was published as a novel in 2007. In October 2008, Connelly wrote The Brass Verdict, which brought together Bosch and Haller for the first time.[3]  He followed that with The Scarecrow (May 2009), which brought back McEvoy as the lead character. 9 Dragons, a novel taking Bosch to Hong Kong, was published in October 2009. The Reversal (October 2010), reunites Bosch & Haller as they work together under the banner of the state on the retrial of a child murderer. The Haller novel The Fifth Witness was published in 2011.\\nThe Drop, which refers in part to the \"Deferred Retirement Option Plan\" that was described in the novel The Brass Verdict (2008),[12] was published in November 2011. The next Bosch novel was The Black Box (2012). Connelly\\'s subsequent novel, a legal thriller, was a return to Haller: The Gods of Guilt (2013). His next book returned to Bosch in The Burning Room (2014), and then Connelly used Haller as a main supporting character in the Bosch novels The Crossing (2015) and The Wrong Side of Goodbye (2016).\\nConnelly has won nearly every major award given to mystery writers, including the Edgar Award,[18] Anthony Award,[19] Macavity Award,[20] Los Angeles Times Best Mystery/Thriller Award,[21] Shamus Award,[22] Dilys Award,[23] Nero Award,[24] Barry Award,[25] Audie Award,[26] Ridley Award, Maltese Falcon Award (Japan), .38 Caliber Award (France), the Grand Prix de Littérature Policière (France) and Premio Bancarella Award (Italy).[27] In 2012, The Black Box won the world\\'s most lucrative crime fiction award, the RBA Prize for Crime Writing worth €125,000.[28]\\nHe received the Cartier Diamond Dagger in 2018 from the Crime Writers\\' Association.[29]\\nWhen starting a book, he says, the story is not always clear, but Connelly has “a hunch” as to where it is going.[6] The books often reference real-world events, such as the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the September 11 attacks. Events that might seem of minor significance are included in some of the books, because of Connelly’s personal interest in them. For example, City of Bones, in which Detective Bosch investigates the murder of an 11-year-old boy, was written during Connelly\\'s early years as a father of a daughter, and it hit close to home. According to Connelly, he didn\\'t mean to write about the biggest fear of his life; it just came out that way.[30] David Geherin states that Connelly \"deliberately avoids ornate language, the kind that makes the reader stop and savor the choice of words or elegant phrasing. He doesn\\'t want anything to inhibit the forward momentum he is working to create.\"[31]\\nDetective Bosch\\'s life usually changes in harmony with Connelly\\'s own life. When Connelly moved 3,000 miles across the country, Bosch\\'s experiences sent him in a new direction in City of Bones, written at that time. According to Connelly, his \"real\" job is to write about Bosch,[30] and he brought McCaleb and Bosch together in A Darkness More Than Night in order to look at Bosch from another perspective and to keep the character interesting.[30]\\nConnelly often changes perspectives between characters in his novels. In Void Moon, Connelly frequently alternates between following protagonist Cassie Black and antagonist Jack Karch. In Fair Warning, Connelly outright changes the overarching perspective of the book on occasion, regularly following protagonist Jack McEvoy in a first-person point of view while occasionally branching away from his story to follow the antagonists in third-person.\\nEvery character in the list below, with one exception, has appeared in a Harry Bosch book.  All of Michael Connelly\\'s novels occur in the same fictional universe and character crossovers are common.\\nEach of these characters has appeared in at least two of Connelly\\'s novels.\\nHarry Bosch\\nNovel collections:\\nHarry Bosch series:\\nMickey Haller series:\\nStand-alones:\\n',\n",
       " '\\nPatricia Cornwell (born Patricia Carroll Daniels; June 9, 1956) is an American crime writer. She is known for her best-selling novels featuring medical examiner Kay Scarpetta, of which the first was inspired by a series of sensational murders in Richmond, Virginia, where most of the stories are set. The plots are notable for their emphasis on forensic science, which has influenced later TV treatments of police work. Cornwell has also initiated new research into the Jack the Ripper killings, incriminating the popular British artist Walter Sickert. Her books have sold more than 100 million copies.\\nA descendant of abolitionist and writer Harriet Beecher Stowe,[1] Cornwell was born on June 9, 1956, in Miami, Florida, second of three children, to Marilyn (née Zenner) and Sam Daniels. Her father was one of the leading appellate lawyers in the United States and served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black. Cornwell later traced her own motivations in life to the emotional abuse she says she suffered from her father, who walked out on the family on Christmas Day 1961. She has said, \"He was on his deathbed. We knew it was the last time we were seeing each other; he grabbed my brother\\'s hand and mouthed \\'I love you,\\' but he never touched me. All he did was write on a legal pad \\'How\\'s work?\\'\"[2]\\nIn 1961, Marilyn left with three children in tow and moved to Montreat, North Carolina. Ruth Bell Graham, wife of the evangelist Billy Graham took the wayward family in and arranged for Cornwell and her brothers, Jim and John, to be raised by Lenore and Manfred Saunders, who had recently returned from Africa. Marilyn Daniels, suffering from severe depression, was hospitalized. Cornwell turned to Ruth Bell Graham as an authority figure, and it was she who noticed that Cornwell\\'s talent lay in writing and encouraged her literary efforts. A bright student, a capable cartoonist, and a talented athlete on the tennis court, Cornwell attended King College in Bristol, Tennessee briefly before transferring to Davidson College on a tennis scholarship (which she later rejected), from where she graduated in 1979 with a B.A. in English.\\nIn 1979, Cornwell began working as a reporter for The Charlotte Observer, initially editing TV listings, then moving to features, and finally becoming a reporter covering crime. In 1980, she received the North Carolina Press Association\\'s  Investigative Reporting Award for a series on prostitution. She continued at the newspaper until 1981, when she moved to Richmond, Virginia with her first husband, Charles Cornwell (married in 1980), who enrolled at the Union Theological Seminary. The same year she began working on the biography of Ruth Bell Graham, A Time for Remembering: The Ruth Bell Graham Story (renamed Ruth, A Portrait: The Story of Ruth Bell Graham in subsequent editions), which was published in 1983. The biography gained a Gold Medallion Book Award from the Evangelic Christian Publishers Association in 1985. It also, however, was a major blow to her friendship with Graham – they weren\\'t on speaking terms for 8 years following the book\\'s publication.\\nCornwell began work on her first novel in 1984, about a male detective named Joe Constable and met Dr. Marcella Farinelli Fierro, a medical examiner in Richmond, and subsequent inspiration for the character of Dr. Kay Scarpetta. In 1985, she took a job at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia. She worked there for six years, first as a technical writer and then as a computer analyst. She also volunteered to work with the Richmond Police Department. Cornwell wrote three novels that she says were rejected before the publication in 1990, of the first installment of her Scarpetta series, Postmortem, based on real-life stranglings in Richmond in the summer of 1987. The novel won her various awards including the British John Creasey Award, the French Prix du Roman d\\'Adventure and the American Edgar Award.\\nThe Scarpetta novels include a great deal of detail on forensic science. The initial resolution to the mystery is found in the forensic investigation of the murder victim\\'s corpse, although Scarpetta does considerably more field investigation and confrontation with suspects than real-life medical examiners.[3] The novels generally climax with action scenes in which Scarpetta and her associates confront, or are confronted by, the killer or killers, usually concluding with the death of the killer. The novels are considered to have influenced the development of popular TV series on forensics, both fictional, such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,[4] and documentaries, such as Cold Case Files.[5]\\nOther significant themes in the Scarpetta novels include health, individual safety and security, food, family, and the emerging sexual self-discovery of Scarpetta\\'s niece. Often, conflicts and secret manipulations by Scarpetta\\'s colleagues and staff are involved in the story-line and make the murder cases more complex. Although scenes from the novels take place in a variety of locations around the United States and (less commonly) internationally, they center around the city of Richmond, Virginia.[6]\\nThere are two remarkable style shifts in the Scarpetta novels. Starting from The Last Precinct (2000), the style changes from past tense to present tense. Starting from Blow Fly (2003), the style changes from a first person to a third person, omniscient, narrator. Events are even narrated from the viewpoint of the murderers. Before Blow Fly the events are seen through Scarpetta\\'s eyes only, and other points of view only appear in letters that Scarpetta reads.\\nCornwell shifted back to a first-person perspective in the Scarpetta novel Port Mortuary (2010).\\nIn addition to the Scarpetta novels, Cornwell has written three pseudo-police fictions, known as the Trooper Andy Brazil/Superintendent Judy Hammer series, which are set in North Carolina, Virginia, and off the mid-Atlantic coast. Besides the older-woman/younger-man premise, the books include themes of scatology and sepsis.\\nCornwell has been involved in a continuing, self-financed search for evidence to support her theory that painter Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. She wrote Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper—Case Closed, which was published in 2002 to much controversy, especially within the British art world and among Ripperologists.[7][8][9] Cornwell denied being obsessed with Jack the Ripper in full-page ads in two British newspapers and has said the case was \"far from closed\".[10][11] In 2001, Cornwell was criticized for allegedly destroying one of Sickert\\'s paintings in pursuit of the Ripper\\'s identity.[12] She believed the well-known painter to be responsible for the string of murders and had purchased over thirty of his paintings and argued that they closely resembled the Ripper crime scenes.[12]  Cornwell also claimed a breakthrough: a letter written by someone purporting to be the killer had the same watermark as some of Sickert\\'s writing paper.[12] Ripper experts noted, however, that there were hundreds of letters from different authors falsely claiming to be the killer, and the watermark in question was on a brand of stationery that was widely available.[8]\\nShe made a brief appearance on the police procedural drama Criminal Minds in the episode \"True Genius\" as herself.\\nLeslie Sachs, author of The Virginia Ghost Murders (1998), claimed there were similarities between his novel and Cornwell\\'s The Last Precinct. In 2000, he sent letters to Cornwell\\'s publisher, started a web page, and placed stickers on copies of his novel alleging that Cornwell was committing plagiarism. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Cornwell a preliminary injunction against Sachs, opining that his claims were likely to be found baseless.[13]\\nIn 2007, during her libel suit against Sachs, Cornwell testified that Sachs had accused her in online postings of being a \"Jew hater\" and \"neo-Nazi\" who bribed judges, conspired to have him killed, and was under investigation by U.S. authorities.[14][15] The court permanently enjoined Sachs from making defamatory accusations against Cornwell and awarded Cornwell $37,780 in damages to cover the costs of defending herself against Sachs\\' internet attacks.[16]\\nIn 2004, Cornwell assigned management of her financial matters to New York-based Anchin, Block & Anchin, managed by principal Evan Snapper. Agreeing to pay the firm a base rate of $40,000/month,[17] her lawyer later claimed that Cornwell had hired Snapper to insulate herself from her money due to her ongoing mental health issues, and that Snapper knew this and took advantage of her over her four-and-a-half-year relationship with the company.[17]\\nCornwell fired the firm after discovering in July 2009 that the net worth of her and her company, Cornwell Entertainment Inc., despite having above $10 million in earnings per year during the previous four years, was a little under $13 million, the equivalent of only one year\\'s net income. After Cornwell filed the lawsuit, Snapper pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance regulations. The court case opened in January 2013, with Cornwell suing the firm for a combined sum of $100M.[17][18]  On February\\xa019, a Boston jury awarded Cornwell US$50.9\\u2009million (£33.4\\u2009million).[19]\\nOn June 14, 1980, shortly after graduating from Davidson College in North Carolina, she married one of her English professors, Charles L. Cornwell, who was 17 years her senior.[20] Professor Cornwell later left his tenured professorship to become a preacher. In 1989, the couple separated, with Patricia retaining her married name after the divorce.\\nIn 2006, Cornwell married Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard University.[21] However, she did not disclose news of her marriage until 2007.[22] Cornwell later stated that turning 50 had made her see the importance of speaking out for equal rights and spoke of how Billie Jean King had helped her come to terms with talking about her sexuality publicly.[23] She lives with Gruber in Massachusetts.[24][25]\\nSince childhood, Cornwell has been friends with the family of evangelist Billy Graham and his wife Ruth Bell, often serving as the family\\'s unofficial spokesperson to the media.[26]  She also wrote an authorized biography of Ruth Bell Graham.  Cornwell was previously a personal friend of former President George H. W. Bush, whom she referred to as \"Big George\", spending a number of weeks at the family\\'s summer retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine.\\nCornwell has in the past suffered from anorexia nervosa and depression, which began in her late teens.[2][27] She spoke openly about her struggle with bipolar disorder,[27] but in 2015 said that she was misdiagnosed.[28]\\nOn January 10, 1993, Cornwell crashed her Mercedes-Benz while under the influence of alcohol. She was convicted of drunk driving and sentenced to 28 days in a treatment center.[29]\\nSince 1998, Cornwell has donated at least $130,000 to the Republican Party, and has made additional individual contributions to Republican U.S. Senate candidates, including George Allen, John Warner, and Orrin Hatch.[30] She has occasionally supported specific Democratic candidates as well, including Hillary Clinton, Nicola Tsongas, Charles Robb, and Mark Warner.[30]\\nCornwell has spoken negatively of the presidency of George W. Bush, saying, \"I was supportive of young George W. Bush because I liked his family. I thought he was going to be another Big George. Boy, was I ever wrong. It\\'s not a democracy so much as a theocracy, and those are not the principles this country was founded on.\"[31]\\nCornwell has made several notable charitable donations, including funding the Virginia Institute for Forensic Science and Medicine,[32] funding scholarships to the University of Tennessee\\'s National Forensics Academy and Davidson College\\'s Creative Writing Program (the result of which is the Patricia Cornwell Creative Writing Scholarship, awarded to one or two incoming freshmen), and donating her collection of Walter Sickert paintings to Harvard University.[33] As a member of the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital\\'s National Council, she is an advocate for psychiatric research.  She has also made million-dollar donations to the John Jay College of Criminal Justice for the Crime Scene Academy[34] and to the Harvard Art Museum.[35] She donated funds to the Richmond City Police Dept. and neighboring Henrico County Police Dept. to purchase bullet-proof vests for the police dogs. Cornwell is also a major contributor at the Five Star level to the Veterans Village of San Diego, with lifetime giving of more than $250,000.[36]\\n',\n",

In addition, beginning in the 1960s, she published numerous popular mystery novels with a woman protagonist, under the pen name of Amanda Cross.[1] These have been translated into numerous languages and in total sold nearly one million copies worldwide.\\nHeilbrun was born in East Orange, New Jersey, to Archibald Gold and Estelle (Roemer) Gold. The family moved to Manhattan\\'s Upper West Side when she was a child.[1]\\nHeilbrun graduated from Wellesley College in 1947 with a major in English. Afterwards, she studied English literature at Columbia University, receiving her M.A. in 1951 and Ph.D. in 1959.[1][2]  Among her most important mentors were Columbia professors Jacques Barzun and Lionel Trilling, while Clifton Fadiman was an important inspiration: She wrote about these three in her final non-fiction work, When Men Were the Only Models We Had:  My Teachers Barzun, Fadiman, Trilling (2002).\\nHeilbrun taught English at Columbia for more than three decades, from 1960 to 1992.[2] She was the first woman to receive tenure in the English Department and held an endowed position.[3] Her academic specialty was British modern literature, with a particular interest in the Bloomsbury Group.[1] Her academic books include the feminist study Writing a Woman\\'s Life (1988).

Through her novels, all set in academia, Heilbrun explored issues in feminism, academic politics, women\\'s friendships, and other social and political themes. Death in a Tenured Position (1981, set at Harvard University) was particularly harsh in its criticism of the academic establishment\\'s treatment of women.

She also had a Summer house in Alford, Massachusetts.[8] At the age of 68, she purchased a new home to use by herself, as she wanted a private place. She held strong opinions on nearly every aspect of women\\'s lives and also believed that ending one\\'s own life was a basic human right. In keeping with her views on aging in The Last Gift of Time: Life Beyond Sixty, she quit wearing high heels, hose, and form-fitting clothing in her early 60s. She adopted blouses and slacks as her daily attire. Heilbrun\\'s son recalled, \"My mother was a generous hostess when she was young, but lost interest in dinner parties as she got older. She preferred to order groceries from the local supermarket and have them sent to her apartment as she was too busy to waste time squeezing oranges at Fairway.\"[9]\\nIn the book The Last Gift of Time: Life Beyond Sixty, Heilbrun expressed her desire to take her own life on her 70th birthday because \"there is no joy in life past that point, only to experience the miserable endgame.\" She turned 70 in January 1996 and did not follow up on her idea at the time. She lived another seven years.\\nOne fall morning in 2003, she went for a walk around New York City with her longtime friend Mary Ann Caws and told the latter: \"I feel sad.\" When Caws prompted her why, Heilbrun responded: \"The universe.\"[9] Afterward, she went home to her apartment.

He has since gone on to write several stand alone books and is currently working on a new series set in St. Louis.\\nChris Culver was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma and moved to Chickasha, Oklahoma shortly thereafter. He and his family moved to Newburgh, Indiana when he was seven years old.\\nChris Culver read a lot as a child in elementary school. His favorite authors at that time were J. R. R. Tolkien and Stephen King. His love of books extended to the classroom where he even sneaked extra books beneath his desk and read during class.   In fifth grade, he did a book report on Michael Crichton’s The Andromeda Strain since the assignment was to read something scary and report what made it so. While his fellow classmates chose to write about ghosts and things that go bump in the night, he wrote about the horrors of biological warfare.[1]\\nHe first became interested in writing crime fiction after picking up a dog-eared, coffee-stained paperback copy of Mickey Spillane\\'s I, the Jury in a library book sale.[2]\\nChris Culver completed his undergraduate studies at a private liberal arts college in southern Indiana. There he majored in philosophy and met his future wife.  Afterwards, he attended law school.  He then enrolled in a PhD program in philosophy at Purdue,[3] but left before completing his full degree when his wife was offered a faculty position in Arkansas.[1]\\nAfter graduate school, Chris Culver taught classes in ethics, the philosophy of religion, and religious studies at a small university in Arkansas. It was during this time that he wrote his first Ash Rashid novel. He credits his inspiration for the character creation to his students and their hardships.  About Ash Rashid, he writes, \"In a lot of ways, he\\'s my idea of a hero. He doesn\\'t have special powers or abilities, but he tries his best to do what\\'s right. People occasionally ask me if he\\'s based on a real person. He\\'s not, but I hope there are people like him out there. The world needs people like that.\"[1] He chose to write Ash Rashid as a Muslim detective partly to add depth to his background and make him seem more human[4] and partly because he was \"tired of reading books and seeing movies that portray all Muslims as terrorists of zealots.\"[5]\\nHe currently lives near St. Louis, MO with his family.[6]\\nThe Abbey was the fourth novel Chris Culver wrote, but the first he considered good enough to publish.  He wrote ten query letters to literary agents.  They either did not have interest in the book, didn\\'t respond, or were unsure of its potential on the market.[7]  He then decided to self-publish The Abbey in February 2011.  He was pleased and surprised that he sold so well on his own.[5] As of early 2013, his e-book sales totaled more than 750,000 copies.[8] The early success attracted the attention of a literary agent[7] and publisher, Hachette Book Group with whom he sold three Ash Rashid series books.\\nHe published two books, Just Run and Nine Years Gone without a publisher in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

Furthermore, one of Cussler\\'s uncles served in the Imperial German Air Service and became a flying ace, shooting down 14 Allied aeroplanes.[5]\\nHe was awarded the rank of Eagle Scout when he was 14 years old.[6] He attended Pasadena City College[2] for two years and then enlisted in the United States Air Force during the Korean War.[7] During his service with the Air Force, he was promoted to sergeant and worked as an aircraft mechanic and flight engineer for the Military Air Transport Service (MATS).[8]\\nAfter his discharge from the military, Cussler went to work for the advertising industry, first as a copywriter and later as a creative director for two of the nation\\'s most successful advertising agencies.[2] As part of his duties, Cussler produced radio and television commercials, many of which won international awards including an award at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.[9]\\nAfter the publication in 1996 of Cussler\\'s first nonfiction work, The Sea Hunters, he was awarded a Doctor of Letters degree in 1997 by the Board of Governors of the State University of New York Maritime College who accepted the work in lieu of a Ph.D. thesis. This was the first time in the college\\'s 123-year history that such a degree had been awarded.[2]\\nIn 2002, Cussler was awarded the Naval Heritage Award from the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation for his efforts concerning marine exploration.[10]\\nCussler was a fellow of the Explorers Club of New York, the Royal Geographical Society in London, and the American Society of Oceanographers.[11]\\nClive Cussler began writing in 1965 when his wife took a job working nights for the local police department where they lived in California. After making dinner for the children and putting them to bed, he had no one to talk to and nothing much to do, so he decided to start writing.[12] His most famous character is marine engineer, government agent and adventurer Dirk Pitt. The Dirk Pitt novels frequently have an alternative history premise—such as \"what if Atlantis were real?\" or \"what if Abraham Lincoln wasn\\'t assassinated but was kidnapped?\"[citation needed]\\nThe first two Pitt novels, The Mediterranean Caper and Iceberg, were relatively conventional maritime thrillers. The third, Raise the Titanic!, made Cussler\\'s reputation and established the pattern that subsequent Pitt novels would follow: a blend of adventure and advanced technology, generally involving megalomaniacal villains, lost ships, beautiful women, and sunken treasure.\\nCussler\\'s novels almost always begin with a chapter set in the past. These contain none of the novel\\'s main characters and often seem disconnected from the plot until the main characters discover a mystery or secret relating the events of the first chapter to the rest of the story. This is almost always in the form of a long-lost artifact that is important to the villain\\'s or hero\\'s objectives. Often in the first chapter, a ship or airplane carrying a top-secret, important, or dangerous cargo is lost and never found, until it is recovered by a modern character later in the book.\\nCussler\\'s novels, like those of Michael Crichton, are examples of techno-thrillers that do not use military plots and settings. Where Crichton strove for scrupulous realism, however, Cussler prefers fantastic spectacles and outlandish plot devices. The Pitt novels, in particular, have the improbable quality of the James Bond or Indiana Jones movies, while also sometimes borrowing from Alistair MacLean\\'s novels. Pitt himself is a super-hero reminiscent of Doc Savage and other characters from pulp magazines.\\nCussler had seventeen consecutive titles listed on The New York Times fiction best seller list.[7] In 2014, McFarland Publishing released The Clive Cussler Adventures: A Critical Review by Steven Philip Jones, the first critical review textbook of Cussler\\'s novels.[13]\\nAs an underwater explorer, Cussler discovered more than 60 shipwreck sites[14] and wrote non-fiction books about his findings. He was also the initiator of the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), a non-profit organization with the same name as the fictional government agency that employs Dirk Pitt.\\nImportant finds by NUMA include:\\nA visual and interactive depiction of Cussler\\'s NUMA Foundation Expeditions has been made available as an extension of NUMA\\'s original website that has since been deleted.\\nFinds formerly believed to be important include:\\nIn what started as a joke in the novel Dragon that Cussler expected his editor to remove, he would often write himself into his books. At first he wrote himself simple cameos, but later as something of a deus ex machina, providing the novel\\'s protagonists with some essential assistance or information. Often, the character is given an alias and not revealed as Cussler until his exit, with the characters remarking either on his odd name or how familiar he looks, despite their memory of him not being clear.\\nThe cameos include the Dirk Pitt Adventures, as well as the Fargo Adventures books Lost Empire, Spartan Gold, Kingdom, and The Tombs. The Tombs also includes his wife, Janet.\\nAt least two other types of recurring in-jokes are less obvious to a casual reader. One is the frequent reuse of the name Leigh Hunt for different characters in different novels. Seventeen books have had a character with this name, frequently in the opening prologues, frequently a sailor, usually dying; a notable exception is the first (in chronological order) Dirk Pitt adventure, Pacific Vortex!, in which Admiral Leigh Hunter is a major character, commander of the 101st Recovery Fleet in Hawaii. In the introduction to Arctic Drift, Cussler says there was a real Leigh Hunt who died in 2007 and the novel is dedicated to him. Another is that significant events in several novels occur on July 15 (Cussler\\'s birthday). He also used the name \"Periwinkle\" in his works. In The Adventures of Vin Fiz, Sahara, and numerous other works, there appears a donkey named Periwinkle. In Valhalla Rising, the Periwinkle is the name of a catamaran in which Pitt, Giordino, and Misty Graham are rescued by none other than Cussler himself. Cussler\\'s friend Craig Dirgo is mentioned in several books.[citation needed]\\nClive Cussler married Barbara Knight in 1955, and they remained married for nearly 50 years until her death in 2003.[17] Together they had three children—Teri, Dirk, and Dayna—four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.[18] Cussler\\'s daughter Teri is the creator and manager of the Cussler Museum[19] in Arvada, Colorado, where Cussler\\'s collection of classic automobiles is on display. Cussler also married Janet Horvath, who survived him. Clive Cussler was a part-time resident of both Arizona and Colorado.[20]\\nCussler died at his home in Paradise Valley, Arizona, on February 24, 2020, at age 88 of undisclosed causes.[18]\\n1) Although published in 1983, Pacific Vortex! was written and is set before The Mediterranean Caper.\\n2) Also published as Mayday!\\n3) Novels featuring Dirk Pitt and his children Dirk Pitt, Jr. and Summer Pitt.\\n4) Novels co-authored with Clive Cussler\\'s son, Dirk.\\n5) Novels authored by Dirk Cussler.\\nThis series of books is based on the character Kurt Austin, Team Leader of NUMA\\'s Special Assignments division and his adventures. Some characters from the Pitt novels appear such as Sandecker, Al Giordino, Rudi Gunn, Hiram Yaeger and St. Julien Perlmutter. Pitt makes brief appearances in the books Serpent, White Death, Polar Shift, Devil\\'s Gate, The Storm, Zero Hour, and Ghost Ship and is mentioned in Lost City. Juan Cabrillo, the captain of the ship Oregon, also made a brief appearance in The Pharaoh\\'s Secret.\\nThis series of books features a ship named the Oregon, which Cussler introduced in the Dirk Pitt Adventures novel Flood Tide (1997). While appearing to be a decrepit freighter, it is actually a high-tech advanced ship used by an unnamed and mysterious \"Corporation\" under the leadership of Juan Cabrillo. The ship is run like a business, with its crew being shareholders, taking jobs for the CIA and other agencies to help stop crime and terrorism. The crew is adept at disguises, combat, computer hacking and more to aid them in their missions. Kurt Austin, Joe Zavala, and Dirk Pitt all make cameo appearances in the fourth volume, Skeleton Coast (Cabrillo speaks to Pitt on the telephone; and Austin and Zavala appear at the end).\\nThese books are set mostly in the U.S. in the early part of the 20th century. They center around Isaac Bell, a brilliant investigator for the Van Dorn Detective Agency, which appears to be modeled after the real-life Pinkerton Agency. Like Pitt, Bell has an affinity for automobiles and is a crack shot. The first book reveals that Bell survives into 1950 with a wife and grown children. Though the setting is a century ago, the books still qualify as techno-thrillers, since they feature the advanced technology of that time such as private express trains, telegraphs, telephones, dreadnought battleships and early airplanes. Isaac Bell also is a principal character of the background story in the Fargo Adventures novel The Gray Ghost.\\nThe series focuses on Sam and Remi Fargo, a married couple who are professional treasure hunters.\\n(*) indicates books co-authored with Paul Kemprecos.\\n(†) indicates books co-authored with Graham Brown.\\n(††) indicates books authored by Graham Brown.\\n(‡) indicates books co-authored with Craig Dirgo.\\n(§) indicates books co-authored with Jack Du Brul.\\n(§§) indicates books authored by Jack Du Brul.\\n(‖) indicates books co-authored with Justin Scott.\\n(^) indicates books co-authored with Grant Blackwood.\\n(+) indicates books co-authored with Thomas Perry.\\n(×) indicates books co-authored with Russell Blake.\\n(≠) indicates books co-authored with Boyd Morrison.\\n(**) indicates books co-authored with Robin Burcell.\\n(***) indicates books authored by Robin Burcell.\\n(╛) indicates books authored by Mike Maden.\\n',\n",

He wrote his first story 'Pretpuri', a Boroda story, when he was only 15 years. After matriculation, he joined the Vidyasagar College, Kolkata. Sisir Bhaduri, the doyen of Bengali stage, was his English professor there. After completing graduation, he went on to study law in Patna. He was only thirty years old when he gave up his practice and started working as a writer. In 1928, Himangshu Roy invited him to Bombay to write screenplays. Till 1952 he wrote films, and then settled down in Pune to pursue a full-fledged career as a writer.[5]\\nByomkesh Bakshi is a detective who calls himself Satyanweshi or the truth-seeker.

The protagonist of the series Sadashib is a Maratha soldier hailing from the village Dongarhpur. This character was created with the backdrop of 16th century Maharashtra when the Maratha-Adil Shah-Mughal antipathy was at its pinnacle. The conflict of Chhatrapati Shivaji and Aurangzeb provided the series with its own distinctive plot.[6][7]\\nAs per the pretext of the series, the Mughals were residing on Daulatabad north of Maharashtra and Sultan Adil Shah was in the charge of Bijapur fort in the south. Although at the time of the story's beginning the forces of Shivaji had not yet earned the total trust of entire mass, they were on the rise to end the daily oppression of the simple villagers and the common people in the hands of the tyrant rulers. During this time Sadashib, an orphan boy of around seventeen to eighteen was growing up in his maternal uncle's house in the village Dongarhpur with his uncle and aunt who strongly despised him. One day, his maternal uncle Sakharam decides to throw him out of his home after consulting with the villages head and other elders citing the reason that he is unable to provide sustenance to his household in the time of war and crisis. Sadashiv, who has nobody in the village to turn to leaves, but his friend Kumkum, the daughter of village elder Biththal Patil, advises him to go and join Shivaji's troops. Later, Kumkum helps him escape on the ailing horse of her father. Sadashiv sets course for Puna,[b] but he encounters Shivaji's forces en route, eventually helps them unknowingly. They take him to Torna, where Shivaji was camping and he joins Shivaji's force and gets popular by the day on the merit of his young as well as cunning stature.

Who can create that atmosphere, who else has the wit and humour…his prose had a different taste altogether – I am rather fond of it....’ that's what Sunil Gangopadhyay said about Saradindu Bandopadhyay regarding his historical novels and stories.  Set in different periods of Indian history, right from the Pre-Aryan days to the Gupta, Mauryan era till the age of the Mughals – they are a unique blend of scintillating twists and turns, of romance, adventure and revenge, characters brought to life by a unique idiom and vocabulary to suit the ethos of that bygone era.\\nSaradindu himself said – 'My stories are not fictionalised history, they are historical fiction.[17] Since the writer spent the latter half of his life in Maharashtra, Pune and the Western Ghats form a picturesque backdrop to quite a few of his stories, many of which narrate tales of the Maratha hero, Chhatrapati Shivaji.\\nSocial:\\nDadar Kirti [দাদার কীর্তি]\\nScreenplay:\\n\",\n",

His characters have spawned a sequel series, Lewis from 2006 to 2015, and a prequel series, Endeavour from 2012 to 2023.\\nDexter was born in Stamford, Lincolnshire, to Alfred and Dorothy Dexter.[1] He had an elder brother, John,[2] a fellow classicist, who taught Classics at The King\\'s School, Peterborough, and a sister, Avril.[3] Alfred ran a small garage and taxi company from premises in Scotgate, Stamford.[4] Dexter was educated at St John\\'s Infants School and Bluecoat Junior School, from which he gained a scholarship to Stamford School, a boys\\' grammar school, where a younger contemporary was England cricket captain and England rugby player M. J. K. Smith.[2][5]\\nAfter leaving school, Dexter completed his national service with the Royal Corps of Signals and then read Classics at Christ\\'s College, Cambridge, graduating in 1953 and receiving a master\\'s degree in 1958.[5]\\nIn 1954, Dexter began his teaching career as assistant Classics master at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester. There he helped the school\\'s Christian Union.[6] However, in 2000 he stated that he shared the same views on politics and religion as Inspector Morse,[7] who was portrayed in the final Morse novel, The Remorseful Day, as an atheist. A post at Loughborough Grammar School followed in 1957, then he took up the position of senior Classics teacher at Corby Grammar School, Northamptonshire, in 1959.\\nIn 1966, he was forced by the onset of deafness to retire from teaching and took up the post of senior assistant secretary at the University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE) in Oxford, a job he held until his retirement in 1988.[8]\\nIn November 2008, Dexter featured prominently in the BBC Four programme \"How to Solve a Cryptic Crossword\" as part of the Timeshift series, in which he recounted some of the crossword clues solved by Morse.[9]\\nThe initial books written by Dexter were general studies textbooks.[10] He began writing mysteries in 1972 during a family holiday. Last Bus to Woodstock was published in 1975 and introduced the character of Inspector Morse, the irascible detective whose penchants for cryptic crosswords, English literature, cask ale, and music by Wagner reflected Dexter\\'s own enthusiasms. Dexter\\'s plots used false leads and other red herrings,[11] \"presenting Morse, and his readers, with fiendishly difficult puzzles to solve\".[12]\\nThe success of the 33 two-hour episodes of the ITV television series Inspector Morse, produced between 1987 and 2000, brought further attention to Dexter\\'s writings.

Endeavour was first broadcast on the ITV network in 2012, ending with the ninth series in 2023, taking young Morse\\'s career into 1972.[14] Dexter was a consultant for Lewis and the first few years of Endeavour. As with Morse, Dexter occasionally made cameo appearances in both Lewis and Endeavour.[15]\\nAlthough Dexter\\'s military service was as a Morse code operator in the Royal Corps of Signals, the character was named after his friend Sir Jeremy Morse, a crossword devotee like Dexter.[12] The music for the television series, written by Barrington Pheloung, used a motif based on the Morse code for Morse\\'s name.[16]\\nDexter received several Crime Writers\\' Association awards: two Silver Daggers for Service of All the Dead in 1979 and The Dead of Jericho in 1981; two Gold Daggers for The Wench is Dead in 1989 and The Way Through the Woods in 1992; and a Cartier Diamond Dagger for lifetime achievement in 1997.[8] In 1996, Dexter received a Macavity Award for his short story \"Evans Tries an O-Level\".

He also turned to other genres; including historical fiction, thrillers, and later a true story of a Holocaust survivor\\'s family during World War II, Maybe You Will Survive.[2] Several of his early novels were published in the UK by Methuen and much of his work by Endeavour Press and Venture Press in UK.\\nUnder the pen name Rochelle Leslie (the names of his two daughters), he authored Tears of Passion, Tears of Shame, a novel of South Africa set during the Zulu War of 1879 which was subsequently published in Italy, titled, Venuto De Lontano, (To Come From Far Away) by Mondadori. In 2018 it was released as \\'Cry For Freedom\\' by Lime books in the UK. He also has had various short stories published in anthologies.\\nDiamond released Chocolate Lenin in 2012. A satire/fantasy of near-future Russia, the novel parodied contemporary science, technology, and politics.\\nIn 2013 it was announced that his first novel, The Haven, would be re-released in a new oversize format. In 2015 Venture Press Ltd, UK, a division of Endeavour Press UK, released in e-book format seven of Graham Diamond\\'s earlier titles including The Haven, Samarkand, Samarkand Dawn, and Lady of the Haven.\\nIn 2016, Endeavour Press published Black Midnight, a terrorist novel set in New York City, and Cry For Freedom, a novel set during the Zulu War in Natal in 1879. In early 2018 Endeavour next released Maybe You Will Survive the true story of a Holocaust survivor. Venture Press also re-released six of Diamond\\'s speculative fiction/fantasy novels including The Thief of Kalimar, and Captain Sinbad.\\nLume Books, London, issued a new print version of Maybe You Will Survive in 2020 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the ending of the Holocaust. The following year The Haven, The Thief of Kalimar, Black Midnight, Forest Wars, Tears of Passion, Tears of Shame, Captain Sinbad and Chocolate Lenin were re-released in softcover in the United Kingdom.\\nIn 2022, Diamond released Diner of Lost Souls, a mystery/thriller written in conjunction with Hedy Campeas and published by Lion Press. In June 2023 a second volume, Diner of Lost Souls, Book 2, was released.\\nA Reader\\'s Guide to Fantasy described Diamond\\'s fiction as \"adding a dash of imagination to subjects and themes common in fantasy and making them something unusual and original.\"[6] Library Journal called his 1981 novel The Beast of Hades a \"second-rate fantasy\"[7] but described Samarkand from the previous year as \"an absorbing historical fantasy focusing on love and adventures.[8]\\nThe St. James Guide to Fantasy Writers described Diamond as having written \"several undeservedly neglected novels. Apart from the generous Andre Norton, few took him seriously as a fantasy author—yet he is better than, or no worse than, some writers who are now dragonhold names. The Haven and its sequels, and Captain Sinbad, provide more than enough justification for wider popularity.\"[5] \\'The Haven\\' has remained in print for more than forty years.\\n',\n",
       " 'David Francis Dodge (August 18, 1910, Berkeley, California – August 8, 1974, San Miguel de Allende, Mexico) was an American author of mystery/thriller novels and humorous travel books. His first book was published in 1941. His fiction is characterized by tight plotting, brisk dialogue, memorable and well-defined characters, and often exotic locations. His travel writing documented the adventures and misadventures of the Dodge family (David, his wife Elva  and daughter Kendal) as they roamed around the world. Practical advice and information for the traveler on a budget are sprinkled liberally throughout the books.\\nDavid Dodge was born in Berkeley, California, the youngest child of George Andrew Dodge, a San Francisco architect, and Maude Ellingwood Bennett Dodge. Following George\\'s death in an automobile accident, Maude \"Monnie\" Dodge moved the family (David and his three older sisters, Kathryn, Frances, and Marian) to Southern California, where David attended Lincoln High School in Los Angeles but did not graduate.[1]\\nAfter leaving school, he worked as a bank messenger, a marine fireman, a stevedore, and a night watchman. In 1934, he went to work for the San Francisco accounting firm of McLaren, Goode & Company, becoming a Certified Public Accountant in 1937. On July 17, 1936, he was married to Elva Keith, a former Macmillan Company editorial representative, and their only daughter, Kendal, was born in 1940. After the attack on Pearl Harbor he joined the U.S. Naval Reserve, emerging three years later with the rank of Lieutenant Commander.\\nDavid Dodge\\'s first experience as a writer came through his involvement with the Macondray Lane Players, a group of amateur playwrights, producers, and actors whose goal was to create a theater purely for pleasure. The group was founded by George Henry Burkhardt (Dodge\\'s brother-in-law) and performed exclusively at Macondria, a little theater located in the basement of Burkhardt\\'s house at 56 Macondray Lane on San Francisco\\'s Russian Hill.[2] His publishing career began in 1936 when he won First Prize in the Northern California Drama Association\\'s Third Annual One Act Play Tournament. The prize-winning play, \"A Certain Man Had Two Sons,\" was subsequently published by the Banner Play Bureau, of San Francisco. Another Dodge play, \"Christmas Eve at the Mermaid,\" co-written by Loyall McLaren (his boss at McLaren, Goode & Co.), was performed as the Bohemian Club\\'s Christmas play of 1940, and again in 1959. In 1961, the Grabhorn Press published the play in a volume entitled Shakespeare in Bohemia.\\nHis career as a writer really began, however, when he made a bet with his wife that he could write a better mystery novel than the ones they were reading during a rainy family vacation. He drew on his professional experience as a CPA and wrote his first novel, Death and Taxes, featuring San Francisco tax expert and reluctant detective James \"Whit\" Whitney. It was published by Macmillan in 1941 and he won five dollars from Elva. Three more Whitney novels soon followed: Shear the Black Sheep (Macmillan, 1942), Bullets for the Bridegroom (Macmillan, 1944) and It Ain\\'t Hay (Simon & Schuster, 1946), in which Whit tangles with marijuana smugglers. With its subject matter and extremely evocative cover art on both the first edition dust jacket and the paperback reprint, this book remains one of Dodge\\'s most collectible titles.\\nUpon his release from active duty by the Navy in 1945, Dodge left San Francisco and set out for Guatemala by car with his wife and daughter, beginning his second career as a travel writer. The Dodge family\\'s misadventures on the road through Mexico are hilariously documented in How Green Was My Father (Simon & Schuster, 1947). His Latin American experiences also produced a second series character, expatriate private investigator and tough-guy adventurer Al Colby, who first appears in The Long Escape (Random House, 1948).\\nAfter two more well-received Colby books in 1949 and 1950, Dodge abandoned series characters and focused on stand-alone suspense adventures set in exotic locales around the world; To Catch a Thief was Dodge\\'s greatest career success, primarily due to the fact the Alfred Hitchcock purchased film rights before the novel was even published in 1952 and turned it into the 1955 Paramount film starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.\\nFor the remainder of his career, Dodge alternated between mystery and travel writing, continuing the saga of the Dodge family as they bumble and bargain their way around the world. The Poor Man’s Guide to Europe, a \"tipsheet for nickel-nursers and skinflints\" appeared in 1953 and was so successful that Random House issued annual revised editions from 1954 to 1959. It was also a Book-of-the-Month Club selection. Although this book was a more traditional—and practical—travel book, it too was liberally sprinkled with anecdotes of the Dodge family\\'s personal experiences. He also wrote numerous travel articles for various magazines, appearing as a regular contributor to Holiday magazine from 1948 to 1968.\\nIn 1968, David and Elva settled in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. Elva died on October 17, 1973. David died less than a year later on August 8, 1974. They are both buried in San Miguel.\\nAlthough a writer by profession, Dodge\\'s true love was travel. He was fond of explaining that while many writers traveled in order to gather material to write about, his goal was to write in order to gather money to travel.\\nIn 2005, Hard Case Crime reprinted Dodge\\'s second Al Colby novel, Plunder of the Sun, and in 2006 published his last completed novel, The Last Match. The manuscript, which remained unsold at the time of his death, was discovered among his papers.[3]\\nBruin Books reprinted Death and Taxes and To Catch a Thief in 2010, The Long Escape in 2011, and Carambola in 2016.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nSir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle KStJ, DL (22 May 1859\\xa0– 7 July 1930) was a British writer and physician. He created the character Sherlock Holmes in 1887 for A Study in Scarlet, the first of four novels and fifty-six short stories about Holmes and Dr. Watson. The Sherlock Holmes stories are milestones in the field of crime fiction.\\nDoyle was a prolific writer; other than Holmes stories, his works include fantasy and science fiction stories about Professor Challenger, and humorous stories about the Napoleonic soldier Brigadier Gerard, as well as plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction, and historical novels. One of Doyle\\'s early short stories, \"J. Habakuk Jephson\\'s Statement\" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the Mary Celeste.\\nDoyle is often referred to as \"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\" or \"Conan Doyle\", implying that \"Conan\" is part of a compound surname rather than a middle name. His baptism entry in the register of St Mary\\'s Cathedral, Edinburgh, gives \"Arthur Ignatius Conan\" as his given names and \"Doyle\" as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his godfather.[1] The catalogues of the British Library and the Library of Congress treat \"Doyle\" alone as his surname.[2]\\nSteven Doyle, publisher of The Baker Street Journal, wrote: \"Conan was Arthur\\'s middle name. Shortly after he graduated from high school he began using Conan as a sort of surname. But technically his last name is simply \\'Doyle\\'.\"[3] When knighted, he was gazetted as Doyle, not under the compound Conan Doyle.[4]\\nDoyle was born on 22 May 1859 at 11 Picardy Place, Edinburgh, Scotland.[5][6] His father, Charles Altamont Doyle, was born in England, of Irish Catholic descent, and his mother, Mary (née Foley), was Irish Catholic. His parents married in 1855.[7] In 1864 the family scattered because of Charles\\'s growing alcoholism, and the children were temporarily housed across Edinburgh. Arthur lodged with Mary Burton, the aunt of a friend, at Liberton Bank House on Gilmerton Road, while studying at Newington Academy.[8]\\nIn 1867, the family came together again and lived in squalid tenement flats at 3 Sciennes Place.[9] Doyle\\'s father died in 1893, in the Crichton Royal, Dumfries, after many years of psychiatric illness.[10][11] Beginning at an early age, throughout his life Doyle wrote letters to his mother, and many of them were preserved.[12]\\nSupported by wealthy uncles, Doyle was sent to England, to the Jesuit preparatory school Hodder Place, Stonyhurst in Lancashire, at the age of nine (1868–70). He then went on to Stonyhurst College, which he attended until 1875. While Doyle was not unhappy at Stonyhurst, he said he did not have any fond memories of it because the school was run on medieval principles: the only subjects covered were rudiments, rhetoric, Euclidean geometry, algebra, and the classics.[13] Doyle commented later in his life that this academic system could only be excused \"on the plea that any exercise, however stupid in itself, forms a sort of mental dumbbell by which one can improve one\\'s mind\".[13] He also found the school harsh, noting that, instead of compassion and warmth, it favoured the threat of corporal punishment and ritual humiliation.[14]\\nFrom 1875 to 1876, he was educated at the Jesuit school Stella Matutina in Feldkirch, Austria.[9] His family decided that he would spend a year there in order to perfect his German and broaden his academic horizons.[15] He later rejected the Catholic faith and became an agnostic.[16] One source attributed his drift away from religion to the time he spent in the less strict Austrian school.[14] He also later became a spiritualist mystic.[17]\\nFrom 1876 to 1881, Doyle studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School; during this period he spent time working in Aston (then a town in Warwickshire, now part of Birmingham), Sheffield and Ruyton-XI-Towns, Shropshire.[18] Also during this period, he studied practical botany at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh.[19] While studying, Doyle began writing short stories. His earliest extant fiction, \"The Haunted Grange of Goresthorpe\", was unsuccessfully submitted to Blackwood\\'s Magazine.[9] His first published piece, \"The Mystery of Sasassa Valley\", a story set in South Africa, was printed in Chambers\\'s Edinburgh Journal on 6 September 1879.[9][20] On 20 September 1879, he published his first academic article, \"Gelsemium as a Poison\" in the British Medical Journal,[9][21][22] a study which The Daily Telegraph regarded as potentially useful in a 21st-century murder investigation.[23]\\nDoyle was the doctor on the Greenland whaler Hope of Peterhead in 1880.[24] On 11 July 1880, John Gray\\'s Hope and David Gray\\'s Eclipse met up with the Eira and Leigh Smith. The photographer W. J. A. Grant took a photograph aboard the Eira of Doyle along with Smith, the Gray brothers, and ship\\'s surgeon William Neale, who were members of the Smith expedition. That expedition explored Franz Josef Land, and led to the naming, on 18 August, of Cape Flora, Bell Island, Nightingale Sound, Gratton (\"Uncle Joe\") Island, and Mabel Island.[25]\\nAfter graduating with Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery (M.B. C.M.) degrees from the University of Edinburgh in 1881, he was ship\\'s surgeon on the SS Mayumba during a voyage to the West African coast.[9] He completed his Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree (an advanced degree beyond the basic medical qualification in the UK) with a dissertation on tabes dorsalis in 1885.[26][27]\\nIn 1882, Doyle partnered with his former classmate George Turnavine Budd in a medical practice in Plymouth, but their relationship proved difficult, and Doyle soon left to set up an independent practice.[9][28] Arriving in Portsmouth in June 1882, with less than £10 (£1100 in 2019[29]) to his name, he set up a medical practice at 1 Bush Villas in Elm Grove, Southsea.[30] The practice was not successful. While waiting for patients, Doyle returned to writing fiction.\\nDoyle was a staunch supporter of compulsory vaccination and wrote several articles advocating the practice and denouncing the views of anti-vaccinators.[31][32]\\nIn early 1891, Doyle embarked on the study of ophthalmology in Vienna. He had previously studied at the Portsmouth Eye Hospital in order to qualify to perform eye tests and prescribe glasses. Vienna had been suggested by his friend Vernon Morris as a place to spend six months and train to be an eye surgeon. But Doyle found it too difficult to understand the German medical terms being used in his classes in Vienna, and soon quit his studies there. For the rest of his two-month stay in Vienna, he pursued other activities, such as ice skating with his wife Louisa and drinking with Brinsley Richards of the London Times. He also wrote The Doings of Raffles Haw.\\nAfter visiting Venice and Milan, he spent a few days in Paris observing Edmund Landolt, an expert on diseases of the eye. Within three months of his departure for Vienna, Doyle returned to London. He opened a small office and consulting room at 2 Upper Wimpole Street, or 2 Devonshire Place as it was then. (There is today a Westminster City Council commemorative plaque over the front door.) He had no patients, according to his autobiography, and his efforts as an ophthalmologist were a failure.[33][34][35]\\nDoyle struggled to find a publisher. His first work featuring Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, A Study in Scarlet, was written in three weeks when he was 27 and was accepted for publication by Ward Lock & Co on 20 November 1886, which gave Doyle £25 (equivalent to £2,900 in 2019) in exchange for all rights to the story. The piece appeared a year later in the Beeton\\'s Christmas Annual and received good reviews in The Scotsman and the Glasgow Herald.[9]\\nHolmes was partially modelled on Doyle\\'s former university teacher Joseph Bell. In 1892, in a letter to Bell, Doyle wrote, \"It is most certainly to you that I owe Sherlock Holmes\\xa0... round the centre of deduction and inference and observation which I have heard you inculcate I have tried to build up a man\",[36] and in his 1924 autobiography, he remarked, \"It is no wonder that after the study of such a character [viz., Bell] I used and amplified his methods when in later life I tried to build up a scientific detective who solved cases on his own merits and not through the folly of the criminal.\"[37] Robert Louis Stevenson was able to recognise the strong similarity between Joseph Bell and Sherlock Holmes: \"My compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting adventures of Sherlock Holmes.\\xa0... can this be my old friend Joe Bell?\"[38] Other authors sometimes suggest additional influences—for instance, Edgar Allan Poe\\'s character C. Auguste Dupin, who is mentioned, disparagingly, by Holmes in A Study in Scarlet.[39] Dr. (John) Watson owes his surname, but not any other obvious characteristic, to a Portsmouth medical colleague of Doyle\\'s, Dr. James Watson.[40]\\nA sequel to A Study in Scarlet was commissioned, and The Sign of the Four appeared in Lippincott\\'s Magazine in February 1890, under agreement with the Ward Lock company. Doyle felt grievously exploited by Ward Lock as an author new to the publishing world, and so, after this, he left them.[9] Short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes were published in the Strand Magazine. Doyle wrote the first five Holmes short stories from his office at 2 Upper Wimpole Street (then known as Devonshire Place), which is now marked by a memorial plaque.[41]\\nDoyle\\'s attitude towards his most famous creation was ambivalent.[40] In November 1891, he wrote to his mother: \"I think of slaying Holmes,\\xa0... and winding him up for good and all. He takes my mind from better things.\" His mother responded, \"You won\\'t! You can\\'t! You mustn\\'t!\"[42] In an attempt to deflect publishers\\' demands for more Holmes stories, he raised his price to a level intended to discourage them, but found they were willing to pay even the large sums he asked.[40] As a result, he became one of the best-paid authors of his time.\\nIn December 1893, to dedicate more of his time to his historical novels, Doyle had Holmes and Professor Moriarty plunge to their deaths together down the Reichenbach Falls in the story \"The Final Problem\". Public outcry, however, led him to feature Holmes in 1901 in the novel The Hound of the Baskervilles. Holmes\\'s fictional connection with the Reichenbach Falls is celebrated in the nearby town of Meiringen.\\nIn 1903, Doyle published his first Holmes short story in ten years, \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", in which it was explained that only Moriarty had fallen, but since Holmes had other dangerous enemies—especially Colonel Sebastian Moran—he had arranged to make it look as if he too were dead. Holmes was ultimately featured in a total of 56 short stories—the last published in 1927—and four novels by Doyle, and has since appeared in many novels and stories by other authors.\\nDoyle\\'s first novels were The Mystery of Cloomber, not published until 1888, and the unfinished Narrative of John Smith, published only posthumously, in 2011.[43] He amassed a portfolio of short stories, including \"The Captain of the Pole-Star\" and \"J.\\xa0Habakuk Jephson\\'s Statement\", both inspired by Doyle\\'s time at sea. The latter popularised the mystery of the Mary Celeste[44] and added fictional details such as that the ship was found in perfect condition (it had actually taken on water by the time it was discovered), and that its boats remained on board (the single boat was in fact missing). These fictional details have come to dominate popular accounts of the incident,[9][44] and Doyle\\'s alternative spelling of the ship\\'s name as the Marie Celeste has become more commonly used than the original spelling.[45]\\nBetween 1888 and 1906, Doyle wrote seven historical novels, which he and many critics regarded as his best work.[40] He also wrote nine other novels, and—later in his career (1912–29)—five narratives (two of novel length) featuring the irascible scientist Professor Challenger. The Challenger stories include his best-known work after the Holmes oeuvre, The Lost World. His historical novels include The White Company and its prequel Sir Nigel, set in the Middle Ages. He was a prolific author of short stories, including two collections set in Napoleonic times and featuring the French character Brigadier Gerard.\\nDoyle\\'s works for the stage include Waterloo, which centres on the reminiscences of an English veteran of the Napoleonic Wars and features a character Gregory Brewster, written for Henry Irving; The House of Temperley, the plot of which reflects his abiding interest in boxing; The Speckled Band, adapted from his earlier short story \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\"; and an 1893 collaboration with J.\\xa0M. Barrie on the libretto of Jane Annie.[46]\\nWhile living in Southsea, the seaside resort near Portsmouth, Doyle played football as a goalkeeper for Portsmouth Association Football Club, an amateur side, under the pseudonym A. C. Smith.[47]\\nDoyle was a keen cricketer, and between 1899 and 1907 he played 10 first-class matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC).[48] He also played for the amateur cricket teams the Allahakbarries and the Authors XI alongside fellow writers J.\\xa0M. Barrie, P.\\xa0G. Wodehouse and A.\\xa0A. Milne.[49][50] His highest score, in 1902 against London County, was 43. He was an occasional bowler who took one first-class wicket, W.\\xa0G. Grace, and wrote a poem about the achievement.[51]\\nIn 1900, Doyle founded the Undershaw Rifle Club at his home, constructing a 100-yard range and providing shooting for local men, as the poor showing of British troops in the Boer War had led him to believe that the general population needed training in marksmanship.[52][53] He was a champion of \"miniature\" rifle clubs, whose members shot small-calibre firearms on local ranges.[54][55] These ranges were much cheaper and more accessible to working-class participants than large \"fullbore\" ranges, such as Bisley Camp, which were necessarily remote from population centres. Doyle went on to sit on the Rifle Clubs Committee of the National Rifle Association.[56]\\nIn 1901, Doyle was one of three judges for the world\\'s first major bodybuilding competition, which was organised by the \"Father of Bodybuilding\", Eugen Sandow. The event was held in London\\'s Royal Albert Hall. The other two judges were the sculptor Sir Charles Lawes-Wittewronge and Eugen Sandow himself.[57]\\nDoyle was an amateur boxer.[58] In 1909, he was invited to referee the James Jeffries–Jack Johnson heavyweight championship fight in Reno, Nevada. Doyle wrote: \"I was much inclined to accept\\xa0... though my friends pictured me as winding up with a revolver at one ear and a razor at the other. However, the distance and my engagements presented a final bar.\"[58]\\nAlso a keen golfer, Doyle was elected captain of the Crowborough Beacon Golf Club in Sussex for 1910. He had moved to Little Windlesham house in Crowborough with Jean Leckie, his second wife, and resided there with his family from 1907 until his death in July 1930.[59]\\nHe entered the English Amateur billiards championship in 1913.[60]\\nWhile living in Switzerland, Doyle became interested in skiing, which was relatively unknown in Switzerland at the time. He wrote an article, \"An Alpine Pass on \\'Ski\\'\" for the December 1894 issue of The Strand Magazine,[61] in which he described his experiences with skiing and the beautiful alpine scenery that could be seen in the process. The article popularised the activity and began the long association between Switzerland and skiing.[62]\\nIn 1885 Doyle married Louisa (sometimes called \"Touie\") Hawkins (1857–1906). She was the youngest daughter of J. Hawkins, of Minsterworth, Gloucestershire, and the sister of one of Doyle\\'s patients. Louisa had tuberculosis.[63] In 1907, the year after Louisa\\'s death, he married Jean Elizabeth Leckie (1874–1940). He had met and fallen in love with Jean in 1897, but had maintained a platonic relationship with her while his first wife was still alive, out of loyalty to her.[64] Jean outlived him by ten years, and died in London.[65]\\nDoyle fathered five children. He had two with his first wife: Mary Louise (1889–1976) and Arthur Alleyne Kingsley, known as Kingsley (1892–1918). He had an additional three with his second wife: Denis Percy Stewart (1909–1955), who became the second husband of Georgian Princess Nina Mdivani; Adrian Malcolm (1910–1970); and Jean Lena Annette (1912–1997).[66] None of Doyle\\'s five children had children of their own, so he has no living direct descendants.[67][68]\\nDoyle served as a volunteer physician in the Langman Field Hospital at Bloemfontein between March and June 1900,[69] during the Second Boer War in South Africa (1899–1902). Later that year, he wrote a book on the war, The Great Boer War, as well as a short work titled The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct, in which he responded to critics of the United Kingdom\\'s role in that war, and argued that its role was justified. The latter work was widely translated, and Doyle believed it was the reason he was knighted (given the rank of Knight Bachelor) by King Edward VII in the 1902 Coronation Honours.[70] He received the accolade from the King in person at Buckingham Palace on 24 October of that year.[71]\\nHe stood for Parliament twice as a Liberal Unionist: in 1900 in Edinburgh Central, and in 1906 in the Hawick Burghs, but was not elected.[72] He served as a Deputy-Lieutenant of Surrey beginning in 1902,[73] and was appointed a Knight of Grace of the Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem in 1903.[74]\\nDoyle was a supporter of the campaign for the reform of the Congo Free State that was led by the journalist E. D. Morel and diplomat Roger Casement. In 1909 he wrote The Crime of the Congo, a long pamphlet in which he denounced the horrors of that colony. He became acquainted with Morel and Casement, and it is possible that, together with Bertram Fletcher Robinson, they inspired several characters that appear in his 1912 novel The Lost World.[75] Later, after the Irish Easter Rising, Casement was found guilty of treason against the Crown, and was sentenced to death. Doyle tried, unsuccessfully, to save him, arguing that Casement had been driven mad, and therefore should not be held responsible for his actions.[76]\\nAs the First World War loomed, and having been caught up in a growing public swell of Germanophobia, Doyle gave a public donation of 10 shillings to the anti-immigration British Brothers\\' League.[77] In 1914, Doyle was one of fifty-three leading British authors—including H. G. Wells, Rudyard Kipling and Thomas Hardy—who signed their names to the \"Authors\\' Declaration\", justifying Britain\\'s involvement in the First World War. This manifesto declared that the German invasion of Belgium had been a brutal crime, and that Britain \"could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war\".[78]\\nDoyle was also a fervent advocate of justice and personally investigated two closed cases, which led to two men being exonerated of the crimes of which they were accused. The first case, in 1906, involved a shy half-British, half-Indian lawyer named George Edalji, who had allegedly penned threatening letters and mutilated animals in Great Wyrley. Police were set on Edalji\\'s conviction, even though the mutilations continued after their suspect was jailed.[79] Apart from helping George Edalji, Doyle\\'s work helped establish a way to correct other miscarriages of justice, as it was partially as a result of this case that the Court of Criminal Appeal was established in 1907.[80]\\nThe story of Doyle and Edalji was dramatised in an episode of the 1972 BBC television series, The Edwardians. In Nicholas Meyer\\'s pastiche The West End Horror (1976), Holmes manages to help clear the name of a shy Parsi Indian character wronged by the English justice system. Edalji was of Parsi heritage on his father\\'s side. The story was fictionalised in Julian Barnes\\'s 2005 novel Arthur and George, which was adapted into a three-part drama by ITV in 2015.[citation needed]\\nThe second case, that of Oscar Slater—a Jew of German origin who operated a gambling den and was convicted of bludgeoning an 82-year-old woman in Glasgow in 1908—excited Doyle\\'s curiosity because of inconsistencies in the prosecution\\'s case and a general sense that Slater was not guilty. He ended up paying most of the costs for Slater\\'s successful 1928 appeal.[81]\\nDoyle had a longstanding interest in mystical subjects and remained fascinated by the idea of paranormal phenomena, even though the strength of his belief in their reality waxed and waned periodically over the years.\\nIn 1887, in Southsea, influenced by Major-General Alfred Wilks Drayson, a member of the Portsmouth Literary and Philosophical Society, Doyle began a series of investigations into the possibility of psychic phenomena and attended about 20 seances, experiments in telepathy, and sittings with mediums. Writing to spiritualist journal Light that year, he declared himself to be a spiritualist, describing one particular event that had convinced him psychic phenomena were real.[82] Also in 1887 (on 26\\xa0January), he was initiated as a Freemason at the Phoenix Lodge No.\\xa0257 in Southsea. (He resigned from the Lodge in 1889, returned to it in 1902, and resigned again in 1911.)[83]\\nIn 1889, he became a founding member of the Hampshire Society for Psychical Research; in 1893, he joined the London-based Society for Psychical Research; and in 1894, he collaborated with Sir Sidney Scott and Frank Podmore in a search for poltergeists in Devon.[84]\\nDoyle and the spiritualist William Thomas Stead (before the latter was lost in the sinking of the Titanic) were led to believe that Julius and Agnes Zancig had genuine psychic powers, and they claimed publicly that the Zancigs used telepathy. However, in 1924, the Zancigs confessed that their mind reading act had been a trick; they published the secret code and all other details of the trick method they had used under the title \"Our Secrets!!\" in a London newspaper.[85] Doyle also praised the psychic phenomena and spirit materialisations that he believed had been produced by Eusapia Palladino and Mina Crandon, both of whom were also later exposed as frauds.[86]\\nIn 1916, at the height of the First World War, Doyle\\'s belief in psychic phenomena was strengthened by what he took to be the psychic abilities of his children\\'s nanny, Lily Loder Symonds.[87] This and the constant drumbeat of wartime deaths inspired him with the idea that spiritualism was what he called a \"New Revelation\"[88] sent by God to bring solace to the bereaved. He wrote a piece in Light magazine about his faith and began lecturing frequently on spiritualism. In 1918, he published his first spiritualist work, The New Revelation.\\nSome have mistakenly assumed that Doyle\\'s turn to spiritualism was prompted by the death of his son Kingsley, but Doyle began presenting himself publicly as a spiritualist in 1916, and Kingsley died on 28\\xa0October 1918 (from pneumonia contracted during his convalescence after being seriously wounded in the 1916 Battle of the Somme).[88] Nevertheless, the war-related deaths of many people who were close to him appears to have even further strengthened his long-held belief in life after death and spirit communication. Doyle\\'s brother Brigadier-general Innes Doyle died, also from pneumonia, in February 1919. His two brothers-in-law (one of whom was E.\\xa0W. Hornung, creator of the literary character Raffles), as well as his two nephews, also died shortly after the war. His second book on spiritualism, The Vital Message, appeared in 1919.\\nDoyle found solace in supporting spiritualism\\'s ideas and the attempts of spiritualists to find proof of an existence beyond the grave. In particular, according to some,[89] he favoured Christian Spiritualism and encouraged the Spiritualists\\' National Union to accept an eighth precept – that of following the teachings and example of Jesus of Nazareth. He was a member of the renowned supernaturalist organisation The Ghost Club.[90]\\nIn 1919, the magician P.\\xa0T. Selbit staged a séance at his flat in Bloomsbury, which Doyle attended. Although some later claimed that Doyle had endorsed the apparent instances of clairvoyance at that séance as genuine,[91][92] a contemporaneous report by the Sunday Express quoted Doyle as saying \"I should have to see it again before passing a definite opinion on it\" and \"I have my doubts about the whole thing\".[93] In 1920, Doyle and the noted sceptic Joseph McCabe held a public debate at Queen\\'s Hall in London, with Doyle taking the position that the claims of spiritualism were true. After the debate, McCabe published a booklet Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud?, in which he laid out evidence refuting Doyle\\'s arguments and claimed that Doyle had been duped into believing in spiritualism through deliberate mediumship trickery.[94]\\nDoyle also debated the psychiatrist Harold Dearden, who vehemently disagreed with Doyle\\'s belief that many cases of diagnosed mental illness were the result of spirit possession.[95]\\nIn 1920, Doyle travelled to Australia and New Zealand on spiritualist missionary work, and over the next several years, until his death, he continued his mission, giving talks about his spiritualist conviction in Britain, Europe, and the United States.[84]\\nDoyle wrote a novel The Land of Mist centred on spiritualist themes and featuring the character Professor Challenger. He also wrote many non-fiction spiritualist works. Perhaps his most famous of these was The Coming of the Fairies (1922),[96] in which Doyle described his beliefs about the nature and existence of fairies and spirits, reproduced the five Cottingley Fairies photographs, asserted that those who suspected them being faked were wrong, and expressed his conviction that they were authentic. Decades later, the photos—taken by cousins Frances Griffiths and Elsie Wright—were definitively shown to have been faked, and their creators admitted to the fakery, although both maintained that they really had seen fairies.[97]\\nDoyle was friends for a time with the American magician Harry Houdini. Even though Houdini explained that his feats were based on illusion and trickery, Doyle was convinced that Houdini had supernatural powers and said as much in his work The Edge of the Unknown. Houdini\\'s friend Bernard M.\\xa0L. Ernst recounted a time when Houdini had performed an impressive trick at his home in Doyle\\'s presence. Houdini had assured Doyle that the trick was pure illusion and had expressed the hope that this demonstration would persuade Doyle not to go around \"endorsing phenomena\" simply because he could think of no explanation for what he had seen other than supernatural power. However, according to Ernst, Doyle simply refused to believe that it had been a trick.[98] Houdini became a prominent opponent of the spiritualist movement in the 1920s, after the death of his beloved mother. He insisted that spiritualist mediums employed trickery, and consistently exposed them as frauds. These differences between Houdini and Doyle eventually led to a bitter, public falling-out between them.[99]\\nIn 1922, the psychical researcher Harry Price accused the \"spirit photographer\" William Hope of fraud. Doyle defended Hope, but further evidence of trickery was obtained from other researchers.[100] Doyle threatened to have Price evicted from the National Laboratory of Psychical Research and predicted that, if he persisted in writing what he called \"sewage\" about spiritualists, he would meet the same fate as Harry Houdini.[101] Price wrote: \"Arthur Conan Doyle and his friends abused me for years for exposing Hope.\"[102] In response to the exposure of frauds that had been perpetrated by Hope and other spiritualists, Doyle led 84 members of the Society for Psychical Research to resign in protest from the society on the ground that they believed it was opposed to spiritualism.[103]\\nDoyle\\'s two-volume book The History of Spiritualism was published in 1926. W. Leslie Curnow a spiritualist, contributed much research to the book.[104][105] Later that year, Robert John Tillyard wrote a predominantly supportive review of it in the journal Nature.[106] This review provoked controversy: Several other critics, notably A.\\xa0A. Campbell Swinton, pointed out the evidence of fraud in mediumship, as well as Doyle\\'s non-scientific approach to the subject.[107][108][109] In 1927, Doyle gave a filmed interview, in which he spoke about Sherlock Holmes and spiritualism.[110]\\nRichard Milner, an American historian of science, argued that Doyle may have been the perpetrator of the Piltdown Man hoax of 1912, creating the counterfeit hominid fossil that fooled the scientific world for over 40\\xa0years. Milner noted that Doyle had a plausible motive—namely, revenge on the scientific establishment for debunking one of his favourite psychics—and said that The Lost World appeared to contain several clues referring cryptically to his having been involved in the hoax.[111][112] Samuel Rosenberg\\'s 1974 book Naked Is the Best Disguise purports to explain how, throughout his writings, Doyle had provided overt clues to otherwise hidden or suppressed aspects of his way of thinking that seemed to support the idea that Doyle would be involved in such a hoax.[113]\\nHowever, more recent research suggests that Doyle was not involved. In 2016, researchers at the Natural History Museum and Liverpool John Moores University analyzed DNA evidence showing that responsibility for the hoax lay with the amateur archaeologist Charles Dawson, who had originally \"found\" the remains. He had initially not been considered the likely perpetrator, because the hoax was seen as being too elaborate for him to have devised. However, the DNA evidence showed that a supposedly ancient tooth he had \"discovered\" in 1915 (at a different site) came from the same jaw as that of the Piltdown Man, suggesting that he had planted them both. That tooth, too, was later proven to have been planted as part of a hoax.[114]\\nChris Stringer, an anthropologist from the Natural History Museum, was quoted as saying: \"Conan Doyle was known to play golf at the Piltdown site and had even given Dawson a lift in his car to the area, but he was a public man and very busy[,] and it is very unlikely that he would have had the time [to create the hoax]. So there are some coincidences, but I think they are just coincidences. When you look at the fossil evidence[,] you can only associate Dawson with all the finds, and Dawson was known to be personally ambitious. He wanted professional recognition. He wanted to be a member of the Royal Society and he was after an MBE [sic[115]]. He wanted people to stop seeing him as an amateur\".[116]\\nAnother of Doyle\\'s longstanding interests was architectural design. In 1895, when he commissioned an architect friend of his, Joseph Henry Ball, to build him a home, he played an active part in the design process.[117][118] The home in which he lived from October 1897 to September 1907, known as Undershaw (near Hindhead, in Surrey),[119] was used as a hotel and restaurant from 1924 until 2004, when it was bought by a developer and then stood empty while conservationists and Doyle fans fought to preserve it.[63] In 2012, the High Court in London ruled in favor of those seeking to preserve the historic building, ordering that the redevelopment permission be quashed on the ground that it had not been obtained through proper procedures.[120] The building was later approved to become part of Stepping Stones, a school for children with disabilities and special needs.\\nDoyle made his most ambitious foray into architecture in March 1912, while he was staying at the Lyndhurst Grand Hotel: He sketched the original designs for a third-storey extension and for an alteration of the front facade of the building.[121] Work began later that year, and when it was finished, the building was a nearly exact manifestation of the plans Doyle had sketched. Superficial alterations have been subsequently made, but the essential structure is still clearly Doyle\\'s.[122]\\nIn 1914, on a family trip to the Jasper National Park in Canada, he designed a golf course and ancillary buildings for a hotel. The plans were realised in full, but neither the golf course nor the buildings have survived.[123]\\nIn 1926, Doyle laid the foundation stone for a Spiritualist Temple in Camden, London. Of the building\\'s total £600 construction costs, he provided £500.[124]\\nThe Crimes Club was a private social club founded by Doyle in 1903, whose purpose was discussion of crime and detection, criminals and criminology, and continues to this day as \"Our Society\", with membership numbers limited to 100. The club meets four times a year at the Imperial Hotel, Russell Square, London, where all proceedings are strictly confidential (\"Chatham House rules\"). Its logo is a silhouette of Doyle.[125]\\nThe club\\'s earliest members included John Churton Collins, Japanologist Arthur Diósy, Sir Edward Marshall Hall, Sir Travers Humphreys, H. B. Irving, author (Thou Shalt Do No Murder) Arthur Lambton, William Le Queux, A. E. W. Mason, coroner Ingleby Oddie, Sir Max Pemberton, Bertram Fletcher Robinson, George R. Sims, Sir Bernard Spilsbury, Sir P. G. Wodehouse, and Filson Young.[126]\\nDoyle was found clutching his chest in the hall of Windlesham Manor, his house in Crowborough, Sussex, on 7 July 1930. He died of a heart attack at the age of 71. His last words were directed toward his wife: \"You are wonderful.\"[127] At the time of his death, there was some controversy concerning his burial place, as he was avowedly not a Christian, considering himself a Spiritualist. He was first buried on 11 July 1930 in Windlesham rose garden. In his will, he bequeathed £250 per year to Alfred Wood, who had served as his private secretary since 1897.[128]\\nHe was later reinterred together with his wife in Minstead churchyard in the New Forest, Hampshire.[9] Carved wooden tablets to his memory and to the memory of his wife, originally from the church at Minstead, are on display as part of a Sherlock Holmes exhibition at Portsmouth Museum.[129][130] The epitaph on his gravestone in the churchyard reads, in part: \"Steel true/Blade straight/Arthur Conan Doyle/Knight/Patriot, Physician and man of letters\".[131]\\nA statue honours Doyle at Crowborough Cross in Crowborough, where he lived for 23 years.[132] There is a statue of Sherlock Holmes in Picardy Place, Edinburgh, close to the house where Doyle was born.[133]\\nDoyle has been commemorated with statues and plaques since his death. In 2009, he was among the ten people selected by the Royal Mail for their \"Eminent Britons\" commemorative postage stamp issue.[134]\\nArthur Conan Doyle has been portrayed by many actors, including:\\nArthur Conan Doyle is the ostensible narrator of Ian Madden\\'s short story \"Cracks in an Edifice of Sheer Reason\".[146]\\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle features as a recurring character in Pip Murphy\\'s Christie and Agatha\\'s Detective Agency series, including A Discovery Disappears[147] and Of Mountains and Motors.[148]\\nDigital collections\\nPhysical collections\\nBiographical information\\nOther references\\n',\n",

After she graduated, she earned an actor\\'s equity card and moved to Tokyo, Japan. In Tokyo, she worked as an English teacher and nightclub hostess for six months, before returning home through Southeast Asia.[6]\\nShe worked at BBC Radio 4 for two years in London,[5] producing its then arts magazine Kaleidoscope,[6] before travelling again, this time overland through North, Central and South America, a trip that became research material for her first solo novel Snow Storms in Hot Climate (1988), a thriller about the early cocaine trade in Colombia.[7]\\nShe went on to work extensively in radio and television, most notably as a presenter of BBC2\\'s late night live arts programme, The Late Show in the 1990s[6] and Night Waves, BBC Radio 3\\'s nightly cultural discussion programme.\\nShe contributes regularly to radio, and is an occasional presenter for BBC Radio 4\\'s opinion slot \"Point of View\".[8]\\nDunant started writing in her late twenties, first with a friend, with whom she produced two political thrillers and a five-part BBC1 drama series - Thin Air, starring Kate Hardie, Nicky Henson and Clive Merrison, broadcast in 1988 - before going solo.[citation needed]\\nHer eleven subsequent novels have explored two genres: contemporary thrillers and historical fiction. What unites the two is her decision to use avowedly popular forms, characterised by compelling storytelling, as a way to explore serious subject matter and reach large audiences. This has included (though not exclusively) a passionate commitment to feminism and the role of women inside history.[citation needed]\\nIn the 1990s, she wrote a trilogy around a British female private eye Hannah Wolfe, spotlighting issues like surrogacy, cosmetic surgery, animal rights, and violence to women. Sexual violence was also at the centre of Transgressions (based on a mysterious series of incidents happening in her house[9] which tackled what might happen if a woman woke to an intruder in her house and live to tell the tale. The resulting furore over the actions of the heroine \"caused the book to become a cause celebre which triggered a debate about rape and popular culture\".[10]\\nIn 2000, an extended visit to Florence changed her working life. In what she acknowledged was something of a midlife crisis,[11] her old passion for history was reignited, and she started to research the impact of the Renaissance on the city in the 1490s. The result was The Birth of Venus,[12] the first of a trilogy of novels about women\\'s lives in the Italian Renaissance. The commercial success of these books in America and elsewhere[13][14] allowed Dunant to devote herself full time to writing and research, concentrating on the most current work being done in Renaissance studies, most particularly concerning the lives of women.[15] The novel Sacred Hearts, a story of nuns in an enclosed convent in 16th century Ferrara, led to collaboration with the early music group, Musica Secreta: a theatrical adaptation using the music of the period and with a choir, performed in churches and at early music festivals around Britain.[citation needed]\\nSince then, she has been working on the history of the Borgia family, seeking to separate the colorful historical truth from the smear and gossip that built up during their lives, and in history after their deaths.[14] It has made her a passionate advocate for better historical accuracy in popular TV series like The Borgias.[16]\\nAs a journalist she has reviewed for many UK newspapers, edited two books of essays on political correctness and millennial anxieties, and currently reviews for the New York Times.[citation needed]\\nHer crime novels were three times shortlisted for the CWA Golden dagger award, and in 1994 she won a silver dagger for Fatlands.[16]\\nIn 2010 Sacred Hearts was shortlisted for the first Walter Scott Historical Fiction Prize, an award which highlighted the growing power and popularity of the form.[17][18]\\nShe is an accredited lecturer for NADFAS the UK arts charity, which promotes education and appreciation of fine arts.[19]\\nIn 2016, she was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters from Oxford Brookes University, where she is a guest lecturer on the Creative writing M.A. course.[20]\\nIn her journalism and public speaking, she is a feminist, and an advocate for legalisation of marijuana.[21][22] A Catholic by birth, she has also written about the importance of religion in history and the need for Catholicism to reform itself.[13]\\n\\n',\n",

He was known for his reference books on old-time radio and his series of mysteries featuring Denver bookseller and ex-policeman Cliff Janeway.\\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, in 1942, Dunning moved to his father\\'s hometown of Charleston, South Carolina, at the age of three. In 1964 he left his parents\\' home and moved to Denver, Colorado, where, after a time working as a stable hand at a horse racing track, he got a job at The Denver Post. In 1970 he left the newspaper and took up writing novels, while pursuing a variety of jobs. Partly because of trouble with his publishers, in 1984 he stopped writing and opened a store specializing in second-hand and rare books called the Old Algonquin Bookstore.[1][2] At the urging of fellow authors, he returned to the world of novels in 1992 with his first Cliff Janeway novel, Booked to Die. In 1994 he closed the store and continued it as an internet and mail order business called Old Algonquin Books.[3]\\nIn addition to compiling encyclopedic reference books about the history of radio programming, Dunning hosted a long-running weekly radio show, Old-Time Radio.[4]\\nDunning received his first award nomination in 1981, when Looking for Ginger North received an Edgar Award nomination for \"Best Paperback Original\".[5] The following year, Deadline was nominated for this same honour.[5]\\nDunning\\'s novel Booked to Die won the Nero Award and was nominated for the 1993 Anthony Award in the \"Best Novel\" category.[6][7] The follow-up to this novel, The Bookman\\'s Wake, was nominated for the 1996 Edgar Award in the \"Best Novel\" running.[8]\\nOn May 30, 1969, Dunning married Helen Rose Korupp.[9]\\nDunning died on May 23, 2023, at the age of 81, following a long battle with dementia, stemming from a brain tumor diagnosed in 2006.[10]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nFrancis Henry Durbridge (listenⓘ; 25 November 1912\\xa0– 11 April 1998)[1] was an English dramatist and author, best known for the creation of the character Paul Temple, the gentlemanly detective who appeared in 16 BBC multi-part radio serials from 1938 onward.[2]\\nDurbridge was born in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, and educated at Bradford Grammar School, where he was encouraged to write by his English teacher. He continued to do so while studying English at the University of Birmingham. After graduating in 1933, he worked for a short time as a stockbroker\\'s clerk before selling a radio play, Promotion, to the BBC at the age of 21.[3]\\nDurbridge created the character of Paul Temple, a crime novelist and detective, in the 1930s. With Steve Trent, a Fleet Street journalist who would later become his wife, Temple solved numerous crimes in the glamorous world of the leisured middle classes, at first on radio. In addition to the Paul Temple series, Durbridge wrote other mysteries for radio and television, many of which were also produced for Dutch, German and Italian television and radio.[4]\\nDurbridge also forged a successful career as a writer for the stage with seven plays, the last of which, Sweet Revenge, was written in 1991. He also wrote forty-three novels, many of which were adapted from his scripts, sometimes with the help of others.[5]\\nDurbridge wrote twenty Paul Temple serials for radio. The first was Send for Paul Temple, broadcast in eight episodes on the BBC Midland Regional Programme from 8 April 1938. Hugh Morton played Paul, and Steve was played by Bernadette Hodgson. Carl Bernard took over the part of Paul in 1939. Peter Coke took over the part from the 1954 serial, Paul Temple and the Gilbert Case, onwards.[6][7]\\nMarjorie Westbury took over the part of Steve from the fifth serial, Send for Paul Temple Again (1945). She remained as Steve for the rest of the radio run. To many people, Coke and Westbury are most firmly identified with Paul and Steve.[8]\\nThe original signature tune was taken from Scheherazade by Rimsky-Korsakov, with incidental music taken from the works of other composers, including Tintagel by Sir Arnold Bax. The signature tune was later changed to Coronation Scot by Vivian Ellis. The BBC licensed the serials to broadcasters in Commonwealth countries, where they were transmitted long after their original runs in the UK.\\nIn the 1960s, German radio adapted twelve Paul Temple serials. Like the BBC originals, each part ended with a cliffhanger, making them Strassenfeger (\"street-clearers\"), which were so popular as to leave the streets deserted. The actors were of national renown, with Paul Temple played by Luxembourg-born René Deltgen, and supported by Gustav Knuth, Paul Klinger and others. All of these German radio serials are, like the BBC originals, available on CD.[9][10]\\nThe European Broadcasting Union invited Durbridge in 1967 to write an original radio serial for the international market, La Boutique. This was broadcast in more than fifteen countries.\\nBetween 1952 and 1980, Durbridge wrote 17 TV serials for the BBC. Until 1959, they were shown under the umbrella title A Francis Durbridge Serial, which was then changed to Francis Durbridge Presents.[11] Versions were also made in the Netherlands, Italy, France and Germany, some serials were re-made in the 1980s and 1990s.\\nThe Scarf was a six-part serial starring Stephen Murray and Donald Pleasence, and was aired by the BBC in February and March 1959. The theme music was The Girl from Corsica by Trevor Duncan. There were objections in Germany in 1962 when comedian Wolfgang Neuss revealed in a newspaper who would turn out to be the murderer in the last episode of a German version called Das Halstuch\\xa0[de].[12]\\nIn 1960–61, The World of Tim Frazer was broadcast as an 18-episode serial featuring three adventures [1] with Jack Hedley in the title role. They attracted almost 80% of all TV viewers—partly because, at that time, many European countries had one TV station each.[13]\\nIn the sixties and seventies, many mini-series adapted from Durbridge\\'s works were produced in Italy by RAI-TV. They featured some of the best Italian actors, among them Aroldo Tieri, Giuliana Lojodice, Nando Gazzolo, Ugo Pagliai, Luigi Vannucchi, Alberto Lupo and Rossano Brazzi. In France, TV scriptwriter and director Abder Isker produced some of Durbridge\\'s adaptations for ORTF.\\nIn the mid-1960s, mini-series based on the Paul Temple novels appeared on TV in Europe.[14]\\nThe 1969–1971 television series Paul Temple ran for 52 episodes over four seasons, with the last 39 episodes (seasons 2–4) being the first international television co-production, made by the BBC with Taurus Films of Munich, West Germany. Paul Temple was played by British actor Francis Matthews, with Ros Drinkwater playing Steve.[15][16]\\nDurbridge wrote many Paul Temple novels, but mostly worked with a co-author because Durbridge regarded himself as a writer of dialogue, a scriptwriter rather than a novelist.[17] The first was Send for Paul Temple (1938), written in collaboration with the pseudonymous John Thewes. He is thought to have been Charles Hatton, with whom Durbridge collaborated on the following four Temple novelisations up until 1948.[17] All of these were rapidly adapted from Durbridge\\'s original radio scripts in order to capitalise on the popularity of the radio serial. Publicity for Send for Paul Temple described it as \"the novel of the thriller that created a BBC fan-mail record\".\\nThe two novels with Douglas Rutherford (The Tyler Mystery, 1957 and East of Algiers, 1959) appeared under the Paul Temple pen name. The Tyler Mystery is unusual in giving Temple\\'s wife Steve a more central role. East of Algiers was partly based on the 1947 radio serial Paul Temple and the Sullivan Mystery. From The Kelby Affair (1970) on the novels are credited to Francis Durbridge alone.\\nDurbridge wrote three Tim Frazer novels: The World of Tim Frazer (1962), Tim Frazer Again (1964) and Tim Frazer Gets the Message (1978).[18] Beware of Johnny Washington (1951, reissued by HarperCollins in 2017)[19] was a substantially re-written version of the first Paul Temple novel, Send for Paul Temple and there were three others based on Paul Temple scripts that were recycled as non-Temple books.[17] Two titles, Back Room Girl (1950) and The Pig-Tail Murder (1969) were written as original novels, but most of the later books were adapted from the television plays of the 1960s and 1970s.\\nDurbridge married Norah Lawley in 1940. They had two sons. He died at his home in Barnes, London, aged 85, in 1998.[5]\\nThe dates given are those of the first broadcast (and, in the case of serials, of the first episode):[20]\\nNone of the episodes of The Francis Durbridge Serial are believed to have survived.[21] All episodes of Francis Durbridge Presents survive except for The World of Tim Frazer of which only episode 3 and 10 (out of 18) are thought to still exist.[22]\\nIn 1997, Channel 4 broadcast a version of Melissa, adapted by Alan Bleasdale from the Francis Durbridge novel.

       " 'Clifford Martin Eddy Jr. (C. M. Eddy Jr.; January 18, 1896 – November 21, 1967)[1] was an American writer known for his horror, mystery and supernatural short stories. He is best remembered for his work in Weird Tales magazine and his friendship with H. P. Lovecraft.\\n\\nEddy was born in Providence, Rhode Island, on January 18, 1896. He went to Classical High School in Providence,[2] and as a child was a precocious reader and writer. He continued to be an avid reader and writer, interested in mythology and the occult. According to his wife Muriel, Cliff was always interested in the idea of parallel planes—where life on another level, either astral or otherwise, would be similar to that on earth—or where life might exist, but in another time or another form. He was also fascinated by the themes of teleportation, vampirism, ghosts and the mystery of unexplained phenomena...he spent hours in the library researching the unusual, the unique, the bizarre.[3]He began his career writing short stories for a broad range of pulp fiction magazines such as Weird Tales, Munsey\\'s Magazine, and Snappy Stories. His first published tale, \"Sign of the Dragon\" (Mystery Magazine,[4] 1919), was a detective story. (In October 2012 it was released as a standalone e-book.)\\nVarious tales of mystery, ghosts, and song-writing (he himself wrote songs, including \"When We Met by the Blue Lagoon\", \"In My Wonderful Temple of Love\", \"Dearest of All\", \"Underneath the Whispering Pine\", \"Sunset Hour\", and \"Hello Mister Sunshine (Goodbye, Mister Rain)\"), continued to appear through 1925 in various magazines. They included \"A Little Bit of Good Luck\" (a story about songwriting), Munsey\\'s Magazine, 1920; \"Moonshine\" (ghost story), Action Stories, 1922; \"The Unshorn Lamb (another story about songwriting) Snappy Stories, 1922. Some stories written at this time were unpublished: \"Pilgrimage of Peril\", \"The Vengeful Vision\" and \"A Solitary Solution\" (all 1924) until collected in Exit Into Eternity (1973).\\nThe Eddys\\' first contact with H. P. Lovecraft occurred as early as 1918;[5] They first met face to face in August 1923, according to Muriel Eddy being introduced by Eddy\\'s and Lovecraft\\'s mothers,who were both active in the women\\'s suffrage movement.[3]\\nLovecraft frequently visited the Eddys\\' home on Second Street in East Providence, and later called on them at their home in the Fox Point section of Providence. Eddy was a member of Lovecraft\\'s inner circle of friends and authors, and he and Lovecraft edited each other\\'s works.[2] Both authors were also investigators for Harry Houdini and served the magician as ghostwriters. The two collaborated on The Cancer of Superstition, ghostwritten for Houdini, but the latter\\'s death in October 1926 curtailed the project. (Notes and surviving fragments were published in The Dark Brotherhood and Other Pieces.)\\nEddy and Lovecraft took scenic walks, including one to the Old Stone Mill in Newport, Rhode Island; August Derleth later incorporated notes taken by Lovecraft on this occasion into The Lurker at the Threshold (1945).\\nEddy\\'s wife Muriel typed many of Lovecraft\\'s manuscripts and Lovecraft would often read the stories to the couple. Eddy wrote several stories that were published in Weird Tales during 1924 and 1925. These were \"The Ghost Eater\" (a werewolf tale), 1924; \"The Loved Dead\" (about demoniac desire for the dead i.e. necrophilia), 1924; and \"Deaf, Dumb and Blind\", a chronicle of Satanic sensations, 1925. Lovecraft\\'s contribution seems to have ranged from making suggestions and perhaps a paragraph change. These tales are collected in The Loved Dead and Other Tales.\\nOther stories by Eddy which appeared in Weird Tales during 1924 and 1925 were \"Ashes\" (an experiment by a chemistry professor), 1924; \"With Weapons of Stone\" (a story of prehistoric man), 1924; \"Arhl-a of the Caves\" (another prehistoric man tale); and \"The Better Choice\" (about a machine for reviving the dead), 1925.[3] These tales are also included in The Loved Dead and Other Tales (Fenham Publishing, Narragansett, RI 2008)\\nOn 4 November 1923, Eddy and Lovecraft sought the Dark Swamp, a place of which Lovecraft had heard rumours and which was said to lie \"off the Putnam Pike, about halfway between Chepachet, Rhode Island and Putnam, Connecticut\".[6][7] The legend surrounding the place (which they never found) seems to have influenced the opening of Lovecraft\\'s story \"The Colour Out of Space\" (1927).\\nThe Dark Swamp was also the basis for Eddy\\'s unfinished short story \"Black Noon\" (1967) (posthumously published in Exit into Eternity: Tales of the Bizarre and Supernatural, see below). The introduction to Exit Into Eternity explains that Eddy was unable to complete the work due to illness, and died in 1967; also that August Derleth was intending to finish this work, and perhaps expand it into a full-length novel, but it remained unfinished due to Derleth\\'s death in 1971.[8] \"Black Noon\"\\'s protagonist is a pipe-smoking businessman called Biff Briggs (standing in for Eddy himself  – \\'Biff\\' instead of \\'Cliff\\') who reads pulp magazines in his spare time. After discovering the work of a superb horror writer named Robert Otis Mather (a thinly veiled fictitious version of H. P. Lovecraft) in the new pulp Uncanny Stories and finding he lives in the same town, Briggs befriends him and becomes a frequent visitor to Mathers\\' house at 31 Spring Lane, Fenham. (This fictitious town was invented by Eddy and is featured in \"The Loved Dead\" (1923) and \"Deaf, Dumb and Blind\" (1924). Mathers (known as Rom for short, due to his initials), is partly cared for by his aunt, Agatha Sessions. Mathers writes a trilogy of novels which seem to have taken him over almost by demonic possession. In the summer, Rom wants to investigate a town called Granville, which is reputed to have numerous haunted houses, and calls on Briggs to transport him. Over a period of two weeks they hold nightly vigils awaiting supernatural manifestations; while no ghosts appear, Rom\\'s life is nearly ended several times by seemingly unnatural accidents.\\nThere is a published letter by Eddy on his relationship with Lovecraft.[9]\\nEddy was also a theatrical booking agent for 25 years, promoting shows that featured many famous vaudevillians and performers of the early twentieth century. In later years, he was a proofreader for Oxford Press, a principal clerk at the business management office of the Rhode Island State Department of Public Health, secretary treasurer of the Rhode Island Theatrical Booking Agents\\' Association, and president (1954–1956) and treasurer (1962–67) of the Rhode Island Writers\\' Guild.[2] He died on November 21, 1967, aged 71, and is interred at Swan Point Cemetery.[1]\\nEddy\\'s grandson Jim Dyer set up Fenham Publishing in Narragansett, Rhode Island, in 2000 to publish the works of his grandparents Clifford M. and Muriel E. Eddy.[10]\\n',\n",
       " 'Tarō Hirai (平井 太郎, Hirai Tarō, October 21, 1894\\xa0– July 28, 1965), better known by the pen name Edogawa Ranpo (江戸川 乱歩)[a] was a Japanese author and critic who played a major role in the development of Japanese mystery and thriller fiction.  Many of his novels involve the detective hero Kogoro Akechi, who in later books was the leader of a group of boy detectives known as the \"Boy Detectives Club\" (少年探偵団, Shōnen tantei dan).\\nRanpo was an admirer of Western mystery writers, and especially of Edgar Allan Poe.  His pen name is a rendering of Poe\\'s name.[2]  Other authors who were special influences on him were Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, whom he attempted to translate into Japanese during his days as a student at Waseda University, and the Japanese mystery writer Ruikō Kuroiwa.\\nTarō Hirai was born in Nabari, Mie Prefecture in 1894, where his grandfather had been a samurai in the service of Tsu Domain. His father was a merchant, who had also practiced law. The family moved to what is now Kameyama, Mie, and from there to Nagoya when he was age two. At the age of 17, he studied economics at Waseda University in Tokyo starting in 1912. After graduating in 1916 with a degree in economics, he worked a series of odd jobs, including newspaper editing, drawing cartoons for magazine publications, selling soba noodles as a street vendor, and working in a used bookstore.\\nIn 1923, he made his literary debut by publishing the mystery story \"The Two-Sen Copper Coin\" (二銭銅貨, Ni-sen dōka) under the pen name \"Edogawa Ranpo\" (pronounced quickly, this humorous pseudonym sounds much like the name of the American pioneer of detective fiction, Edgar Allan Poe, whom he admired). The story appeared in the magazine Shin Seinen, a popular magazine written largely for an adolescent audience. Shin Seinen had previously published stories by a variety of Western authors including Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, and G. K. Chesterton, but this was the first time the magazine published a major piece of mystery fiction by a Japanese author. Some, such as James B. Harris (Ranpo\\'s first translator into English), have erroneously called this the first piece of modern mystery fiction by a Japanese writer,[3] but well before Ranpo entered the literary scene in 1923, a number of other modern Japanese authors such as Ruikō Kuroiwa, Kidō Okamoto, Jun\\'ichirō Tanizaki, Haruo Satō, and Kaita Murayama had incorporated elements of sleuthing, mystery, and crime within stories involving adventure, intrigue, the bizarre, and the grotesque.[4] What struck critics as new about Ranpo\\'s debut story \"The Two-Sen Copper Coin\" was that it focused on the logical process of ratiocination used to solve a mystery within a story that is closely related to Japanese culture.[5] The story involves an extensive description of an ingenious code based on a Buddhist chant known as the \"nenbutsu\" as well as Japanese-language Braille.[6]\\nOver the course of the next several years, Edogawa went on to write a number of other stories that focus on crimes and the processes involved in solving them. Among these stories are a number of stories that are now considered classics of early 20th-century Japanese popular literature: \"The Case of the Murder on D. Hill\" (D坂の殺人事件, D-zaka no satsujin jiken, January 1925), which is about a woman who is killed in the course of a sadomasochistic extramarital affair,[7] \"The Stalker in the Attic\" (屋根裏の散歩者, Yane-ura no Sanposha, August 1925), which is about a man who kills a neighbor in a Tokyo boarding house by dropping poison through a hole in the attic floor into his mouth,[8] and \"The Human Chair\" (人間椅子, Ningen Isu, October 1925), which is about a man who hides himself in a chair to feel the bodies on top of him.[9] Mirrors, lenses, and other optical devices appear in many of Edogawa\\'s other early stories, such as \"The Hell of Mirrors\".[9]\\nAlthough many of his first stories were primarily about sleuthing and the processes used in solving seemingly insolvable crimes, during the 1930s, he began to turn increasingly to stories that involved a combination of sensibilities often called \"ero guro nansensu\", from the three words \"eroticism, grotesquerie, and the nonsensical\".[10] The presence of these sensibilities helped him sell his stories to the public, which was increasingly eager to read his work. One finds in these stories a frequent tendency to incorporate elements of what the Japanese at that time called \"abnormal sexuality\" (変態性欲, hentai seiyoku). For instance, a major portion of the plot of the novel The Demon of the Lonely Isle (孤島の鬼, Kotō no oni), serialized from January 1929 to February 1930 in the journal Morning Sun (朝日, Asahi), involves a homosexual doctor and his infatuation for another main character.[11]\\nBy the 1930s, Edogawa was writing regularly for a number of major public journals of popular literature, and he had emerged as the foremost voice of Japanese mystery fiction. The detective hero Kogorō Akechi, who had first appeared in the story \"The Case of the Murder on D. Hill\" became a regular feature in his stories, a number of which pitted him against a dastardly criminal known as the Fiend with Twenty Faces (怪人二十面相, Kaijin ni-jū mensō), who had an incredible ability to disguise himself and move throughout society. (A number of these novels were subsequently made into films.) The 1930 novel introduced the adolescent Kobayashi Yoshio (小林芳雄) as Kogoro\\'s sidekick, and in the period after World War II, Edogawa wrote a number of novels for young readers that involved Kogoro and Kobayashi as the leaders of a group of young sleuths called the \"Boy Detectives Club\" (少年探偵団, Shōnen tantei dan). These works were wildly popular and are still read by many young Japanese readers, much like the Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew mysteries are popular mysteries for adolescents in the English-speaking world.\\nIn 1939, two years after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Edogawa was ordered by government censors to drop his story \"The Caterpillar\" (芋虫, Imo Mushi), which he had published without incident a few years before, from a collection of his short stories that the publisher Shun\\'yōdō was reprinting. \"The Caterpillar\" is about a veteran who was turned into a quadriplegic and so disfigured by war that he was little more than a human \"caterpillar\", unable to talk, move, or live by himself. Censors banned the story, apparently believing that the story would detract from the current war effort. This came as a blow to Ranpo, who relied on royalties from reprints for income. (The short story inspired director Kōji Wakamatsu, who drew from it his movie Caterpillar, which competed for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival.[12])\\nOver the course of World War II, especially during the full-fledged war between Japan and the US that began in 1941, Edogawa was active in his local neighborhood organization, and he wrote a number of stories about young detectives and sleuths that might be seen as in line with the war effort, but he wrote most of these under different pseudonyms as if to disassociate them with his legacy. In February 1945, his family was evacuated from their home in Ikebukuro, Tokyo to Fukushima in northern Japan. Edogawa remained until June, when he was suffering from malnutrition. Much of Ikebukuro was destroyed in Allied air raids and the subsequent fires that broke out in the city, but the thick, earthen-walled warehouse which he used as his studio was spared, and still stands to this day beside the campus of Rikkyo University.\\nIn the postwar period, Edogawa dedicated a great deal of energy to promoting mystery fiction, both in terms of the understanding of its history and encouraging the production of new mystery fiction. In 1946, he put his support behind a new journal called Jewels (宝石, Hōseki) dedicated to mystery fiction, and in 1947, he founded the Detective Author\\'s Club (探偵作家クラブ, Tantei sakka kurabu), which changed its name in 1963 to the Mystery Writers of Japan (日本推理作家協会, Nihon Suiri Sakka Kyōkai). In addition, he wrote a large number of articles about the history of Japanese, European, and American mystery fiction. Many of these essays were published in book form. Other than essays, much of his postwar literary production consisted largely of novels for juvenile readers featuring Kogorō Akechi and the Boy Detectives Club.\\nIn the 1950s, he and a bilingual translator collaborated for five years on a translation of Edogawa\\'s works into English, published as Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination by Tuttle. Since the translator could speak but not read Japanese, and Edogawa could read but not write English, the translation was done aurally, with Edogawa reading each sentence aloud, then checking the written English.[3]\\nAnother of his interests, especially during the late 1940s and 1950s, was bringing attention to the work of his dear friend Jun\\'ichi Iwata (1900–1945), an anthropologist who had spent many years researching the history of homosexuality in Japan. During the 1930s, Edogawa and Iwata had engaged in a light-hearted competition to see who could find the most books about erotic desire between men. Edogawa dedicated himself to finding books published in the West and Iwata dedicated himself to finding books having to do with Japan. Iwata died in 1945, with only part of his work published, so Edogawa worked to have the remaining work on queer historiography published.[13]\\nIn the postwar period, a large number of Edogawa\\'s books were made into films. The interest in using Edogawa\\'s literature as a departure point for creating films has continued well after his death. Edogawa, who had a variety of health issues, including atherosclerosis and Parkinson\\'s disease, died from a cerebral hemorrhage at his home in 1965. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Fuchu, near Tokyo.\\nThe Edogawa Rampo Prize (江戸川乱歩賞 Edogawa Ranpo Shō?), named after Edogawa Rampo, is a Japanese literary award which has been presented every year by the Mystery Writers of Japan since 1955. The winner is given a prize of ¥10 million with publication rights by Kodansha.[14]\\nThese ten essays are included in The Edogawa Rampo Reader.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nKenneth Martin Edwards (born 7 July 1955) is a British crime novelist, whose work has won multiple awards including lifetime achievement awards for his fiction, non-fiction, short fiction, and scholarship in the UK and the United States. As a crime fiction  critic[1] and historian, and also in his career as a solicitor, he has written non-fiction books and many articles. He is the current President of the Detection Club  and in 2020 was awarded the Crime Writers\\' Association\\'s Diamond Dagger, the highest honour in British crime writing, in recognition of the \"sustained excellence\" of his work in the genre.[2]\\nMartin Edwards was born in Knutsford and educated in Cheshire (at Sir John Deane\\'s Grammar School, where one of his teachers was Robert Westall, who later became a successful children\\'s author) and at Balliol College, Oxford University, where he took a first-class honours degree in jurisprudence in 1977. He qualified as a solicitor in 1980 and joined the firm of Mace & Jones, where he became a partner in 1984, and head of employment law in 1990, becoming chair of the employment law practice in 2011, when the firm merged with Weightmans LLP. After spending three years with Weightmans as a partner, he is now a consultant. In 1988, he married Helena Shanks and they have two children, Jonathan and Catherine.[3] He is well-known for his expertise on crime fiction and in other fields. He has taken part in Criminal Mastermind at two Bouchercon conventions, in 1990 and 1995, and at two CrimeFest conventions, in 2009 and 2010, winning on three occasions and finishing as runner-up once.[4] In 2022, he captained the Balliol College team which became series champions in Christmas University Challenge 2022, the final series hosted by Jeremy Paxman.[5]\\n“Martin Edwards has earned distinction in every area of the crime-fiction field\", said Ellery Queen\\'s Mystery Magazine in July 2016.[6] Four years later, the Crime Writers’ Association named him as the recipient of the Diamond Dagger in recognition of the sustained excellence of his work coupled with his significant contribution to crime writing published in the English language, and Ian Rankin said ‘His novels feature an acute sense of place as well as deep psychological insights.’ [2] His latest novel is Sepulchre Street. Like Gallows Court, Mortmain Hall and Blackstone Fell, the story features Rachel Savernake and is set in the early 1930s. Lee Child described Gallows Court as ‘Superb... the book Edwards was born to write’,[7] and in 2019 the novel was longlisted for the CWA Historical Dagger and shortlisted for the eDunnit award for best hardback and ebook novel of the year.[8] Blackstone Fell was longlisted for the CWA Historical Dagger in 2023.[9]\\nHis first novel, All the Lonely People, introduced Liverpool lawyer Harry Devlin[10] and was published in 1991, earning a nomination for the John Creasey Memorial Dagger for best first crime novel of the year.[11][12] In 2012 the book was republished by Arcturus in its series of Crime Classics, while Yesterday\\'s Papers was reissued as an Arcturus Crime Classic in 2013. To date, Edwards has written eight novels about Devlin; the most recent is Waterloo Sunset. The Coffin Trail was the first of eight books set in the Lake District[13] (The Lake District Mysteries) featuring Detective Chief Inspector Hannah Scarlett and historian Daniel Kind; it was short-listed for the Theakston\\'s Old Peculier Award for best crime novel of 2006. The Arsenic Labyrinth was short-listed for the Lakeland Book of the Year Award in 2008. Edwards has also written a stand-alone novel of psychological suspense, Take My Breath Away, and completed The Lazarus Widow by the late Bill Knox.[14] 2008 also saw the publication of his first historical novel, Dancing for the Hangman, a fictional account of the life and misadventures of Hawley Harvey Crippen. Writing in Historical Noir, Barry Forshaw said it was “a book to make readers wish that the versatile Edwards might tackle the historical crime genre more often.”[15]\\nEdwards has written over 70 short stories, which have appeared in a wide range of magazines and anthologies, and he has edited the Crime Writers\\' Association\\'s annual crime anthology since 1996.[16][14] His early stories were collected in Where Do You Find Your Ideas? and other stories, which had an introduction by Reginald Hill. Edwards won the CWA Short Story Dagger in 2008 with \\'The Bookbinder\\'s Apprentice\\' and has also been shortlisted three times for the same Dagger with \\'Test Drive\\', \\'Murder and its Motives\\' and \\'Strangers in a Pub\\' in 2005, 2017, and 2019 respectively. In 2014, he was the inaugural winner of the CWA Margery Allingham Prize for his story \\'Acknowledgments.\\'[17] In 2021 he was commissioned by Mysterious Bookshop of New York City to contribute to a series of limited edition Bibliomysteries; the result was The Traitor.[18] In 2023, he became the second British writer, after Ruth Rendell, to be awarded the Edward D. Hoch Memorial Golden Derringer Award by the Short Mystery Fiction Society, in recognition of his lifetime achievement in the field of the short story.[19]\\nIn 2018, Edwards won the CWA Dagger in the Library, which recognises “a body of work by a crime writer that users of libraries particularly admire”.[20][21] He was a founder member of the Northern Chapter of the Crime Writers\\' Association and of the Murder Squad collective of crime writers. He became Vice Chair of the CWA in 2015 and became Chair of the CWA in 2017. In 2007, Edwards was appointed Archivist of the Crime Writers\\' Association, and in 2011 the CWA gave him a Red Herring Award in recognition of his services to the Association. In 2008, he was elected to membership of The Detection Club and in 2011 he was appointed its first archivist. Four years later in 2015, he became the eighth president of the club, succeeding Simon Brett. He is the only person to have held the offices of President of the Detection Club and Chair of the CWA at the same time.[22][23] He served as Chair of the CWA from January 2017 to April 2019, making him the longest-serving Chair since the CWA\\'s founder, John Creasey.[24]\\nThere has been increasing critical interest in and appreciation of Edwards\\' work, and his skill in marrying people and places with plot. In 2012, new ebook and print editions of the early Harry Devlin novels were published, including introductions by writers such as Val McDermid, Peter Lovesey, Andrew Taylor and Frances Fyfield. In her foreword to All the Lonely People, Fyfield said: \"What distinguishes this book and those that follow and what makes them classics of a kind is this marvellous quality of compassion and the celebration of all that is heroic in the corrupted ordinary.\" In The Mammoth Encyclopaedia of Modern Crime Fiction, Mike Ashley noted that the author\\'s legal knowledge \\'provides a solid reliability to the Devlin books, but their strength lies in the evocation of Liverpool both past and present\\'. Similarly, Russell James noted in Great British Fictional Detectives that the Devlin books \\'are all solid and well-informed\\'. In Scene of the Crime, Julian Earwaker and Kathleen Becker described the Devlin series as \\'a blend of classic detection and urban noir\\', pointing out that \\'The bleaker tones of the early books...are superseded by the lighter tone and more complex plotting of the later novels.\\' In Whodunit?, Rosemary Herbert said that \\'Edwards rapidly made a name for himself as a writer whose law expertise informs fiction set in a well-drawn Liverpool...Edwards\\' work as an anthologist is highly regarded.\\' In Crime Scene: Britain and Ireland, John Martin said that Edwards has \"written two superbly crafted series of crime novels...intricately plotted with subtle twists and turns.\"[25] Professor Douglas G. Greene, a leading expert on the genre writing in the magazine CADS, described Edwards as “a major detective novelist who has combined Golden Age trickiness in plotting with modern darkness in the telling.”[26]\\nIn Brit Noir, Barry Forshaw said: “He is one of the UK’s premier crime fiction anthologists, as well as being a noted expert on the Golden Age...Edwards’ own two crime fiction series...have proved to be both critically and commercially successful...such books as Yesterday’s Papers offer both the diversions of crime fiction and scene-setting of a high order... The Dungeon House, the most recent in the Lake District series at the time of writing, sports Edwards\\' usual expertise.\"[27] In Crime Fiction: a Reader’s Guide, Forshaw said that Gallows Court ‘pays homage to the legacy of vintage thrillers but introduces an urgency and sense of dark menace that are notably contemporary…Evocative period detail, twist-packed plotting and a fascinatingly enigmatic anti-heroine’.[28]\\nIn British Crime Writing: an encyclopaedia, Michael Jecks described him as \\'a writer of imagination and flair\\' and as possessing \\'a rare skill for acute description\\'.[29] In the same volume, Philip Scowcroft praised Edwards\\' books set in the Lakes \\'which he describes idiomatically and evocatively in a series of well-plotted mysteries\\'.[13] Jecks summed him up as \\'a crime writer\\'s crime writer. His plotting is as subtle as any; his writing deft and fluid; his characterisation precise, and his descriptions of the locations give the reader the impression that they could almost walk along the land blindfolded. He brings them all to life.\\'[30] Writing in The New York Times in December 2022, Sarah Weinman said: ‘Crime fiction is blessed to have Martin Edwards.[31]\\nMartin Edwards is widely recognised as a leading authority on the crime fiction genre and his history of the genre, The Life of Crime: Detecting the History of Mysteries and their Creators, has been acclaimed in Britain and the United States.[32][33][34][35] Reviewing the book in The Times, Christina Hardyment said; \\'Martin Edwards is the closest thing there has been to a philosopher of crime writing.\\'[36] The book received an Edgar award from the Mystery Writers of America and the CrimeFest H.R.F. Keating prize. In addition, it was shortlisted for CWA Gold Dagger, Agatha, and Anthony awards.[37][38][39] He is also the author of The Golden Age of Murder,[40] a widely acclaimed study of the genre between the two world wars. The book won an Edgar award from the Mystery Writers of America, an Agatha award at Malice Domestic 28, and the Macavity Award from Mystery Readers International; in the UK, it won an H.R.F. Keating award at Crimefest.[41][42][43][44][45][46] The book was also shortlisted for an Anthony award by Bouchercon 2016, and the CWA Gold Dagger for Non-Fiction.[46][47] Marcel Berlins said in The Times: ‘Few, if any books about crime fiction have provided so much information and insight so enthusiastically and, for the reader, so enjoyably. No other work mixes genre history, literary analysis and fascinating author biographies with such relish’.[48]  For The Guardian, Mark Lawson said it was ‘a book of impressive cultural omniscience...superbly compendious and entertaining’.[49]  Michael Dirda said in The Washington Post that ‘Anyone who loves classic English mysteries from the 1920s through the ’40s will revel in the highly anecdotal The Golden Age of Murder.’[50]\\nHe has reviewed crime novels for various publications and websites since 1987 and has written columns for print and online magazines such as Sherlock and Bookdagger. In 2017, he wrote a lengthy commentary, acclaimed as “superb”[51] to the detective fiction reviews of Dorothy L. Sayers, which he collected in Taking Detective Stories Seriously on behalf of the Dorothy L. Sayers Society. He has contributed essays to a wide range of reference books about the genre, including The Oxford Companion to Crime and Mystery Writing. He has written introductions to new editions of a wide range of books, including The Red Right Hand by Joel Townsley Rogers, Death in the Dark by Stacey Bishop, several books in Harper Collins’ Detective Story Club series of reissues, three anthologies published by Flame Tree Press, Folio Society reprints, and novels in the Chivers Black Dagger Series such as The Man Who Didn\\'t Fly by Margot Bennett and Cornell Woolrich\\'s The Bride Wore Black. In 2013, he became Series Consultant to the British Library\\'s highly successful[52] Crime Classics series.\\nHe has written introductions to most of the books published in the series, as well as for several of the books published in the British Library\\'s Classic Thrillers series. He has been commissioned to edit and introduce more than 20 anthologies of classic crime short stories for the series. In 2016, he was commissioned to write a new solution to Anthony Berkeley\\'s classic whodunit The Poisoned Chocolates Case and in 2017, the British Library published his The Story of Classic Crime in 100 Books, which in a starred review, Publishers Weekly described as \\'an exemplary reference book sure to lead readers to gems of mystery and detective fiction\\'.[53] The book was shortlisted for the Agatha,[54] Anthony,[55] and H. R. F. Keating[56] awards and longlisted for the CWA Gold Dagger for Non-Fiction.[57] Mystery Readers International gave the book the Macavity award  for best non-fiction book of the year.[58][46]\\nHowdunit, published in 2020, was a book he conceived and edited on behalf of the Detection Club, to celebrate its 90th birthday. The book discusses the art and craft of crime writing and the nature of the crime writer\\'s life. Contributors range from Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers to almost every living member of the club, including John Le Carré, Ian Rankin, Val McDermid, and Alexander McCall Smith.[59] The book won the 2021 CrimeFest H.R.F. Keating award for best biography or critical book related to crime fiction; in addition, it was nominated for five other major awards: the CWA Gold Dagger for Non-Fiction, the Edgar, the Agatha, the Macavity, and the Anthony.[45]\\nIn 2017, he received the Poirot Award at Malice Domestic 29, in recognition of his contribution to the traditional mystery genre.[60] Writing in the Malice Domestic programme, Professor Douglas G. Greene surveyed his career and concluded: \"Martin Edwards’ contributions to detective fiction, and to writing about detective fiction, have indeed been outstanding\".[61]\\nIn 2023, he received the George N. Dove Award from the Popular Culture Association, in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the serious study of the crime genre; previous British winners have included P.D. James.[62]\\nEdwards has also written extensively on the subject of true crime. In addition to his study of real-life crime investigation and famous cases, Urge to Kill, he edited Truly Criminal, a CWA anthology of essays published by The Mystery Press in 2015. Edwards’ essay in the book discusses the ‘Blazing Car’ murder for which Alfred Rouse was hanged in 1931. In 2019 he contributed an essay examining the crimes of Dr Harold Shipman to The Best New True Crime Stories: Serial Killers, edited by Mitzi Szereto.[63]\\nEdwards has written many articles and been a legal columnist for a wide range of publications including The Expatriate, Social Services Insight, and The Law Society\\'s Gazette, as well as leader writer for The Solicitors\\' Journal for 18 months in the 1990s. He has published seven books on equal opportunities, employment law and other legal subjects. In addition to his work for employers, he has throughout his career acted for many employees, and also for organisations such as the Equal Opportunities Commission, acting as the advocate for victims of pregnancy discrimination in two major cases: Lavery v Plessey Telecommunications Ltd [1982] ICR 373 and Fewster v Ferry Casinos Ltd (1999) UKEAT 408. Originally, he established distinct reputations in the fields of employment law and commercial law; his first published book concerned legal aspects of business computer acquisition, and in 1985 he acted as legal adviser to the makers of the feature film Letter to Brezhnev.\\nSince 1990, he has specialised solely in employment law. He was a founder member of the Law Society\\'s Standing Committee on Employment Law and he was also a member of the Law Society\\'s Working Party on Alternative Dispute Resolution.\\nEdwards regularly receives high rankings in independent legal directories such as The Legal 500 and Chambers Directory UK. He was described in 2007, for instance, in the former as \\'one of the leading employment lawyers in the country\\', and in the latter as \\'Mr. Employment\\'. In 2011, Chambers and Partners stated that he is \"admired for his legendary technical ability\", and added in 2012 that he has been \"roundly praised\" for his \"undoubted expertise, wealth of experience, interpersonal skills and calm approach at difficult times.\" The 2013 editions of the directories rated him as \"highly recommended\" and a \"top drawer\" employment lawyer respectively. In 2014, Chambers noted that he \"is renowned for his expertise in the field and technical proficiency\" and ranked him as Liverpool\\'s only Band I specialist employment lawyer,[64] a ranking he retained in 2015, when he was again recommended by Chambers[65][66] In 2016, The Legal 500 described him as “first-class”.[66] He was again recognised as one of the leading lawyers in his field in the 2017 and 2018 directories of Chambers; the former described him as \"a fantastic employment lawyer\".\\nHe has acted for many high-profile clients, including the Football Association, Wembley Stadium, Alder Hey Hospital, Health and Safety Executive, Liverpool Football Club, Shell UK Ltd, North West Development Agency, North West Regional Assembly, Littlewoods Pools Ltd, Littlewoods PLC, the Forum of Private Business, Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, Merseyside Police Authority and National Museums Liverpool.

       " '\\nJasper Fforde (born 11 January 1961)[1] is an English novelist, whose first novel, The Eyre Affair, was published in 2001. He is known mainly for his Thursday Next novels, but has published two books in the loosely connected Nursery Crime series and the first books of two other independent series: The Last Dragonslayer and Shades of Grey. Fforde\\'s books abound in literary allusions and wordplay, tightly scripted plots and playfulness with the conventional, traditional genres. They usually contain elements of metafiction, parody, and fantasy.\\nFforde was born in London on 11 January 1961, the son of John Standish Fforde, the 24th Chief Cashier for the Bank of England.[2] He is a grandson of the Polish political activist, Joseph Retinger, and a great-grandson of the journalist E. D. Morel.[3]\\nFforde was educated at the progressive Dartington Hall School. In his first jobs, he worked as a focus puller in the film industry. He worked on a number of films, including The Trial, Quills, GoldenEye, The Mask of Zorro, and Entrapment.[4]\\nFforde published his first novel, The Eyre Affair, in 2001.\\nHis published books include a series of novels starring the literary detective Thursday Next: The Eyre Affair, Lost in a Good Book, The Well of Lost Plots, Something Rotten, First Among Sequels, One of our Thursdays Is Missing and The Woman Who Died a Lot. The Eyre Affair had received 76 publisher rejections before its eventual acceptance for publication.[5]\\nFforde won the Wodehouse prize for comic fiction in 2004 for The Well of Lost Plots.[6] Several streets in the Thames Reach housing development in Swindon have been named after characters in the series.[7]\\nThe Big Over Easy (2005), set in the same alternative universe as the Next novels, reworks his first written novel, which initially failed to find a publisher. Its original title was Who Killed Humpty Dumpty?[8] It was later entitled Nursery Crime, which now refers to the series of books. These describe the investigations of DCI Jack Spratt. The follow-up to The Big Over Easy, The Fourth Bear, was published in July 2006 and focuses on Goldilocks and the Three Bears.\\nShades of Grey, the first novel in a new series, was published December 2009 in the United States and January 2010 in the United Kingdom.\\nIn November 2010 he produced The Last Dragonslayer, the first novel in a new series. It is a young-adult (YA) fantasy novel about a teenage orphan Jennifer Strange[9] which has now been adapted for television.[10] Two further books have been published in the series, The Song of the Quarkbeast (2011) and The Eye of Zoltar (2014). The series was originally planned as a trilogy,[11] but a fourth book in the series was announced in 2014, The Great Troll War (2021).[12]\\nIn 2009, Fforde published a story in the Welsh edition of Big Issue magazine (distributed by the homeless) called \"We are all alike\" (previously \"The Man with no Face\").[13] \\nHe also published \"The Locked Room Mystery mystery\"  [sic] in The Guardian newspaper in 2007; this story remains available online.[14] The U.S. version of Well of Lost Plots features a bonus chapter (34b) called \"Heavy Weather\", a complete story in itself, featuring Thursday Next in her position as Bellman.\\nFforde has an interest in aviation and owns and flies a Rearwin Skyranger.[citation needed]\\nOriginating with the Fforde Ffestival in September 2005,[15] the Fforde Ffiesta (cf.

       " '\\nRichard Stanley Francis CBE FRSL (31 October 1920 – 14 February 2010) was a British[1] steeplechase jockey and crime writer whose novels centre on horse racing in England.\\nAfter wartime service in the RAF, Francis became a full-time jump-jockey, winning over 350 races and becoming champion jockey of the British National Hunt. He came to further prominence in 1956 as jockey to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, riding her horse Devon Loch which fell when close to winning the Grand National. Francis retired from the turf and became a journalist and novelist.\\nMany of his novels deal with crime in the horse-racing world, with some of the criminals being outwardly respectable figures. The stories are narrated by the main character, often a jockey, but sometimes a trainer, an owner, a bookie, or someone in a different profession, peripherally linked to racing. This person always faces great obstacles, often including physical injury. More than forty of these novels became international best-sellers.\\nFrancis was born in Coedcanlas, Pembrokeshire, Wales.[2] Some sources report his birthplace as the inland town of Lawrenny, but at least two of his obituaries stated his birthplace as the coastal town of Tenby.[3][4] His autobiography says that he was born at his maternal grandparents\\' farm at Coedcanlas on the estuary of the River Cleddau,[5] roughly a mile north-west of Lawrenny. His mother had likely returned to her parents\\' home to give birth, as was the custom. He was the son of a jockey and stable manager[6] and his wife. Francis grew up in Maidenhead in Berkshire, England.[7] He left school at 15 without any qualifications,[8] intending to become a jockey; by the time he was 18, in 1938, he also was training horses.[9]\\nIn October 1945, he met Mary Margaret Brenchley (17 June 1924 – 30 September 2000)[8] at a cousin\\'s wedding. In most interviews, they commented that it was love at first sight. (Francis has some of his characters fall similarly in love within moments of meeting, as in the novels Flying Finish, Knockdown, and The Edge.) Their families were not entirely happy with their engagement, but the couple married in June 1947 in London. She had graduated with a degree in English and French from London University at the age of 19, was an assistant stage manager, and later worked as a publisher\\'s reader. She also became a pilot, and her experience of flying contributed to many novels, including Flying Finish, Rat Race, and Second Wind. She contracted polio while pregnant with their first child. (Francis drew from this in his novel Forfeit, which he named as one of his favourites.) They had two sons, Merrick (born 1950)[10] and Felix[8] (born 1953).[11]\\nFor nearly 30 years, Francis lived in Blewbury in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). In the 1980s, he and his wife moved to Florida in the United States. In 1992, they moved to the Cayman Islands, where Mary died of a heart attack in 2000. In 2006, Francis had a heart bypass operation;[citation needed] in 2007 his right foot was amputated.[12] He died of natural causes on 14 February 2010 at his Caribbean home in Grand Cayman,[13] survived by both sons.[14][15][16][17]\\nDuring the Second World War, Francis volunteered, hoping to join the cavalry. Instead, he served in the Royal Air Force, initially as a member of ground crew and later piloting fighter and bomber aircraft, including the Spitfire and Hurricane fighters,[8] and the Wellington and Lancaster bombers.[18] He received an emergency commission as a pilot officer on 29 July 1944,[19] and was promoted war-substantive flying officer on 29 January 1945.[20] Much of his six-year service career was spent in Africa.[2]\\nAfter leaving the RAF in 1946, Francis became a highly successful jockey, reaching celebrity status in the world of British National Hunt racing.[6] He won over 350 races, becoming champion jockey in the 1953–54 season.[6]\\nShortly after becoming a professional, he was offered the prestige job of first jockey to Vivian Smith, Lord Bicester.[21][22]\\nFrom 1953 to 1957, Francis was jockey to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.[23] His best remembered moment as a jockey came while riding the Queen Mother\\'s horse, Devon Loch, in the 1956 Grand National, when the horse inexplicably fell when close to winning the race.[24][25] Decades later, Francis considered losing that race his greatest regret and called it \"a disaster of massive proportions\".[2]\\nFrancis suffered racing injuries, being first hospitalized from riding at the age of 12 when a pony fell on him and broke his jaw and nose.[21] He drew from this career resulting in broken bones and damaged organs for his novels, in which his characters suffer the same. In 1957, after Francis suffered another serious fall, the Queen Mother\\'s adviser, Lord Abergavenny, advised him that she wanted him to retire from racing for her.\\nIn 1983, the Grand National at Aintree Racecourse in England \"stood at the brink of extinction,\" according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. News reporter Don Clippinger wrote, \\n\"Britain\\'s Jockey Club negotiated a $14 million deal to buy the land and save the race forever. The only problem was that the Jockey Club did not have $14 million, so two prominent racing personalities—Lord Derby and novelist Dick Francis—were selected to raise the money in a worldwide campaign\".[26] Other philanthropists, including Charles C. Fenwick Jr., who rode Ben Nevis to victory in the 1980 Grand National, and Paul Mellon, an American breeder and racing enthusiast, also contributed to saving the race.\\nFrancis wrote more than 40 international best-sellers. His first book was his autobiography The Sport of Queens (1957); he was offered the aid of a ghostwriter but rejected the idea.[27] The book\\'s success led to his becoming the racing correspondent for London\\'s Sunday Express newspaper, and he continued in that job for 16 years.\\nHe set his first thriller, Dead Cert, published in 1962, in the world of horse racing, establishing a specialized niche for his work. Subsequently, he regularly produced a novel a year for the next 38 years, missing only 1998 (during which he published a short-story collection). Although all his books were set against a similar background, his male protagonists held a variety of jobs, including artist (In the Frame and To the Hilt), investigator for the Jockey Club (Slay-Ride and The Edge), pilot (Rat Race and Flying Finish), and wine merchant (Proof). All the novels are narrated by the hero, who in the course of the story learns that he is more resourceful, brave, tricky, than he had thought, and usually finds a certain salvation for himself as well as bestowing it on others. Details of other people\\'s occupations fascinated Francis, and he explores the workings of such fields as photography, accountancy, the gemstone trade, and restaurant service on transcontinental trains—but always in the interest of the plot. Dysfunctional families were a subject which he also exploited (Reflex, a baleful grandmother; Hot Money, a multi-millionaire father and serial ex-husband; Decider, the related co-owners of a racecourse).\\nFrancis rarely re-used his lead characters. Only two heroes were used more than once; injured ex-jockey turned one-handed private investigator Sid Halley (Odds Against, Whip Hand, Come to Grief, Under Orders, also in Refusal by Felix Francis after his father\\'s death) and Kit Fielding (Break In and Bolt).\\nAccording to a columnist for the Houston Chronicle, Francis \"writes believable fairy tales for adults—ones in which the actors are better than we are but are believable enough to make us wonder if indeed we could not one day manage to emulate them.\"[28]\\nFrancis described a typical year of research and writing to an interviewer in 1989:\\nIn January, he sits down to write, staring down the barrel of a deadline. \"My publisher comes over in mid-May to collect the manuscript,\" he says, \"and it\\'s got to be done.\"The book\\'s publication takes place in England in September. American publication in past years has been in February, although his next book, Straight, is set to be published in November. Once the manuscript is out of his hands, he takes the summer off, while percolating the plot of his next book. Research on the next book begins in late summer and continues through the autumn, while he\\'s gearing up for his promotional tour for the just-published book. Come January, he sits down to write again.He doesn\\'t like book tours. He is not one for revelations, major life changes, and intimacies with strange interviewers, and he says he gets tired of answering the same questions again and again.He shuns the lecture circuit. He\\'d prefer to let his novels and his sales volume speak for themselves... And though he doesn\\'t love the act of writing [and] could easily retire, he finds himself planning his new book as each summer ends.He says, \"Each one, you think to yourself, \\'This is the last one,\\' but then, by September, you\\'re starting again. If you\\'ve got money, and you\\'re just having fun, people think you\\'re a useless character.\"Or, as independently wealthy Tor Kelsey says in The Edge, explaining why he works for a minuscule salary: \"I work... because I like it, I\\'m not all that bad at what I do, really, and it\\'s useful, and I\\'m not terribly good at twiddling my thumbs.\"[29]Francis collaborated extensively in his fiction with his wife, Mary, until her death. Learning this was a surprise to some readers and reviewers.[30][31] He credited her with being a great researcher for the novels. In 1981, Don Clippinger interviewed the Francises for The Philadelphia Inquirer and wrote, \\n\"When Dick Francis sits down each January to begin writing another of his popular mystery-adventure novels, it is almost a certain bet that his wife, Mary, has developed a new avocation... For instance, in Rat Race, [the protagonist] operated an air-taxi service that specialized in carrying jockeys, trainers and owners to distant race courses. Before that book came out in 1970, Mrs. Francis obtained a pilot\\'s license and was operating an air-taxi service of her own. Francis\\' newest novel, Reflex, is built around photography, and sure enough, Mary Francis has become accomplished behind the camera and in the darkroom... And, in their condominium, they have set up the subject of his 20th novel [Twice Shy] – a computer. While he is touring the country, she is working on new computer programs.\"[32]According to journalist Mary Amoroso, \"Mary does much of the research: She went so far as to learn to fly a plane for Flying Finish. She also edits his manuscripts and serves as a sounding board for plot line and character development. Says Francis, \\'At least the research keeps her from going out shopping.\\'\"[29] Francis told interviewers Jean Swanson and Dean James,\\nMary and I worked as a team. ... I have often said that I would have been happy to have both our names on the cover. Mary\\'s family always called me Richard due to having another Dick in the family. I am Richard, Mary was Mary, and Dick Francis was the two of us together.[2]Francis\\'s manager (and co-author of his later books) was his son Felix, who left his post as teacher of A-Level Physics at Bloxham School in Oxfordshire in order to work for his father. Felix was the inspiration behind a leading character, a marksman and physics teacher, in the novel Twice Shy. The older son, Merrick, was a racehorse trainer and later ran his own horse transport business, which inspired the novel Driving Force.\\nFather and son collaborated on four novels. Since his father\\'s death, Felix has carried on to publish novels with his father\\'s name in the title, including a return for Sid Halley (Dick Francis\\'s Refusal, 2013).\\nFrancis is the only three-time recipient of the Mystery Writers of America\\'s Edgar Award for Best Novel, winning for Forfeit in 1970, Whip Hand in 1981, and Come To Grief in 1996. Britain\\'s Crime Writers Association awarded him its Gold Dagger Award for fiction in 1979 and the Cartier Diamond Dagger Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989. He was granted another Lifetime Achievement Award. Tufts University awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1991.\\nIn 1996 he was given the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award, the highest honour bestowed by the MWA. In 2000, he was granted the Malice Domestic Award for Lifetime Achievement. He was created an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1983 and promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2000.[33]  He was inducted into the prestigious Detection Club in 1966.\\nAmoroso wrote in 1989, \"And yet he has a keen sense of the evanescence of literary endeavors. \\'Whole months of work can be gone in four hours,\\' he says ruefully. \\'People say they can\\'t put my books down, and so they read them in one sitting of four hours.\\' Francis has been long accustomed to celebrity as a British sports star, but today he is a worldwide phenomenon, having been published in 22 languages. In Australia, he is recognized in restaurants, from his book-jacket picture. He and Mary will see people reading the novels on planes and trains.\"[29]\\nFrancis was elected in 1999 a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.[34]\\nHis first novel, Dead Cert, was adapted as a film under the same title in 1974. Directed by Tony Richardson, it starred Scott Antony, Judi Dench and Michael Williams.[35] It was adapted again as Favorit (a Soviet made-for-television movie) in 1976.[36]\\nFrancis\\'s protagonist Sid Halley was featured in six TV movies made for the program The Dick Francis Thriller: The Racing Game (1979–1980), starring Mike Gwilym as Halley and Mick Ford as his partner, Chico Barnes. The first of the episodes, Odds Against, used a Francis title; the others were created for the program.\\nThree TV films of 1989 were adaptations of Bloodsport, In the Frame, and Twice Shy, all starring Ian McShane as protagonist David Cleveland, a character used only once by Francis, in the novel Slay-Ride.\\nIn April 2022, Kudos were announced to have optioned the TV rights for the works of Dick and Felix Francis. The series is tentatively titled The Turf, and will draw plots and characters from across the entirety of Francis\\' works.[37]\\nHigh Stakes was adapted into a text adventure game by Mindscape for MS-DOS and Apple II.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDr. Richard Austin Freeman MRCS LSA (11 April 1862 – 28 September 1943) was a British writer of detective stories, mostly featuring the medico-legal forensic investigator Dr. Thorndyke. He invented the inverted detective story (a crime fiction in which the commission of the crime is described at the beginning, usually including the identity of the perpetrator, with the story then describing the detective\\'s attempt to solve the mystery). This invention has been described as Freeman\\'s most notable contribution to detective fiction.[1]:\\u200a30\\u200a Freeman used some of his early experiences as a colonial surgeon in his novels. Many of the Dr. Thorndyke stories involve genuine, but sometimes arcane, points of scientific knowledge, from areas such as tropical medicine, metallurgy and toxicology.\\nAustin Freeman was the youngest of the five children of tailor Richard Freeman and Ann Maria Dunn. At the age of 18 he entered the medical school of the Middlesex Hospital and qualified MRCS and LSA in 1886.[2][note 1]\\nAfter qualifying, Freeman spent a year as a house physician at the hospital. He married his childhood sweetheart Annie Elizabeth Edwards in London on 15 April 1887,[4] and the couple later had two sons. He then entered the Colonial Service in 1887 as an assistant surgeon. He served for a time in Keta, Ghana, in 1887 during which time he dealt with an epidemic of black water fever which killed forty per cent of the European population at that port.[5] He had six months of leave[note 2] from mid 1888 and returned to Accra on the Gold Coast just in time to volunteer for the post of medical officer on the planned expedition to Ashanti and Jaman.[6]\\nFreeman was the doctor, naturalist and surveyor[note 3] for the expedition to Ashanti and Jaman, two independent states in the Gold Coast. The expedition set out from Accra on 8 December 1888, with a band consisting of a band-master and six boys playing two side drums and five fifes,[7] three European officers (the Commissioner, Freeman and the Officer in Charge of the Constables), one Native officer, 100 Hausa constables, a gunners\\' party with a rocket trough, an apothecary, apothecary\\'s assistant, a hospital orderly, and 200 bearers.[8] The expedition went first to Kumasi (or Coolmassie as it appears in older accounts), the capital of the then independent kingdom of Ashanti. Their second port of call was Bondoukou, Ivory Coast, where they arrived only to find that the king had just signed a protectorate treaty with the French.\\nHowever, the expedition was a political failure as the British spokesman blurted out in front of the chiefs that the British were willing to supply a loan of £400 which the king had requested.[note 4] However the King had requested this loan with the proviso that it be kept secret from his chiefs. He therefore denied any knowledge of it and the expedition moved on to Bontúku, the capital of Jaman. Here they were left cooling their heels while the King there finalised a treaty with the French, who had been quicker off the mark. The expedition was recalled after five months.[9] Bleiler asserts, without any supporting evidence, that \"It was mostly through Freeman\\'s intelligence and tact that the expedition was not massacred\".[10][note 5] Although the mission overall was a failure, the collection of data by Freeman was a success, and his future in the colonial service seemed assured. Unfortunately, he became ill with blackwater fever and was invalided home in 1891, being discharged from the service two months before the minimum qualification period for a pension.[4]\\nThus, he returned to London in 1891, and around 1892 served as temporary Acting Surgeon in Charge of the Throat and Ear Department at Middlesex Hospital.[12] He was in general practice in London for about five years.[2] He was appointed acting Deputy Medical Officer of Holloway Prison in about 1901, and Acting Assistant Medical Officer of the Port of London in 1904.[12] A year later he suffered a complete breakdown in his health and gave up medicine for writing.[2]\\nHis first successful stories were the Romney Pringle rogue stories[13] written in collaboration with John James Pitcairn (1860–1936), medical officer at Holloway Prison. Some were published first in Australia, under the joint pen name of Ralph J. Jay, and all of them were serialised under another pseudonym, \"Clifford Ashdown\" in Cassell\\'s Magazine in 1902 and 1903.\\nIn 1905 Freeman published his first solo novel, The Golden Pool, with the background drawn from his own time in West Africa. The protagonist is a young Englishman who steals a fetish treasure. Barzun and Taylor make the point that while this is a crime, the book was not regarded as crime fiction as \"according to old notions\" stealing things from Africans \"is no crime\".[14][note 6] Bleiler wrote that \"it is a colorful, thrilling story, all the more unusual in being ethnographically accurate\" and that \"it used to be required reading for members of the British colonial services in Africa.\"[13][15]\\nFreeman\\'s first Thorndyke story, The Red Thumb Mark, was published in 1907, and shortly afterwards he pioneered the inverted detective story, in which the identity of the criminal is shown from the beginning. Some short stories with this feature were collected in The Singing Bone in 1912. During the First World War, he served as an induction physician[13] and a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps and afterwards produced a Thorndyke novel almost every year until his death in 1943.[16]\\nFreeman briefly stopped writing at the outbreak of the Second World War, but then resumed writing in an air-raid shelter he had built in his garden. Freeman was plagued by Parkinson\\'s disease in his later years.[17] This makes his achievement all the more remarkable, as in his declining years he wrote both Mr. Polton Explains, which Bleiler says \"... is in some ways his best novel\",[10] and The Jacob Street Mystery (1942) in which Roberts considers that Thorndyke \"is at his analytical best.\"[1]:\\u200a32-33\\u200a He was living at 94, Windmill Street, Gravesend, Kent when he died on 28 September 1943.[note 7] His estate was valued at £6,471\\xa05s\\xa011d.[22] Freeman was buried in the old Gravesend and Milton Cemetery at Gravesend. The Thorndyke File [note 8] started a funding drive to erect a granite marker for Freeman\\'s grave, and this was erected in September 1979, with the text: Richard Austin Freeman, 1862\\xa0– 1943, Physician and Author, Erected by the friends of \"Dr. Thorndyke\", 1979.[23][24]\\nFreeman held conservative political views.[25] In his 1921 book Social Decay and Regeneration Freeman put forth the view that mechanization had flooded Britain with poor-quality goods and created a \"homogenized, restless, unionized working class\".[25] Freeman supported the eugenics movement and argued that people with \"undesirable\" biological traits should be prevented from breeding through \"segregation, marriage restriction, and sterilization\".[26] The book also attacked the British Labour movement and criticised the British government for permitting immigrants (whom Freeman referred to as \"Sub-Man\") to settle in Britain. Social Decay and Regeneration referred to the Russian Revolution as \"the Russian catastrophe\" and argued that society needed to protected from \"degenerates of the destructive or \"Bolshevik type.\"[27] Sections of Social Decay and Regeneration were reprinted in Eugenics Review, the journal of the British Eugenics Society.[28]\\nFreeman\\'s views on Jewish people were complex stereotypes. They are clearly set out in his eugenicist book Social Decay and Regeneration (1921). Here Freeman states that of vulgarity \"the only ancient peoples who exhibited it on an appreciable scale were the Jews and especially the Phoenician.\"[29] Freeman notes that a large proportion of the \"Alien Unfit\" crowding the East End of London, \"largely natives of Eastern Europe\" are Jews. However, the criticism is of the poor rather than of Jews overall as these unfit aliens were \"far from being the elect of their respective races\".[30] Freeman regards that, through restricting marriage with non-Jews, Jews as having practised racial segregation \"for thousands of years with the greatest success and with very evident benefit to the race\".[31] Not surprisingly, some of these views spill over into his fiction.\\nGrost states that Helen Vardon\\'s Confession (1922) \"is another bad Freeman novel suffering from offensive racial stereotypes\".[32] Helen Vardon is blackmailed into marrying the fat, old, money-lender Otway, who was \"distinctly Semitic in appearance\", and is surrounded by Jews, to save her father from prison. Otway acts in bad faith, and is grasping, keeping only one servant despite his great wealth. The whole plot is a gratuitously offensive anti-Semitic stereotype.[citation needed] Grost also states that the use of racial stereotypes in The D\\'Arblay Mystery (1926) \"marks it as a low point in Freeman\\'s fiction\".[32] However, the villain is not Jewish at all, and the only question of stereotypes comes up in the questions about whether the villain\\'s (false) hooked nose is \"a curved Jewish type, or a squarer Roman nose?\" There are no anti-Semitic tropes in the book, no grasping money-lender etc. Grost describes Pontifex, Son and Thorndyke (1931), as degenerating into \"another of Freeman\\'s anti-Semitic diatribes\". In this novel the villains are largely Jewish, and come from the community of \"unfit aliens\" that Freeman lambastes in Social Decay and Regeneration.[32]\\nSuch offensive representations of Jews in fiction were typical of the time. Rubinstein and Jolles note that while the work of many of the leading detective story writers, such as Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Freeman, featured many gratuitously negative depictions of stereotyped Jewish characters, this ended with the rise of Hitler, and they then portrayed Jews and Jewish refugees in a sympathetic light.[33] Thus with Freeman, the later novels no longer present such gratuitously offensive racial stereotypes, but present Jews much more positively.\\nIn When Rogues Fall Out (1932) Mr. Toke describes the Jewish cabinetmaker Levy as \"A most excellent workman and a thoroughly honest man\", high praise from Freeman\\'s pen. The counsel for Dolby the burglar, \"a good-looking Jew named Lyon\" executes a particularly brilliant defence of his client which Thorndyke admires. In Felo de Se; or Death at the Inn (1937) the croupier is described as \"a pleasant-faced Jew, calm, impassive and courteous, though obviously very much \\'on the spot\\'\". In The Stoneware Monkey (1938), Thorndyke is using a young Jewish man as his messenger. In Mr Polton Explains (1938), Polton is assisted first by the Jewish watchmaker Abraham and then by the Jewish solicitor Cohen, who comes to Polton\\'s aid not once but twice, not only representing him without cost, but feeding him and lending him money without interest or term.\\nFreeman was a significant author of detective fiction in his day. He was most famous for his creation of Dr. Thorndyke, and many of the obituaries recording his death referred to this in the headlines. Thus the Birmingham Daily Gazette announced \"\\'Dr. Thorndyke\\' Creator Dead\",[34] the Belfast News-Letter announced \"Obituary Dr. R. A. Freeman, Creator of \\'Dr. Thorndyke\\'\",[35] and the Evening Star (Dunedin) announced \"Obituary: Creator of Dr. Thorndyke\".[36]\\nCritical comment has tended to concentrate on four aspects of Thorndyke: Freeman\\'s quality as a writer; the close attention to logic, scientific accuracy and methods in his stories; the invention of the inverted detective story, and comparisons with Sherlock Holmes. The Times considered that the second and third of these were what singled Freeman \"out from the ruck\".[2]\\nIn Bloody Murder, Julian Symons wrote that Freeman\\'s \"... talents as a writer were negligible. Reading a Freeman story is very much like chewing dry straw.\"[37] Symons then went on to criticise the way in which Thorndyke spoke. De Blacam also noted Thorndyke\\'s \"ponderous legal phraseology\".[38] However, that pedantic ponderousness is the nature of Thorndyke\\'s character. He is a barrister and used to weighing his words carefully. He never discusses his analysis until he has built the whole picture. Others do not agree with his assessment of Freeman\\'s writing skills. Raymond Chandler, in a 13 December 1949 letter to Hamish Hamilton said: \"This man Austin Freeman is a wonderful performer. He has no equal in his genre and he is also a much better writer than you might think, if you were superficially inclined, because in spite of the immense leisure of his writing he accomplishes an even suspense which is quite unexpected.\"[39]\\nBinyon also rates Freeman\\'s writing as inferior to Doyle saying \"Thorndyke might be the superior detective, Conan Doyle is undeniably the better writer.\"[40] The Birmingham Daily Post considered that \"Mr. Austin Freeman was not, perhaps, among the finer artists of the short story, and his longer stories could limp, sometimes\" but that his approach was very effective.[41]\\nHowever, de Blacam makes the point that, quite apart from the description of the investigation, each of the descriptions of the crimes in the inverted stories \"was a fine piece of descriptive writing\".[42] Grost agrees that \"Freeman\\'s descriptive writing is excellent\" [32] Adey finds that: \"Freeman\\'s writing, though lacking Doyle\\'s atmospheric touch, was clear and concise, with dry humor and a keen eye for deductive detail.\"[43] Adams agreed that Freeman had considerable powers of narrative description when he stated that \"Nothing but the author\\'s remarkable skill in character delineation and graphic narrative\" could save his stories from being regarded as technical studies for a course on forensic medicine.[44]\\nThe proof of the pudding is in the eating, and Bleiler noted in 1973 that Freeman \"... is one of the very few Edwardian detective story writers who are still read\".[10]\\nNowadays, the inverted detective story, where we first witness the crime and then watch the attempt to solve it, is commonplace. For example, this is the format of almost every episode of the television detective series Columbo starring Peter Falk. However, this approach was an innovation in November 1910 when Freeman\\'s \"Oscar Brodski\" appeared in Pearson\\'s Magazine.[45] and immediately attracted attention. The Northern Whig said that \"Oscar Brodski\" was \"one of the most powerful detective stories we have ever read\".[46] Bleiler said that this story \"has always been considered one of the landmarks in the history of the detective story\". [47]\\nIn his essay The Art of the Detective Story Freeman wrote that in the inverted story: \"The reader had seen the crime committed, knew all about the criminal, and was in possession of all the facts. It would have seemed that there was nothing left to tell, but I calculated that the reader would be so occupied with the crime that he would overlook the evidence. And so it turned out. The second part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to most readers the effect of new matter.\"[48] However, Binyon notes that Freeman is being too modest here, and that it was Freeman\\'s art that kept the reader\\'s attention in the second part.[47]\\nReviewers approved of Freeman\\'s inverted tales. The Scotsman said that Freeman had \"... proved that a tale which tells the story of the crime first, leaving us to follow the sleuth as he tracks the criminal down, may be at least as absorbing as the old yarns which left us in the dark until the end\".[49] Rodgers noted that \"Great narrative skill is needed in order to keep the reader\\'s interest\" in a story where the crime if revealed at that start and that there have been imitators \"Freeman alone stands as not only the originator, but as the most successful proponent of this form of detective fiction\".[1]:\\u200a30-32\\u200a\\nFreeman paid a great deal of attention to details, and carried out the experiments described in his books to ensure that they worked and would give the expected results. He also went to the trouble of visiting the places he wrote about so that the details in his descriptions were correct.[50] De Balcam says that \"Freeman displays a mastery of craftsmanship\" in every story, and that he always used the language of the trade concerned. Freeman is \"a man who writes of things that he has seen, handled and understood, and not of things that he has met only in print, or in a hazy, inattentive observation\". This is a critical aspect of Freeman - he tested the methods he used. The top floor of his house was a workshop and laboratory,[51] and his books sometimes included drawings or micrographs[note 9] illustrating the evidence.\\nOne instance that shows that the methods and approaches described by Freeman were practicable lies in the prosecution of an apprentice from Barrow for coining. The apprentice had followed a method described in one of the Danby Croker stories by Freeman, and had produced a number of sovereigns that he had successfully passed.[52]\\nThe Birmingham Post noted that his attention to forensic science was fuller and \"certainly more systematically than any other writer of detective stories\" and that the accuracy of his stories gained him  \"an exceptionally large proportion of readers of the more exacting and less easily satisfied type\".[41]\\nOn logic Adams stated that to read Freeman\\'s cases intelligently \"... implies a definite exercise in the use of \\'Mill\\'s Canons of Inductive Logic\\'\" and the books offered a very practical means of testing students\\' understanding of the canons.[44] Herbert notes that Thorndyke\\'s reasoning \"... is distinguished by its rigorous logic\".[53] Thorndyke, like his creator, was a medical man and also a barrister, and \"combined his legal and medical training into a personage of willful dominance, impeccable logic, and scholarly and comprehensive inductive reasoning\".[1]:\\u200a27\\u200a\\nInevitably, commentators compared Thorndyke with Holmes. Binyon says that Thorndyke stands out from the other late Victorian and early Edwardian detectives in being a rival to Sherlock Holmes, rather than just owing their existence to his success. \"Thorndyke is the most impressive and the most intellectually powerful of fictional detectives.\"[54] Poupard notes that \"In critical comparisons with Holmes, Dr. Thorndyke is deemed the more accurate thinker and ranked superior as a scientific authority, whereas Holmes is considered the superior literary creation\".[55] One immediate clue to the difference between Thorndyke and Holmes, is that Holmes calls his inductive reasoning deduction,[56] a mistake that Thorndyke would never make. Binyon notes that Holmes often makes factual errors, referring to the blue carbuncle as crystallised charcoal, when it contains no carbon, and referring to non-existent species or martial arts.[57]\\nWard compares how Holmes deals with a hat as a clue in Doyle\\'s short story The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle (1892) with how Thorndyke treats a similar clue in Freeman\\'s short story The Anthropologist at Large (1909). After examining the hat, Holmes declares that:\\nFor his part, the first observation that Thorndyke makes is that hats often change owners over their lives, so one needs to interpret the evidence with caution. This immediately explodes at least the second and third of Holmes\\'s conclusions. Thorndyke then induces that:\\nWard notes that Thorndyke\\'s conclusions are sound, less capricious, and more practical, and allow Thorndyke to track his man down, whereas Holmes has to advertise to find his.[58]\\nHerbert notes that in comparison to Holmes, \"Thorndyke has no eccentricities, and his reasoning, unlike that of his contemporary, is distinguished by its rigorous logic – considered purely as a detective, he is perhaps the most impressive of all fictional sleuths\". [53]\\nThe following list is based on:\\nThe American edition of this is R. Austin Freeman, The Dr. Thorndyke Omnibus: 38 of His Criminal Investigations as set down by R. Austin Freeman (New York: Dodd, Mead, 1932 and later reprintings).

       " '\\nRichard Samet \"Kinky\" Friedman (born November 1, 1944) is an American singer, songwriter, novelist, humorist, politician, and former columnist for Texas Monthly who styles himself in the mold of popular American satirists Will Rogers and Mark Twain.[1]\\nFriedman was one of two independent candidates in the 2006 election for the office of Governor of Texas. Receiving 12.6% of the vote, Friedman placed fourth in the six-person race.\\nRichard Samet Friedman was born in Chicago on October 31, 1944[2] to Jewish parents, Dr. S. Thomas Friedman and his wife Minnie (Samet) Friedman.[3][4][5] Both of his parents were the children of Russian Jewish immigrants.[5] When Friedman was young, his family moved to a ranch in Kerrville, Texas in the Texas Hill Country and opened a summer camp called Echo Hill.[5]\\nFriedman had an early interest in both pop music and chess, and was chosen at age seven as one of 50 local players to challenge U.S. grandmaster Samuel Reshevsky to simultaneous games in Houston.[6] Reshevsky won all 50 games, but Friedman was, by far, the youngest competitor.\\nFriedman graduated from Austin High School in Austin, Texas, in 1962. He went on and earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Texas at Austin in 1966, majoring in Psychology. He took part in the Plan II Honors program and was a member of the Tau Delta Phi fraternity. During his first year, Chinga Chavin gave Friedman the nickname \"Kinky\" because of his curly hair.[7]\\nFriedman served two years in the United States Peace Corps, teaching in Borneo, Indonesia[8] with John Gross. During his service in the Peace Corps, he met future road manager Dylan Ferrero, with whom he still works.[9][10] Friedman lives at Echo Hill Ranch, his family\\'s summer camp near Kerrville, Texas. He founded Utopia Animal Rescue Ranch, also located near Kerrville, whose mission is to care for stray, abused and aging animals; more than 1,000 dogs have been saved from animal euthanasia.\\nFriedman formed his first band, King Arthur & the Carrots, while a student at the University of Texas at Austin. The band, which poked fun at surf music, recorded only one single in 1966 (\"Schwinn 24/Beach Party Boo Boo\").\\nBy 1973, Friedman had formed his second band, Kinky Friedman and The Texas Jewboys, which many took to be a play on the name of the famous band Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys.[11] In keeping with the band\\'s satirical nature, each member had a comical name: in addition to Kinky there were Little Jewford, Big Nig, Panama Red, Wichita Culpepper, Sky Cap Adams, Rainbow Colours, and Snakebite Jacobs.[11] More conventionally named roadie Jack Slaughter and road manager Dylan Ferrero rounded out the crew and provided most of the driving of the \"tour bus\", a Cadillac with 10-year-old expired license plates and a propensity to break down (but, according to Friedman, her talent lay in her ability to stop on a dime and pick up the change).\\nFriedman\\'s father objected to the name of the band, calling it a \"negative, hostile, peculiar thing\",[12] which gave Kinky even more reason to choose the name.\\nArriving on the wave of country rock following on from Gram Parsons, The Band, and Eagles, Friedman originally found cult fame as a country and western singer. His break came in 1973 thanks to Commander Cody of Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen, who contacted Vanguard Music on his behalf. Friedman released Kinky Friedman in 1974 for ABC Records, then toured with Bob Dylan in 1975–1976.[13] His repertoire mixed social commentary (\"We Reserve the Right to Refuse Service to You\") and maudlin ballads (\"Western Union Wire\") with raucous humor (such as \"Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns into Bed\"). His \"Ride \\'Em Jewboy\" was an extended tribute to the victims of the Holocaust.\\nOne of his most famous songs is \"They Ain\\'t Makin\\' Jews Like Jesus Anymore,\" a song in which Kinky verbally and physically beats up a drunken white racist who berates blacks, Jews, Italians, Greeks, and Sigma Nus in a bar, with lyrics such as,\\nOh, they ain\\'t makin\\' Jews like Jesus anymore,\\nThey ain\\'t makin\\' carpenters that know what nails are for\\nOther Friedman tunes include \"The Ballad of Charles Whitman,\" in which Friedman lampooned Charles Whitman\\'s sniper attack from the University of Texas at Austin\\'s Main Building tower on August 1, 1966. He also covered Chinga Chavin\\'s \"Asshole from El Paso\", a parody of Merle Haggard\\'s \"Okie from Muskogee\".\\nOne of Friedman\\'s most infamous concerts was a 1973 performance in Buffalo, New York; upon performing \"Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns into Bed\" (a song that lampoons feminism), a group of what Friedman described as \"cranked-up lesbians\" entered into a fight with the band and forced the concert to end early while Friedman and the band were escorted off stage. The National Organization for Women awarded Friedman the \"Male Chauvinist Pig Award\" later that year, an award Friedman took with pride. Friedman would not return to Buffalo until 2012.[14] Another was at The Boarding House in early-March 1975 when an offended Buffy Sainte-Marie rushed on stage and snatched the war bonnet that Friedman was wearing while he and his band were performing \"Miss Nickelodeon,\" a composition that spoofs the indigenous peoples of the Americas.[15][16]\\nFriedman and his band taped an Austin City Limits show on November 11, 1975, which was never aired.[17] According to the show\\'s executive producer, Terry Lickona, this is the first and only time in the show\\'s long history that an episode went unaired. Lickona told the Austin Chronicle \"I\\'ve seen it many times – it\\'s a very popular party tape among friends. I think it was a great show, and it might be as offensive today as it was back then.\"[18]\\nIn early 1976, he joined Bob Dylan on the second leg of the Rolling Thunder Revue tour.\\nFriedman was the musical guest on the Season 2 fifth episode of Saturday Night Live which aired on October 23, 1976. He performed his own composition \"Dear Abbie\".[19][20]\\nAlthough hard to verify, given the number of Jewish-origin entertainers in country/hillbilly-tour circles (e.g. Gilbert Maxwell \"Broncho Billy\" Anderson), Friedman claims to have been the first full-blooded Jew to take the stage at the Grand Ole Opry.[21]\\nIn February 2007, Sustain Records released a compilation of the songs of Kinky Friedman sung by other artists called Why the Hell Not ...  The compilation includes contributions by Dwight Yoakam, Willie Nelson, Lyle Lovett, and Kelly Willis.[22]\\nOn July 20, 2007, Friedman hosted the Concert to Save Town Lake to honor the memory of Lady Bird Johnson and her efforts to protect and preserve the shores of Town Lake in Austin, Texas.[23]\\nOn April 27, 2011, Friedman launched his Springtime for Kinky Tour (cf. \"Springtime for Hitler\") in Kansas City, Missouri, at Knuckleheads Saloon; it included dates in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky before heading towards the East Coast.[24] This was followed by a tour of Australia with Van Dyke Parks.[25]\\nAfter his music career stalled in the 1980s, Friedman shifted his creative focus to writing detective novels. His books have similarities to his song lyrics, featuring a fictionalized version of himself solving crimes in New York City and dispensing jokes, wisdom, recipes, charm and Jameson\\'s whiskey in equal measure. They are written in a straightforward style which owes a debt to Raymond Chandler. The Kinky character views himself as a latter-day Sherlock Holmes and he is aided in his investigations by his close friend Larry Sloman aka Ratso who assumes the role of Dr. Watson.\\nTo date, he has written two novels that do not star the Kinky Friedman character: Kill Two Birds and Get Stoned and The Christmas Pig.\\nFriedman also wrote a regular column for the magazine Texas Monthly from April 2001 to March 2005 which was suspended during his run for governor of Texas.[26] In 2008, Texas Monthly brought his column back on a bimonthly basis.\\nTwo books have been published collecting some of these nonfiction writings, as well as previously unpublished ones: \\'Scuse Me While I Whip This Out and Texas Hold\\'em. He has also published a travelog (The Great Psychedelic Armadillo Picnic) and an etiquette guide.\\nFriedman\\'s early books have been republished by Friedman\\'s own Vandam Press as ebooks. During March and April 2011, Vandam released seven of Friedman\\'s early titles including: Greenwich Killing Time, A Case of Lone Star, Musical Chairs, When The Cat\\'s Away, Frequent Flyer, Roadkill and the rarely seen Curse of the Missing Puppet Head. Elvis Jesus and Coca-Cola, God Bless John Wayne, Blast From The Past, Armadillos and Old Lace and two nonfiction books, Drinker With A Writing Problem and Heroes of A Texas Childhood were released in 2011. E-book releases are announced on Friedman\\'s Twitter feed and Facebook page, \"TheRealKinkster\".\\nFriedman also announced (via Jim Bessman\\'s column at examiner.com) the upcoming release of all Vandam Press titles as unabridged audio books \"read by the author\".\\nThe recurring character \"Rambam\", a New York private investigator and friend of the Friedman character in the books, is based on the real-life investigator, Steven Rambam, who acts as a technical advisor for the real Friedman.[27] Old Peace Corps friend and long time road manager Dylan Ferrero is also a recurring character in Kinky\\'s mystery novels; his character is known for only speaking in rock and roll quotes, a trait taken from real life.\\nIn 1986, Friedman ran for Justice of the Peace in Kerrville, Texas, as a Republican but lost the election.[28]\\nIn 2004, Friedman began an ostensibly serious, though colorful, campaign to become the Governor of Texas in 2006.  One of his stated goals is the \"dewussification\" of Texas.[29] Among his campaign slogans were \"How Hard Could It Be?\", \"Why The Hell Not?\", \"My Governor is a Jewish Cowboy\", and \"He ain\\'t Kinky, he\\'s my Governor\"[30] (cf. \"He Ain\\'t Heavy, He\\'s My Brother\").\\nFriedman had hoped to follow in the footsteps of other entertainers-turned-governors, including Jimmie Davis, Jesse Ventura, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Ronald Reagan. Jesse Ventura even campaigned with Friedman for his election.[31][32] When the campaign finance reports came out after the second quarter had ended, Friedman had raised more funds than the Democratic nominee, former Congressman Chris Bell.\\nOn election day, Friedman was defeated, receiving 12.6% of the votes in the six-candidate matchup.\\nFriedman released a statement on October 15, 2013, announcing his intent to again run for Texas agriculture commissioner as a Democrat. Friedman previously ran for the post in 2010, losing in the Democratic primary.[33]\\nFriedman supports the full legalization and cultivation of hemp and marijuana, declaring that the end of the prohibition is a health, education funding, prison reduction, border security, and state\\'s rights issue.[when?]\\nOn education, he supports higher pay for teachers and working to lower Texas\\'s dropout rate.[34] He supports more investment in harnessing Texas\\'s alternative fuel resources such as wind and biodiesel.[34] Friedman is opposed to the Trans-Texas Corridor since it relies on toll road construction.[35]\\nOn capital punishment, he previously summed up his position, \"I am not anti-death penalty, but I\\'m damn sure anti-the-wrong-guy-getting-executed.\"[36] More recently, he has clarified his position: \"The system is not perfect. Until it\\'s perfect, let\\'s do away with the death penalty.\"[37]\\nOn illegal immigration, Friedman wants to increase the number of Texas National Guard troops on the border (from the current 1,500 to 10,000), impose $25,000 and $50,000 fines on companies that hire illegal immigrants, and require foreign nationals seeking employment to purchase a foreign taxpayer ID card once they have passed a criminal background check. \"Texas can no longer wait for our federal government to solve our illegal immigration problem,\" Friedman said. \"These are steps that Texas can immediately take to help stem the tide of illegal immigrants penetrating our border.\" Had he been elected, he had promised to meet regularly with Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Governor Janet Napolitano of Arizona to develop a coordinated border state plan to supplement federal efforts to curb illegal immigration.[35] Previously, Kinky put forth the \"Five Mexican Generals\" Plan, to pay Mexican officials to halt immigration on their side of the border. Although he originally stated \"When I talk about the five Mexican generals, people think I\\'m joking but I\\'m dead serious\",[38] Friedman later told the Dallas Morning News that the plan, never meant to be carried out, was a joke with an element of seriousness.[39]\\nAccording to his official website,[35] Friedman\\'s answer to the question \"How does Kinky feel about abortion?\" is \"Kinky believes in a woman\\'s right to choose.\" In person, he hedges his bets, saying \"I\\'m not pro-life, and I\\'m not pro-choice. I\\'m pro-football.\"[40] On social issues, he has supported gay marriage, answering an Associated Press reporter\\'s question on the subject on February 3, 2005, by saying, \"I support gay marriage. I believe they have a right to be as miserable as the rest of us.\"[36] (Friedman himself has never been married.)\\nAccording to Cigar Aficionado magazine, Friedman plans to roll back \"any and all smoking bans\" if elected. One of his favorite quotes comes from Mark Twain: \"If smoking is not allowed in heaven, I shall not go.\"[41] Friedman supports the decriminalization of marijuana, though he doesn\\'t advocate making its sale legal. \"I\\'m not talking about like Amsterdam,\" he noted, \"We\\'ve got to clear some of the room out of the prisons so we can put the bad guys in there, like the pedophiles and the politicians.\"[42]\\nOn August 9, 2007, the Austin American-Statesman reported that Friedman was considering another run for governor of Texas in 2010. \"I\\'m open to running\", Friedman said, adding that he wouldn\\'t make a final decision until after the 2008 elections.[43] On February 10, 2009, Friedman confirmed to the Associated Press that he was still interested in running.[44]\\nIn an August 23, 2007 interview with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and a February 10, 2009 interview with the Associated Press, Friedman stated that if he did run in 2010, he would run as a Democrat, citing that \"God probably couldn\\'t have won as an Independent\" and that he was a Democrat all his life.[44]\\nOn April 14, 2009, Friedman announced in an email to supporters that he intended to make a second gubernatorial run, this time as a Democrat.[45] Friedman then announced on December 14, 2009, that he was leaving the gubernatorial race and would instead seek the party nomination in March 2010 for Texas Agriculture Commissioner.[46] He lost the nomination to rancher Hank Gilbert in the primary held on March 2, 2010.[47] Gilbert was in turn defeated for a second time by the incumbent Republican Todd Staples of Palestine, who vacates the office in January 2015, following his defeat for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor in the March 4, 2014, primary.\\nFriedman appeared in the 2004 documentary film Barbecue: A Texas Love Story by Austin-based director Chris Elley.[48] In the film, narrated by Governor Ann Richards, Kinky exclaims that \"Jesus loved Barbecue\" and analyzes the speech patterns of Texans versus New Yorkers.  Raw footage from Friedman\\'s interview appears in the 2005 DVD release of the film. He has appeared in other movies as well including Loose Shoes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.\\nFriedman\\'s persona as a politically incorrect raconteur has been likened to that of movie critic and commentator John Irving Bloom, better known in print as Joe Bob Briggs, with whom he appeared in the B movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.[49]\\nFriedman prefers to smoke Montecristo No. 2 Cigars, the same brand once smoked by Fidel Castro. However, he also smokes Bolivars, noting that \"Simón Bolívar is the only person in history to be exiled from a country named after him.\"[41] Friedman now makes eponymous cigars under the name Kinky Friedman Cigars.[50]\\nFriedman is given brief praise in Joseph Heller\\'s 1976 novel, Good as Gold, in which a governor (meant to satirize Lyndon B. Johnson), tells the main character, Bruce Gold: \"Gold, I like you. You remind me a lot of this famous country singer from Texas I\\'m crazy about, a fellow calls himself Kinky Friedman, the Original Texas Jewboy. Kinky\\'s smarter, but I like you more.\"\\nFriedman is friends with Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and he has visited both at the White House. He wrote about his friendships with them in his November 2001 column (\"Hail to the Kinkster\")[26] for Texas Monthly.\\nThe play Becoming Kinky: The World According to Kinky Friedman, directed by Ted Swindley (Always...Patsy Cline), starring Jesse Dayton, Little Jewford, Alan Lee, and Andross Bautsch, premiered in Houston, Texas on March 28, 2011.[51][52]\\nFriedman is responsible for the quote \"you\\'ve got to find what you love and let it kill you,\" which is often falsely attributed to the poet and novelist Charles Bukowski.[53]\\nFriedman hosted the live concert music television show \"Texas Roadhouse Live\" around 2011, which would air on over-the-air network television late Saturday night (or midnight Sunday morning) in some Texas markets.[54][55][non-primary source needed]\\nOn the 2017 album entitled Out of All This Blue, Mike Scott of The Waterboys composed a song called \"Kinky\\'s History Lesson\" where the singer attempts to correct Friedman on a number of false statements he has allegedly made.[56]\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\nJacques Heath Futrelle (April 9, 1875\\xa0– April 15, 1912) was an American journalist and mystery writer. He is best known for writing short detective stories featuring Professor Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen, also known as \"The Thinking Machine\" for his use of logic. He died in the sinking of the RMS Titanic.\\nFutrelle was born in Pike County, Georgia. He worked for the Atlanta Journal, where he began their sports section, the New York Herald, the Boston Post and the Boston American, where, in 1905, his Thinking Machine character appeared in a serialized version of the short story, \"The Problem of Cell 13\".\\nFutrelle left the Boston American in 1906 to write novels. He had a harbor-view house built in Scituate, Massachusetts, which he called \"Stepping Stones\" and spent most of his time there until his death in 1912.[1] His last work, My Lady\\'s Garter, was published posthumously in 1912. His widow inscribed in the book, \"To the heroes of the Titanic, I dedicate this my husband\\'s book\", under a photo of him.[1]\\nIn 1895, he married fellow writer Lily May Peel with whom he had two children, Virginia and Jacques \"John\" Jr.[1]\\nReturning from Europe aboard the RMS Titanic, Futrelle, a first-class passenger, refused to board a lifeboat, insisting Lily do so instead, to the point of forcing her in. She remembered the last she saw of him: he was smoking a cigarette on deck with John Jacob Astor IV. He perished in the Atlantic and his body was never found.[2][3] On July 29, 1912, Futrelle\\'s mother, Linnie Futrelle, died in her Georgia home; her death was attributed to grief over her son.[4]\\nFutrelle is used as the protagonist in Max Allan Collins\\' disaster series novel The Titanic Murders (1999), about two murders aboard the Titanic.[5]\\nSee Augustus S.

       " 'Erle Stanley Gardner (July 17, 1889 – March 11, 1970) was a prolific American author. A former lawyer, he is best known for the Perry Mason series of legal detective stories, but he wrote numerous other novels and shorter pieces and also a series of nonfiction books, mostly narrations of his travels through Baja California and other regions in Mexico.\\nThe best-selling American author of the 20th century at the time of his death, Gardner also published under numerous pseudonyms, including A. A. Fair, Carl Franklin Ruth, Carleton Kendrake, Charles M. Green, Charles J. Kenny, Edward Leaming, Grant Holiday, Kyle Corning, Les Tillray, Robert Parr, Stephen Caldwell, and once as the Perry Mason character Della Street (\"The Case of the Suspect Sweethearts\"). Three stories were published as Anonymous (\"A Fair Trial\", \"Part Music and Part Tears\", and \"You Can\\'t Run Away from Yourself\" aka \"The Jazz Baby\").\\nGardner was born in Malden, Massachusetts, the son of Grace Adelma (Waugh) and Charles Walter Gardner.[2][3] Gardner graduated from Palo Alto High School in California in 1909 and enrolled at Valparaiso University School of Law in Indiana. He was suspended after approximately one month when his interest in boxing became a distraction.  He returned to California, pursued his legal education on his own, and passed the California State Bar examination in 1911.[4]\\nGardner started his legal career by working as a typist at a law firm in California for three years. Once he was admitted to the Bar, he started working as a trial lawyer by defending impoverished people, in particular Chinese and Mexican immigrants. This experience led to his founding the Court of Last Resort in the 1940s. The Court of Last Resort, dedicated to helping people who were imprisoned unfairly or couldn\\'t get a fair trial,[5] was the first of several organizations that advocate for the wrongly convicted, which among others include The Innocence Project,[6] Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law,[7] and Centurion.[8]\\nIn 1912, Gardner wed Natalie Frances Talbert. They had a daughter, Grace.[9]  He opened his first law office in Merced in 1917, but closed it after accepting a position at a sales agency.  In 1921, he returned to law as a member of the Ventura firm Sheridan, Orr, Drapeau, and Gardner,[4] where he remained until the publication of his first Perry Mason novel in 1933.[10]\\nGardner enjoyed litigation and the development of trial strategy but was otherwise bored by legal practice. In his spare time, he began writing for pulp magazines. His first story, The Police in the House, was published in June 1921 in Breezy magazine.[11] He created many series characters for the pulps, including the ingenious Lester Leith, a parody of the \"gentleman thief\" in the tradition of A. J. Raffles; and Ken Corning, crusading lawyer, crime sleuth, and archetype for his most successful creation, Perry Mason. \\nThe Perry Mason character was inspired by Earl Rogers, a trial attorney who appeared in 77 murder trials but lost only three. He was recognized for the extensive use of demonstratives, e.g., visuals, charts and diagrams, during trial before it became common practice. Rogers is famous for his defense of, and attorney-client disagreement with, Clarence Darrow, a fellow attorney who was charged with attempted jury bribery in 1912.[12]\\nWhile the Perry Mason novels seldom delved deeply into characters\\' lives, the novels were rich in plot detail which was reality-based and drawn from his own experience.[13] In his early years writing for the pulp magazine market, Gardner set himself a quota of 1,200,000 words a year.[14]:\\u200a13\\u200a Early on, he typed stories himself, using two fingers, but later dictated them to a team of secretaries.[15]\\nMuch of the first Perry Mason novel,The Case of the Velvet Claws, published in 1933, is set at the historic Pierpont Inn near Gardner\\'s old law office in Ventura, California.[10]  In 1937, Gardner moved to Temecula, California, where he lived for the rest of his life. With the success of the Mason series, more than 80 novels, Gardner gradually reduced his contributions to the pulp magazines until the medium died in the 1950s. \\nWarner Bros. produced a series of Perry Mason feature films in the 1930s, casting a succession of actors in the Mason role: Warren William in the first four, then Ricardo Cortez and Donald Woods in one film each. Warners dropped the series in 1937 but Gardner\\'s novel The Case of the Dangerous Dowager went unfilmed until 1940: the movie version, Granny Get Your Gun, retained the Perry Mason plotline but the Mason character was removed from the film entirely.\\nThe radio program Perry Mason ran from 1943 to 1955. In 1954, CBS proposed transforming Perry Mason into a TV soap opera. When Gardner opposed the idea, CBS created The Edge of Night, featuring John Larkin—who voiced Mason on the radio show—as a thinly veiled imitation of the Mason character.[16]:\\u200a199–201\\u200a\\nIn 1957, Perry Mason became a long-running CBS-TV courtroom drama series, starring Raymond Burr in the title role. Burr had auditioned for the role of the district attorney Hamilton Burger, but asked to read for the Mason role. Burr\\'s performance as Mason was so intense and persuasive that Gardner, watching the screen test in a projection room, pointed at the screen and stated, \"That\\'s Perry Mason.\"[17] Gardner made an uncredited appearance as a judge in \"The Case of the Final Fade-Out\" (1966), the last episode of the series.[18][19]:\\u200a24\\u200a\\nBeginning in 1937 with the novel The D. A. Calls It Murder, Gardner wrote a companion series reversing the format of the Mason books. The protagonist was the resolute district attorney Doug Selby, battling in court against devious attorney Alphonse Baker Carr. Prosecutor Selby is portrayed as a courageous and imaginative crime solver; his antagonist Carr is a wily shyster whose clients are invariably \"as guilty as hell.\"\\nIn 1939, under the pen name A. A. Fair, Gardner launched a series of novels about the private detective firm Cool and Lam.\\nAfter World War II Gardner also published a few short stories for the \"glossies\" (magazines) such as Collier\\'s, Sports Afield, and Look,[20] but most of his postwar magazine contributions were nonfiction articles on travel, Western history, and forensic science. Gardner\\'s readership was a broad and international one, including the English novelist Evelyn Waugh, who in 1949 called Gardner the best living American writer.[21][22] He also created characters for various radio programs, including Christopher London (1950), starring Glenn Ford, and A Life in Your Hands (1949–1952).[16]\\nGardner had a lifelong fascination with Baja California and wrote a series of nonfiction travel accounts describing his extensive explorations of the peninsula by boat, truck, airplane, and helicopter.\\nGardner devoted thousands of hours to the Court of Last Resort, in collaboration with his many friends in the forensic, legal, and investigative communities. The project sought to review and, when appropriate, reverse miscarriages of justice against criminal defendants who had been convicted because of poor legal representation, abuse, misinterpretation of forensic evidence, or careless or malicious actions of police or prosecutors. The resulting 1952 book earned Gardner his only Edgar Award, in the Best Fact Crime category,[23] and was later made into a TV series, The Court of Last Resort.\\nIn 1912, Gardner wed Natalie Frances Talbert (16 July 1885 – 26 February 1968). Their only child, Natalie Grace Gardner[9] (January 25, 1913 — 29 February 2004), was born in Ventura, California. Gardner and his wife separated in the early 1930s, but did not divorce, and in fact their marriage lasted 56 years, until Natalie\\'s death in 1968. After that, Gardner married his secretary, Agnes \"Jean\" Bethell[24] (née Walter; 19 May 1902 – 5 December 2002), the daughter of Ida Mary Elizabeth Walter (née Itrich; 24 December 1880 – 3 March 1961).\\nThrough his daughter, Gardner had two grandchildren: Valerie Joan Naso (née McKittrick; 19 August 1941 – 12 November 2007) and Alan G. McKittrick.\\nGardner\\'s widow died in 2002, aged 100, in San Diego. She was a member of Jehovah\\'s Witnesses. She was survived by her brother, Norman Walter.\\nGardner died of cancer, diagnosed in the late 1960s,[25] on March 11, 1970, at his ranch in Temecula.[9][26] At the time of his death, he was the best-selling American writer of the 20th century.[9] His death followed by five days that of William Hopper, who played private detective Paul Drake in the Perry Mason TV series.  Gardner was cremated and his ashes scattered over his beloved Baja California peninsula.[14]:\\u200a305\\u200a The ranch, known as Rancho del Paisano at the time, was sold after his death, then resold in 2001 to the Pechanga Indians, renamed Great Oak Ranch, and eventually absorbed into the Pechanga reservation.\\nThe Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds Gardner\\'s manuscripts, art collection, and personal effects. From 1972 to 2010, the Ransom Center featured a full-scale reproduction of Gardner\\'s study that displayed original furnishings, personal memorabilia, and artifacts.[27] The space and a companion exhibition were dismantled, but a panoramic view of the study is available online.[28]\\nIn 2003, a new school in the Temecula Valley Unified School District was named Erle Stanley Gardner Middle School.[29][30]\\nIn December 2016, Hard Case Crime published The Knife Slipped, a Bertha Cool–Donald Lam mystery, which had been lost for 75 years. Written in 1939 as the second entry in the Cool and Lam series, the book was rejected at the time by Gardner\\'s publisher.[31] Published for the first time in 2016 as a trade paperback and ebook, the work garnered respectful reviews.[32][33] In 2017, Hard Case Crime followed the publication of The Knife Slipped with a reissued edition of Turn On the Heat, the book Gardner wrote to replace The Knife Slipped, and published a new edition of The Count of Nine in October 2018.[34]\\nAn unspecified article that Gardner wrote for True magazine is referred to by William S. Burroughs in his 1959 novel, Naked Lunch.[35]\\nGardner\\'s name is well-known among avid crossword puzzle solvers, because his first name contains an unusual series of common letters, starting and ending with the most common letter of the English alphabet, and because few other famous people have that name.  As of January 2012, he is noted for having the highest ratio (5.31) of mentions in the New York Times crossword puzzle to mentions in the rest of the newspaper among all other people since 1993.[36]\\nIn 2001, Huell Howser Productions, in association with KCET, Los Angeles, featured Gardner\\'s Temecula Rancho del Paisano in California\\'s Gold.

       " '\\nChester Gould (/ɡuːld/; November 20, 1900 – May 11, 1985)[1][2] was an American cartoonist, best known as the creator of the Dick Tracy comic strip, which he wrote and drew from 1931 to 1977, incorporating numerous colorful and monstrous villains.\\nChester Gould was born to Gilbert R. Gould and Alice Maud (née Miller), in a log cabin outside Pawnee, Oklahoma.[3][4] All four of his grandparents were pioneer settlers of Oklahoma.[5] One grandfather was a minister, and Gould and his family were members of the United Brethren Church.[6]\\nA cousin, Henry W. Gould, is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at West Virginia University.[7]\\nGilbert Gould was an editor at the Pawnee Courier-Dispatch, which Chester would later credit for becoming a cartoonist.[8][3] When he was 8, a Supreme Court lawyer bought a drawing Gould had made when the lawyer was in town for a political event. Over the next few years he entered various contests and enrolled in a correspondence course in drawing.[3] While still a senior in high school, he was discovered by the yearbook staff at Oklahoma A&M University and was hired to make line drawings for the 1918 and 1919 editions.[8]\\nHe enrolled at A&M himself in 1919 and drew editorial cartoons for the Tulsa Democrat and sports cartoons for The Daily Oklahoman. He was an early member of Lambda Chi Alpha, the oldest fraternity on campus, becoming its 44th initiate.[9] In 1921 he transferred to Northwestern University, drawn to Chicago by the Chicago Tribune and its support for syndicated cartoon strips.[8]\\nFor the next ten years, Gould submitted many ideas for comic strips to Joseph Patterson, publisher of the Tribune, but none were accepted.[10] To support himself, he drew ads and cartoons freelance for the Chicago Daily Journal.[8] After graduation, he was hired by the Hearst-owned Chicago Evening American, and got his first comic strips into print: Fillum Fables, a spoof of silent films, and Radio Catts, featuring an anthropomorphic family of cats fascinated by the radio. The Hearst-owned King Features Syndicate syndicated both.[8]\\nGould met and married Edna Gauger in 1926, and their daughter was born the following year. In 1928, he joined the Chicago Daily News and launched his third comic strip, called The Girl Friends, while continuing to send ideas to Patterson. In June 1931, by Gould\\'s account, he was listening to a radio series based on Sherlock Holmes stories and reading a newspaper account of Chicago\\'s most powerful mobster, Al Capone; he was inspired to create a strip about a heroic detective fighting organized crime and corruption in the city. After rejecting 60 submissions from Gould, Patterson accepted his 61st.[8]\\nGould was hired as a cartoonist with the Tribune and introduced Dick Tracy in the Detroit Mirror on Sunday, October 4, 1931.[11]  He drew the comic strip for the next 46 years from his home in Woodstock, Illinois.[12]\\nIn order to keep informed of police methods, Gould took courses in forensics and investigative procedures. He was later proud of having introduced the two-way wrist radio for Tracy in 1946, and in 1947, the closed-circuit television, both of which were later invented, though in somewhat different forms.[13]\\nGould\\'s stories were rarely pre-planned, since he preferred to improvise stories as he drew them. While fans praised this approach as producing exciting stories, it sometimes created awkward plot developments that were difficult to resolve. In one notorious case, Gould had Tracy in an inescapable deathtrap with a caisson. When Gould depicted Tracy addressing Gould personally and having the cartoonist magically extract him, publisher Joseph Patterson vetoed the sequence and ordered it redrawn. The strip also drew protests from those who felt that Gould\\'s depiction of crime was too gruesome, that he poured on too much gore and carnage.[14]\\nLater in the strip\\'s Gould period, Dick Tracy was widely criticized for being too right-wing in character and as excessively supportive of the police. A handful of critics thought Gould ignored the rights of the accused and failed to support his agenda with an adequate storyline. The late 1950s also saw a newspaper readership growing less indulgent of Gould\\'s politics.[15]\\nFor instance, Gould introduced a malodorous, tobacco-spitting character, B.O. Plenty, with little significant complaint from readers in the 1940s. However, the 1960s introduction of crooked lawyer Flyface and his relatives, surrounded by swarming flies, created a negative reader reaction strong enough for papers to drop the strip in large numbers.[16] There was then a dramatic change in the strip\\'s setting, leaving behind the strip\\'s origins as an urban crime drama for science fiction plot elements and regular visits to the Moon. An increasingly fantastic procession of enemies and stories ensued. The Apollo 11 Moon landing prompted Gould to abandon this phase. Finally, Dick Tracy was beset by the overall trend in newspaper comics away from strips with continuing storylines and toward those whose stories are largely resolved within one series of panels.\\nGould, his characters, and improbable plots were satirized in Al Capp\\'s comic strip Li\\'l Abner with the Fearless Fosdick sequences (supposedly drawn by \"Lester Gooch\");[17] a notable villain was Bomb Face, a gangster whose head was a bomb.[18]\\nGould retired in 1977, with his last Dick Tracy strip appearing in print on Christmas Day, December 25. The strip continued with Gould\\'s longtime assistant artist, Rick Fletcher, producing the artwork and Max Allan Collins as writer.\\nGould died of congestive heart failure on May 11, 1985 at his home in Woodstock. He was 84 years old.[2] Gould is buried in Oakland Cemetery in Woodstock.[19]\\nChester Gould won the National Cartoonists Society\\'s Reuben Award in 1959 and 1977, and was awarded the Inkpot Award in 1978.[20] The Mystery Writers of America honored Gould and his work with a Special Edgar Award in 1980. In 1995, the strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative postage stamps and postcards.[21]\\nDick Tracy: The Art of Chester Gould was an exhibition in Port Chester, New York, at the Museum of Cartoon Art from October 4 through November 30, 1978. The exhibition was curated by Bill Crouch, Jr.\\nFrom 1991 until 2008, the art and artifacts of Gould\\'s career were displayed in the Chester Gould-Dick Tracy Museum that operated from the Woodstock, Illinois, Old Courthouse on the Square.[22] Visitors to the Museum saw original comic strips, correspondence, photographs, and much memorabilia, including Gould\\'s drawing board and chair. In 2000, the Museum received a Superior Achievement Award from the Illinois Association of Museums, and in 2001, it was given an Award of Excellence from the Illinois State Historical Society. The museum continues today as a virtual museum online.[23]\\nIn 2005, Gould was inducted into the Oklahoma Cartoonists Hall of Fame in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, by Michael Vance. The Oklahoma Cartoonists Collection, created by Vance, is located in the Toy and Action Figure Museum.[24]\\nA graduate of Northwestern University, Gould was honored with the naming of the Chester Gould Society for the School of Professional Studies donors.[25]\\nIn 1983, two years before Gould\\'s death, his only child, Jean Gould O\\'Connell, recorded extensive interviews with her father, who spoke at length about his early attempts during the 1920s to get syndicated and the birth of Dick Tracy. These interviews became a major source when she wrote his biography, Chester Gould: A Daughter\\'s Biography of the Creator of Dick Tracy, published by McFarland & Company in 2007.[26]\\nThe entire run of Dick Tracy is being reprinted in a book series by IDW Publishing. The series began in 2006.

The daughter of detective novelist C. W. Grafton, she said the strongest influence on her crime novels was author Ross Macdonald. Before her success with this series, she wrote screenplays for television movies.\\nSue Grafton was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to C. W. Grafton (1909–1982) and Vivian Harnsberger, both of whom were the children of Presbyterian missionaries.[2]\\nHer father was a municipal bond lawyer who also wrote mystery novels and her mother was a former high school chemistry teacher.[3] Her father enlisted in the Army during World War II when she was three and returned when she was five, after which her home life started falling apart. Both parents became alcoholics and Grafton said \"From the age of five onward, I was left to raise myself\".[4][5]\\nGrafton and her older sister Ann grew up in Louisville, where she went to Atherton High School.[5][6] She attended the University of Louisville (first year) and Western Kentucky State Teachers College (now Western Kentucky University) in her sophomore and junior years[7] before graduating from the University of Louisville in 1961 with a bachelor\\'s degree in English Literature and minors in humanities and fine arts.

He taught Grafton lessons on the writing and editing process and groomed her to be a writer. Inspired by her father, Grafton began writing when she was 18 and finished her first novel four years later. She continued writing and completed six more novels. Only two of these seven novels (Keziah Dane and The Lolly-Madonna War) were published.[5][10] Grafton would later destroy the manuscripts for her five early, unpublished novels.[11]\\nUnable to find success with her novels, Grafton turned to screenplays.[12] Grafton worked for the next 15 years writing screenplays for television movies, including Sex and the Single Parent; Mark, I Love You; and Nurse. Grafton sold the movie rights for The Lolly-Madonna War and co-wrote the screenplay for the feature film. The adaptation, released in 1973 as Lolly-Madonna XXX, starred Rod Steiger and Jeff Bridges. Her screenplay for Walking Through the Fire earned a Christopher Award in 1979. In collaboration with her husband, Steven Humphrey, she also adapted the Agatha Christie novels A Caribbean Mystery and Sparkling Cyanide for television and co-wrote A Killer in the Family and Love on the Run.[8][13] She is credited with the story upon which the screenplay for the made for TV movie Svengali (1983) was based.[14][15]\\nHer experience as a screenwriter taught her the basics of structuring a story, writing dialogue, and creating action sequences. Grafton then felt ready to return to writing fiction.[13] While going through a \"bitter divorce and custody battle that lasted six long years\", Grafton imagined ways to kill or maim her ex-husband. Her fantasies were so vivid that she decided to write them down.[16]\\nGrafton had been fascinated by mysteries series whose titles were related, such as John D. MacDonald\\'s Travis McGee series, each of which included a color in the title, and Harry Kemelman\\'s Rabbi Small series, each of which included a day of the week in the title. While reading Edward Gorey\\'s The Gashlycrumb Tinies, a picture book with an alphabetized list of ways for children to die, Grafton decided to write a series of novels whose titles would follow the alphabet. She immediately sat down and made a list of all of the crime-related words that she knew.[13]\\nThese became the series now known as the \"alphabet novels\", featuring sleuth and private investigator Kinsey Millhone. The series is set in Santa Teresa, a fictionalized version of Santa Barbara.[17] Grafton followed the lead of Ross Macdonald, who created the fictional version of the city.[18] Grafton described Kinsey Millhone as her alter ego, \"the person I might have been had I not married young and had children.\"[9]\\nThe series begins with \"A\" Is for Alibi, published and set in 1982. \"B\" Is for Burglar, followed, then \"C\" Is for Corpse, each novel\\'s title combining a letter with a word, except X. After the publication of \"G\" Is for Gumshoe, Grafton was able to quit her screenwriting job and focus on her writing.[16] Since the publication of \"A\" is for Alibi, a new episode was released each year or so.[19] The name of each book was a source of speculation.[20] In May 2009, Grafton told Media Bistro that she was \"just trying to figure out how to get from \"U\" is for Undertow to \"Z\" Is for Zero\"[21] and that \"just because she knows the endgame title for Z [...] doesn\\'t mean she knows what V, W, X, and Y will be\".[19] Grafton said that the series would end with \"Z\" Is for Zero, but she died before she could begin writing it. Her daughter said Grafton would never allow a ghostwriter to write in her name and \"as far as we in the family are concerned, the alphabet now ends at Y.\"[22]\\nGrafton\\'s novels have been published in 28 countries and in 26 languages.[22] She refused to sell the film and television rights, because writing screenplays \"cured\" her of the desire to work with Hollywood.[13] (TV movies in Japan, however, were adapted from \"B\" is for Burglar and \"D\" is for Deadbeat.)[11] Grafton told her children her ghost would haunt them if they sold the film rights after her death.[23] The books in the series were on The New York Times Best Seller list for an aggregate of about 400 weeks. F is for Fugitive was the first, entering at number 10 on the paperback list; by 1995 \"L\" is for Lawless entered the best seller list at number one followed by ten more in the series.[24]\\nGrafton\\'s style is characteristic of hardboiled detective fiction, according to the authors of \\'G\\' is for Grafton, who describe it as \"laconic, breezy, wise-cracking\".[25] The novels are framed as reports Kinsey writes in the course of her investigations, which are signed off in the epilogue of each novel. The first-person narrative allows the reader to see through the eyes of Kinsey, who chronicles various descriptions of \"eccentric buildings and places\", giving depth to the narrative.[26] The repeated descriptions of the Santa Barbara shoreline (chronicled as Kinsey\\'s early morning runs), are \"skillful, evocative writing of a caliber that takes Grafton well beyond being categorized as \\'merely\\' a writer of detective fiction and into the so-called mainstream of \\'serious\\' American fiction.\"[27]\\nGrafton first married in 1959, aged 18, to James L. Flood, with whom she had a son and a daughter. The two divorced by the time Grafton graduated from college in 1961. Her second marriage was with Al Schmidt in 1962 but it ended with protracted divorce and custody proceedings over their daughter.[34]\\nShe married her third husband, Steven F. Humphrey, in 1978.[10] They divided their time between Santa Barbara, California, and Louisville, Kentucky;[5] Humphrey taught at universities in both cities.[16] In 2000, the couple bought and later restored Lincliff, a 28-acre (11\\xa0ha) Louisville estate once owned by hardware baron William Richardson Belknap.[5][37]\\nGrafton died at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara on December 28, 2017, after a two-year battle with cancer of the appendix.[1][22][38][10]\\nIn 2019, an award in Grafton\\'s memory was established by G.P. Putnam\\'s Sons and is under the aegis of the Mystery Writers of America.[39]\\nGrafton\\'s introduction of a young, no-nonsense female private detective in the Alphabet Mystery series was ground-breaking at the time when A is for Alibi was first released in 1982. Until the creation of Kinsey Milhone and V.I. Warshawski, created by Sarah Paretsky, in Indemnity Only, also in 1982, private detectives in fiction were almost always male.[42]\\n',\n",

In 1986, she appeared on a special \"Teen Week\" episode of the NBC game show Scrabble. Then she appeared in numerous television commercials, and an episode of the sitcom Growing Pains in 1987. Her first high-profile starring role came in the Corey Haim/Corey Feldman vehicle License to Drive (1988), as a popular girl named Mercedes Lane, who serves as the love interest of Haim\\'s character. Her efforts won her a Young Artist Award nomination in the Best Young Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Fantasy category. Her strict parents forbade her to accept a role in the black comedy Heathers (1988), which had an expletive-rich script.[11] The same year, she had an uncredited appearance as Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger\\'s mother in flashbacks in their film, Twins.[citation needed]\\nIn 1989, Graham was featured in Gus Van Sant\\'s Drugstore Cowboy as Nadine, a young, drug-addicted accomplice of the two main characters (played by Matt Dillon and Kelly Lynch). Her performance gave her career an initial boost and earned her a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress. She rejected a steady role in a soap opera and a three-picture deal with a major studio because she thought it would be too restrictive.[15] After Drugstore Cowboy, she appeared in Lawrence Kasdan\\'s dark comedy I Love You to Death (1990), alongside William Hurt and Keanu Reeves, and the rock-and-roll coming-of-age film Shout (1991), for which she received a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Actress Starring in a Motion Picture.\\nAfter Graham co-starred with Benicio del Toro in a Calvin Klein commercial directed by David Lynch, the director cast her as Annie Blackburn in Twin Peaks, where she appeared in the final six episodes.

In 2002, she starred with Joseph Fiennes in Chen Kaige\\'s English-language debut film Killing Me Softly, which received overwhelmingly negative response from critics and a 0% at Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus being: \"Respected director Chen Kaige\\'s first English-language film is a spectacularly misguided erotic thriller, with ludicrous plot twists and cringe-worthy dialogue\".[23] In 2009, the site also rated it No.\\xa012 on the countdown of the worst films over the last ten years.\\nGraham\\'s other appearances in mainstream fare include playing a fictionalized version of the Jack the Ripper murder victim Mary Kelly in the film From Hell (2001), starring Johnny Depp; Anger Management (2003), starring Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson; the Farrelly Brothers comedy Say It Isn\\'t So (2001), opposite Sally Field; The Guru, co-starring Jimi Mistry, and Hope Springs (2003), co-starring Colin Firth.\\nFrom 2004 to 2008, Graham starred in several independent films Gray Matters, Broken, Adrift in Manhattan (all 2007), and Miss Conception (2008), most of which received generally negative reviews and went largely unnoticed at the box office.[24][21] Her 2005 film Mary holds a 63% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, her first \"Fresh\" film since Bowfinger.[25] The film premiered at the 2005 Venice Film Festival where it won the Special Jury Prize, as well as three smaller awards.

Gibson to create and write the series based on popular interest in the character who was first used as a radio narrator. However, Gibson was asked to use a pen name. The pen name was used primarily so numerous authors could write the stories without confusing readers. Another factor was how Gibson, also a nonfiction writer, wanted to use a pen name for his fiction. He adopted the pen name Maxwell Grant, taking the name from two stage magic dealers he knew: Maxwell Holden and U.F. Grant.  \\nGibson wrote the vast majority of Shadow stories, usually two short novels per month for The Shadow magazine. Four authors besides Gibson have used the Maxwell Grant pen name: Theodore Tinsley, who wrote 27 Shadow stories between 1936 and 1943; Lester Dent, who wrote one story, The Golden Vulture, in 1938; Bruce Elliott, who wrote 15 Shadow stories between 1946 and 1948; and Dennis Lynds, who wrote nine Shadow paperback novels between 1964 and 1967.\\nThe comic book series The Shadow: Year One, published by Dynamite Entertainment, features a character by the name of \"Maxwell Grant\".

       " \"William Edmund Butterworth III (November 10, 1929 – February 12, 2019),[1] better known by his pen name W. E. B. Griffin, was an American writer of military and detective fiction with 59 novels in seven series published under that name. Twenty-one of those books were co-written with his son, William E Butterworth IV. He also published under 11 other pseudonyms and three versions of his real name (W. E. Butterworth, William E. Butterworth, and William E. Butterworth III).[2]\\nGriffin grew up in New York City and Philadelphia. He joined the United States Army in 1946. His military occupation was counterintelligence and in this capacity he served in the Constabulary in Germany, thus earning the Army of Occupation Medal. One of Griffin's duties was delivering food to German general officers and their families, including the widow of would-be Hitler assassin Claus von Stauffenberg.  His exposure to German military and civilian aristocracy supplied much of the inspiration for such Griffin creations as Oberst Graf von Greiffenberg, who appears in several of the Brotherhood of War novels.\\nAfter completing his active duty military service, Griffin attended Philipps-Universität Marburg at Marburg-an-der-Lahn. His college days were cut short in 1951 when he was recalled to serve in the Korean War.[1]\\nIn Korea he first served as an official Army war correspondent with the 223rd Infantry Regiment, then as public information officer for U.S. X Corps, which included the 1st Marine Division.[3] Griffin received the Combat Infantryman Badge for service at the front lines.[4] His knowledge of combat and garrison life and his friendships with military personnel from different services would well serve his writing. Many of his books are dedicated to fallen comrades who died in Korea or later on in Vietnam or while serving with the international peacekeeping force dispatched during the Lebanese Civil War. Griffin was modest about his own service. He once told a Barnes & Noble interviewer: \\nMy own military background is wholly undistinguished. I was a sergeant. What happened was that I was incredibly lucky in getting to be around some truly distinguished senior officers, sergeants, and spooks.[5]After the end of the Korean War, Griffin continued to work for the military in a civilian capacity as Chief of the Publications Division of the U.S. Army Signal Aviation Test & Support Activity at Fort Rucker, Alabama.  After his first three novels proved successful, he left this job to pursue writing full-time.  To date, he has 160 fiction and nonfiction works to his credit. He was well known and respected in the literary world for his thrillers and crime novels.[6]\\nHis son William E. Butterworth IV (previously editor of Boys' Life, the magazine of the Boy Scouts of America) co-authored some of his books. Butterworth fils was a long-time editor who moved from assisting in editing his father's work to collaborator. As of July 2015, he has been co-author of sixteen Griffin books in five different novel series. He was the keynote speaker at the 2014 Mystery Writers Key West Fest.[7]\\nGriffin's knowledge of military jargon and administrative writing style shows when fictional orders and dispatches are incorporated in his novels.  Many of his characters must battle red tape and bureaucratic mix-ups, sometimes making humorous end-runs around the system.\\nGriffin was the co-founder of the William E. Colby Seminar on Intelligence, Military, and Diplomatic Affairs at Norwich University in Vermont, along with his friend, historian and Patton biographer Colonel Carlo D'Este.  Griffin was a member of the Colby Circle, having participated in the William E. Colby Writers Symposium at Norwich University.[8]\\nIn 1950, Griffin married Emma Macalik, a ballet dancer and the author of As the Waltz Was Ending, a memoir of her life growing up as a dancer in Vienna during World War II. They had a daughter (Patricia) and two sons (John S. II and William E. IV). The marriage ended in divorce in the 1990s.[9] Emma died from lung cancer in 2003.[10]\\nGriffin later married Maria del Pilar Menendez, whom he had met in Argentina.  She died in 2018.[11]\\nGriffin died in February 2019 from colorectal cancer at the age of 89.[11]\\nThe following is the list of books written by W.E.B. Griffin:[12]\\nWritten as W.E.B.

       " 'Samuel Dashiell Hammett (/ˌdæʃiːl ˈhæmɪt/;[2] May 27, 1894 – January 10, 1961) was an American writer of hard-boiled detective novels and short stories. He was also a screenwriter and political activist. Among the characters he created are Sam Spade (The Maltese Falcon), Nick and Nora Charles (The Thin Man), The Continental Op (Red Harvest and The Dain Curse) and the comic strip character Secret Agent X-9.\\nHammett is regarded as one of the very best mystery writers.[3] In his obituary in The New York Times, he was described as \"the dean of the... \\'hard-boiled\\' school of detective fiction.\"[4] Time included Hammett\\'s 1929 novel Red Harvest on its list of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005.[5] In 1990, the Crime Writers\\' Association picked three of his five novels for their list of The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time.[6] Five years later, four out of five of his novels made The Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time as selected by the Mystery Writers of America.[7] His novels and stories also had a significant influence on films, including the genres of private eye/detective fiction, mystery thrillers, and film noir.\\nHammett was born near Great Mills on the \"Hopewell and Aim\" farm in Saint Mary\\'s County, Maryland,[8] to Richard Thomas Hammett and his wife Anne Bond Dashiell. His mother belonged to an old Maryland family, whose name in French was De Chiel. He had an elder sister, Aronia, and a younger brother, Richard Jr.[9] Known as Sam, Hammett was baptized a Catholic[10] and grew up in Philadelphia and Baltimore.  Hammett\\'s family moved to Baltimore when he was four years old in 1898, and for the most part, it was the city where he lived until he left permanently in 1920 when was 26 years old.[11]  As a teen, Hammett attended the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, but his formal education ended during his first year of high school; he dropped out in 1908 due to his father\\'s declining health and the need for him to earn money to support the family.[12]\\nHe left school when he was 13 years old and held several jobs before working for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. He served as an operative for Pinkerton from 1915 to February 1922, with time off to serve in World War I. While working for the Pinkerton Detective Agency in Baltimore, he learned the trade and worked in the Continental Trust Building (now known as One Calvert Plaza).[13] He said that while with the Pinkertons he was sent to Butte, Montana, during the union strikes, though some researchers doubt this really happened.[14] The agency\\'s role in strike-breaking eventually left him disillusioned.[15]\\nHammett enlisted in the United States Army in 1918 and served in the Motor Ambulance Corps. He was afflicted during that time with the Spanish flu and later contracted tuberculosis. He spent most of his time in the Army as a patient at Cushman Hospital in Tacoma, Washington, where he met a nurse, Josephine Dolan, whom he married on July 7, 1921, in San Francisco.[16]\\nHammett and Dolan had two daughters, Mary Jane (born 1921) and Josephine (born 1926).[17] Shortly after the birth of their second child, health services nurses informed Dolan that, owing to Hammett\\'s tuberculosis, she and the children should not live with him full time. Dolan rented a home in San Francisco, where Hammett would visit on weekends. The marriage soon fell apart; however, he continued to financially support his wife and daughters with the income he made from his writing.[18]\\nHammett was first published in 1922 in the magazine The Smart Set.[21] Known for the authenticity and realism of his writing, he drew on his experiences as a Pinkerton operative.[22] Hammett wrote most of his detective fiction while he was living in San Francisco in the 1920s; streets and other locations in San Francisco are frequently mentioned in his stories. He said, \"I do take most of my characters from real life.\"[23] His novels were some of the first to use dialogue that sounded authentic to the era. \"I distrust a man that says when. If he\\'s got to be careful not to drink too much, it\\'s because he\\'s not to be trusted when he does.\"[24]\\nThe bulk of his early work, featuring a nameless private investigator, The Continental Op, appeared in leading crime-fiction pulp magazine Black Mask. Both Hammett and the magazine struggled in the period when Hammett became established.[25]\\nBecause of a disagreement with editor Philip C. Cody about money owed from previous stories, Hammett briefly stopped writing for Black Mask in 1926. He then took a full-time job as an advertisement copywriter for the Albert S. Samuels Co., a San Francisco jeweller. He was wooed back to writing for the Black Mask by Joseph Thompson Shaw, who became the new editor in the summer of 1926. Hammett dedicated his first novel, Red Harvest, to Shaw and his second novel, The Dain Curse, to Samuels.[26] Both these novels and his third, The Maltese Falcon, and fourth, The Glass Key,  were first serialized in Black Mask before being revised and edited for publication by Alfred A. Knopf. The Maltese Falcon, considered to be his best work, is dedicated to his wife Josephine.\\nFor much of 1929 and 1930, he was romantically involved with Nell Martin, a writer of short stories and several novels. He dedicated The Glass Key to her, and in turn she dedicated her novel Lovers Should Marry to him. In 1931, Hammett embarked on a 30-year romantic relationship with the playwright Lillian Hellman. Though he sporadically continued to work on material, he wrote his final novel in 1934, more than 25 years before his death. The Thin Man is dedicated to Hellman. Why he moved away from fiction is not certain; Hellman speculated in a posthumous collection of Hammett\\'s novels, \"I think, but I only think, I know a few of the reasons: he wanted to do new kind of work; he was sick for many of those years and getting sicker.\"[27] In the 1940s, Hellman and he lived at her home, Hardscrabble Farm, in Pleasantville, New York.[28]\\nRaymond Chandler, often considered Hammett\\'s successor, summarized his accomplishments in The Simple Art of Murder:\\nHammett was the ace performer, but there is nothing in his work that is not implicit in the early novels and short stories of Hemingway. Yet for all I know, Hemingway may have learned something from Hammett, as well as from writers like Dreiser, Ring Lardner, Carl Sandburg, Sherwood Anderson and himself....\\nHammett gave murder back to the kind of people that commit it for reasons, not just to provide a corpse; and with the means at hand, not with hand-wrought dueling pistols, curare, and tropical fish... He is said to have lacked heart, yet the story he thought most of himself [The Glass Key] is the record of a man\\'s devotion to a friend. He was spare, frugal, hard-boiled, but he did over and over again what only the best writers can ever do at all. He wrote scenes that seemed never to have been written before.The French novelist André Gide thought highly of Hammett, stating: \"I regard his Red Harvest as a remarkable achievement, the last word in atrocity, cynicism and horror. Dashiell Hammett\\'s dialogues, in which every character is trying to deceive all the others and in which the truth slowly becomes visible through a fog of deception, can be compared only with the best in Hemingway.\"[29]\\nHammett devoted much of his life to left-wing activism. He was a strong antifascist throughout the 1930s, and in 1937 joined the Communist Party.[30] On May 1, 1935, Hammett joined the League of American Writers (1935–1943), whose members included Lillian Hellman, Alexander Trachtenberg of International Publishers, Frank Folsom, Louis Untermeyer, I. F. Stone, Myra Page, Millen Brand, Clifford Odets, and Arthur Miller. (Members were largely either Communist Party members or fellow travelers.)[31] He suspended his anti-fascist activities when, as a member (and in 1941 president) of the League of American Writers, he served on its Keep America Out of War Committee in January 1940 during the period of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.[32]\\nEspecially in Red Harvest, literary scholars have seen a Marxist critique of the social system. One Hammett biographer, Richard Layman, calls such interpretations \"imaginative\", but he nonetheless objects to them, since, among other reasons, no \"masses of politically dispossessed people\" are in this novel. Herbert Ruhm found that contemporary left-wing media already viewed Hammett\\'s writing with skepticism, \"perhaps because his work suggests no solution: no mass-action... no individual salvation... no Emersonian reconciliation and transcendence\".[33] In a letter of November 25, 1937, to his daughter Mary, Hammett referred to himself and others as \"we reds\". He confirmed, \"in a democracy all men are supposed to have an equal say in their government\", but added that \"their equality need not go beyond that.\" He also found, \"under socialism there is not necessarily... any leveling of incomes.\"[34]\\nHellman wrote that Hammett was \"most certainly\" a Marxist, though a \"very critical Marxist\" who was \"often contemptuous of the Soviet Union\" and \"bitingly sharp about the American Communist Party\", to which he was nevertheless loyal.[35]:\\u200a12–13\\u200a\\nAt the beginning of 1942, he wrote the screenplay of Watch on the Rhine, based on Hellman\\'s successful play,  which received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay). But that year the Oscar went to Casablanca. In early 1942, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hammett again enlisted in the United States Army. Because he was 48 years old, had tuberculosis, and was a Communist, Hammett later stated he had \"a hell of a time\" being inducted into the Army.[36] However, biographer Diane Johnson suggests that confusion over Hammett\\'s forenames was the reason he was able to re-enlist.[37] He served as an enlisted man in the Aleutian Islands and initially worked on cryptanalysis on the island of Umnak. For fear of his radical tendencies, he was transferred to the Headquarters Company where he edited an Army newspaper entitled The Adakian.[38] In 1943, while still a member of the military, he co-authored The Battle of the Aleutians with Cpl. Robert Colodny, under the direction of an infantry intelligence officer, Major Henry W. Hall. While in the Aleutians, he developed emphysema.[36]\\nAfter the war, Hammett returned to political activism, \"but he played that role with less fervour than before\". He was elected president of the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) on June 5, 1946, at a meeting held at the Hotel Diplomat in New York City, and \"devoted the largest portion of his working time to CRC activities\".[39]\\nIn 1946, a bail fund was created by the CRC \"to be used at the discretion of three trustees to gain the release of defendants arrested for political reasons.\"[40] The trustees were Hammett, who was chairman, Robert W. Dunn, and Frederick Vanderbilt Field.[40]\\nThe CRC was designated a Communist front group by the US Attorney General.[41] Hammett endorsed Henry A. Wallace in the 1948 United States presidential election.[42]\\nThe CRC\\'s bail fund gained national attention on November 4, 1949, when bail in the amount of \"$260,000 in negotiable government bonds\" was posted \"to free eleven men appealing against their convictions under the Smith Act for criminal conspiracy to teach and advocate the overthrow of the United States government by force and violence.\" On July 2, 1951, their appeals exhausted, four of the convicted men fled rather than surrender themselves to federal agents and begin serving their sentences. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued subpoenas to the trustees of the CRC bail fund in an attempt to learn the whereabouts of the fugitives.[40]\\nHammett testified on July 9, 1951, in front of United States District Court Judge Sylvester Ryan, facing questioning by Irving Saypol, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, described by Time as \"the nation\\'s number-one legal hunter of top Communists\". During the hearing, Hammett refused to provide the information the government wanted, specifically the list of contributors to the bail fund, \"people who might be sympathetic enough to harbor the fugitives.\"[40] Instead, on every question regarding the CRC or the bail fund, Hammett declined to answer, citing the Fifth Amendment, refusing to even identify his signature or initials on CRC documents the government had subpoenaed. As soon as his testimony concluded, Hammett was found guilty of contempt of court.[40][43][44][45]\\nHammett served time in a West Virginia federal penitentiary, where, according to Lillian Hellman, he was assigned to clean toilets.[46][47] Hellman noted in her eulogy of Hammett that he submitted to prison rather than reveal the names of the contributors to the fund because \"he had come to the conclusion that a man should keep his word.\"[48]\\nBy 1952, Hammett\\'s popularity had declined as result of the hearings. He found himself impoverished due to a combination of the cancellation of radio programs The Adventures of Sam Spade and The Adventures of the Thin Man, and a lien on his income by the Internal Revenue Service for back taxes owed since 1943. Furthermore, his books were no longer in print.[49]\\nDuring the 1950s Hammett was investigated by Congress. He testified on March 26, 1953, before the House Un-American Activities Committee about his own activities, but refused to cooperate with the committee. No official action was taken, but his stand caused him to be blacklisted, along with others who were blacklisted as a result of McCarthyism.\\nHammett became an alcoholic before working in advertising,[22] and alcoholism continued to trouble him until 1948, when he quit under doctor\\'s orders. However, years of heavy drinking and smoking worsened the tuberculosis he contracted in World War I, and then, according to Hellman, \"jail had made a thin man thinner, a sick man sicker\\xa0... I knew he would now always be sick.\"[50]\\nHellman wrote that during the 1950s, Hammett became \"a hermit\", his decline evident in the clutter of his rented \"ugly little country cottage\", where \"signs of sickness were all around: now the phonograph was unplayed, the typewriter untouched, the beloved foolish gadgets unopened in their packages.\"[51] He may have meant to start a new literary life with the novel Tulip, but left it unfinished, perhaps because he was \"just too ill to care, too worn out to listen to plans or read contracts. The fact of breathing, just breathing, took up all the days and nights.\"[52] Hammett could no longer live alone, and they both knew it, so he spent the last four years of his life with Hellman. \"Not all of that time was easy, and some of it very bad\", she wrote, but, \"guessing death was not too far away, I would try for something to have afterwards.\"[53]\\nHammett died in Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on January 10, 1961, of lung cancer, diagnosed just two months before.\\nA veteran of both world wars, Hammett is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.[54]\\nMany of Hammett\\'s papers are held by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. This archive includes manuscripts and personal correspondence, along with a small group of miscellaneous notes.[55]\\nThe Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections at the University of South Carolina holds the Dashiell Hammett family papers.[56]\\nHammett\\'s relationship with Lillian Hellman was portrayed in the 1977 film Julia. Jason Robards won an Oscar for his depiction of Hammett, and Jane Fonda was nominated for her portrayal of Lillian Hellman.\\nHammett was the subject of a 1982 prime time PBS biography, The Case of Dashiell Hammett, that won a Peabody Award and a special Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America.[57]\\nFrederic Forrest portrayed Hammett semifictionally as the protagonist in the 1982 film Hammett, based on the novel of the same name by Joe Gores.\\nSam Shepard played Hammett in the 1999 Emmy-nominated biographical television film Dash and Lilly along with Judy Davis as Hellman.\\nHammett\\'s influence on popular culture has continued well after his death.  For example, in 1975, the film The Black Bird starred George Segal in the role of Sam Spade, Jr.; the film was a sequel and parody of the Maltese Falcon.[58] The 1976 comedic film Murder by Death spoofed a number of famous literary sleuths, including several of Hammett\\'s.[59]  The film\\'s characters included Sam Diamond and Dick and Dora Charleston, which were parodies of Hammett\\'s Sam Spade and Nick and Nora Charles.[60] In 2006, Rachel Cohn published the YA novel, Nick & Norah\\'s Infinite Playlist, whose main characters were named for the sleuths in Hammett\\'s Thin Man series.[61] The book was made into a film of the same name and released in 2008.[62] Later, Rachel Cohn and David Levithan authored several books whose main characters are named for Hammett and his partner.[63] In 2011, they published the YA suspenseful romance, Dash & Lily\\'s Book of Dares.[64]  That was followed by the sequels The Twelve Days of Dash and Lily in 2016 and Mind the Gap, Dash & Lily in 2020.[65] The book series was made into a Netflix television series.[66]\\nThere is an almost complete bibliography by Richard Layman.[67] This list is an updated listing of the works described in Dashiell Hammett: A Descriptive Bibliography.[68] Hammett\\'s entry in American Hard Boiled Crime Writers also contains a bibliography.[69]\\nThe Continental Op\\nSam Spade\\nNick and Nora Charles\\nExamples of Hammett\\'s advertising copy for the Albert S.

After their initial publication in pulp magazines, they were first collected in ten digest-sized paperbacks by Mercury Publications under an imprint, either Bestsellers Mystery,  A Jonathan Press Mystery or Mercury Mystery. The stories were edited by Ellery Queen (Frederic Dannay) and were abridged versions of the original publications.  Some of these digests were reprinted as hardcovers by World Publishing under the imprint Tower Books. The anthologies were also republished as Dell mapbacks. An important collection, The Big Knockover and Other Stories, edited by Lillian Hellman, helped revive Hammett\\'s literary reputation in the 1960s and fostered a new series of anthologies. However, most of these used Dannay\\'s abridged version of the stories. Steven Marcus, while editing the collection for the Library of America, was the first to return to the original magazine texts.[citation needed]\\nAlong with the novels, these later collections have been reprinted in paperback versions under many imprints: Vintage Crime, Black Lizard, Everyman\\'s library.\\n',\n",

When Hansen was ten, the family moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota; later, the family moved to Altadena, California, where a sister lived.[2]\\nHansen had begun writing at the age of nine; his first published work, a poem, appeared in The New Yorker, in 1952. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, he had several part-time jobs in bookstores and magazines. He continued writing poetry for various magazines, one of which was ONE, the first pro-gay publication in the United States. In 1965, Hansen wrote his first novel Strange Marriage, published under the pseudonym \"James Colton\". He also briefly sang as a part of a folk music group, hosted a radio show called Homosexuality Today, and helped organize the first Gay Pride Parade in Hollywood.[2]\\nIn 1970, Hansen published Fadeout, his first novel to be published under his own name. The novel also introduces his character Dave Brandstetter, an openly gay insurance investigator who still embodied the tough, no-nonsense personality of the classic hardboiled private investigator protagonist.[3] Brandstetter has been cited as a groundbreaking character in gay fiction and crime fiction. Hansen published eleven further books featuring Brandstetter, ending with A Country of Old Men in 1991. Hansen won the 1992 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Private Eye Writers of America, as well as a Lambda Literary Award for Gay Mystery from the Lambda Literary Foundation for A Country of Old Men. Hansen created a second private investigator character, Hack Bohannon, a former deputy sheriff who quits the force after fourteen years because of his disapproval of a whitewashed homicide inquiry and runs a horse farm.  He collected five novellas in his 1988 book Bohannon\\'s Book (Countryman Press, 1988; paperback reprint, Penguin, 1989 [ISBN\\xa0014012053X). A sequel, also collecting five novellas, appeared in 1993 as Bohannon\\'s Country (Penguin, 1993 ISBN\\xa00670849421). In 1993, Hansen won another Lambda Literary Award for Gay Fiction for Living Upstairs (1993).\\nIn addition to crime novels, Hansen wrote the more mainstream novel A Smile In His Lifetime (1981), a non-genre novel about a married gay man who achieves fame, divorces his wife, and heads into a string of homosexual relationships both good and bad. Another mainstream novel Job\\'s Year, was published in 1983. He also wrote two suspense novels in the early 1980s, and two gothic novels in the 1970s under the pseudonym \"Rose Brock\".[2]\\nHansen was married to artist Jane Bancroft, a lesbian, from 1943 to her death in 1994. He said their relationship was that of \"a gay man and a woman who happened to love each other.\" They were married for 51 years. Bancroft was an artist, scholar and teacher. She was born in Boston on February 4, 1917, and grew up in El Paso. She was an animal lover and rescued and sheltered strays. She died on September 9, 1994, following a stroke.[4] Following her death, Joseph Hansen wrote the poem The Dark/The Diary (In memoriam: J.B.H., 1917-1994).[5] The couple had one daughter, Barbara, who later transitioned and changed his name to Daniel James Hansen.[6][1] According to a friend quoted in an obituary, Hansen also had two long-term male lovers.\\nHansen disliked the term \"gay\" and always described himself as \"homosexual\".[2]\\nHansen died from heart failure in 2004 at his home in Laguna Beach, California.[1][2]\\n',\n",

Higashino has won major Japanese awards for his books, almost twenty of which have been turned into films and TV series.[1]\\nHigashino was born in the Ikuno-ku ward of the city of Osaka in Osaka Prefecture. The logographic letters that make up the family name were initially read as \"Tono\", but Keigo\\'s father changed the reading to \"Higashino\".\\nGrowing up in a working class area, Higashino\\'s childhood was challenging because of the lower class to which his family belonged.[2] He attended Koji Elementary School, Higashi Ikuno Junior High School, and Hannan High School. During his high school years he started reading mystery fiction.\\nHigashino studied Electrical Engineering at Osaka Prefecture University, where he became captain of the archery club. He graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering degree.\\nHigashino started writing while in high school and university, showing his manuscripts to friends.\\nIn 1981 he began working as an engineer at Nippon Denso Co. (presently DENSO), and married a high school teacher. He continued to write in the evenings and on weekends,[3] submitting unpublished mystery novels for consideration for the annual Edogawa Rampo Prize in 1983. In 1984 his submission, which drew on his wife\\'s occupation, reached the final round. In 1985, at the age of 27, he won the Rampo Prize for best unpublished mystery for Hōkago (放課後, After School), drawing on experiences of the archery club at his former university. He resigned from DENSO in 1986 to start a career in Tokyo as a full-time writer.\\nIn 1998 Higashino published Himitsu (秘密, Secret), which was converted into a feature film and won the 52nd Mystery Writers of Japan Award for feature films in 1999. Secret was later translated into English by Kerim Yasar and published as Naoko in 2004, with a limited print run.[3] Higashino was inspired to write the story by reading a book in which a young child possessed the memories of someone who died nearby. He tried writing a short story featuring the implications of what would happen in such an instance, \"but the ideas didn’t fully materialize. Finally I presented it as a novel and it got picked up.\" A 1999 Japanese film, Himitsu, was based on the book, as was a 2007 English-language French remake,The Secret, starring David Duchovny.[2]\\nIn 2006 Higashino won the 134th Naoki Prize for Yōgisha Ekkusu no Kenshin (容疑者Xの献身, The Devotion of Suspect X), an award for which he\\'d been nominated five times previously. Suspect X also won the 6th Honkaku Mystery Award and was ranked the number-one novel by Kono Mystery ga Sugoi! 2006 and 2006 Honkaku Mystery Best 10, annual mystery fiction guide books published in Japan. The English edition of Suspect X, translated by Alexander O. Smith, was nominated for the 2012 Edgar Award for Best Novel and the 2012 Barry Award for Best First Novel.[3]\\nHigashino received the Eiji Yoshikawa Literary Prize in 2014 for Inori no Maku ga Oriru Toki (祈りの幕が下りる時), When the Curtain of Prayer Descends), the 10th book[4] to feature Detective Kyoichiro Kaga. He thought that the book was the end of the Kaga series, as he had done what he wanted to do with it.[5]\\nHigashino is one of the most popular authors in Asia and, reportedly, the most popular novelist in China.[6] Translation rights for his books, like Suspect X, were sold as far afield as China, Thailand, France, Russia and Spain.[3] Both his The Devotion of Suspect X and Salvation of a Saint were published in 6 languages.[7] His popularity has drawn the attention of Asian academics, with papers and master\\'s theses on his work published in China,[8] Indonesia,[9] Malaysia,[10] and Taiwan,[11] for example, but has also stimulated United States scholars.[12]\\nHigashino was elected president of the Mystery Writers of Japan in 2009, and served until 2013. From 2002 to 2007 he served on various MWJ selection committees, and fulfilled a similar role for the Edogawa Rampo Award from 2008 to 2013. In 2014 he became a selection member for the Naoki Prize.[13][14]\\nAfter the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011, Higashino donated the royalties of 100,000 copies of the reprint of Kirin no Tsubasa (麒麟の翼, The Wings of the Kirin), the sequel to Newcomer, to relief efforts in affected areas.[15]\\nHigashino reportedly avoids publicity as he prefers people not to recognize him on the street.[3]\\nHigashino admitted in 2015 that his content and style had changed from his earlier writings, in which he treated motivation as the most important element.[5] In a 2011 interview he stated that he wants his \"readers to be continually surprised by my ideas.”[3]\\nIn addition to mystery novels, Higashino writes essays and story books for children. His style of writing the latter differs from his novels, and he does not use as many characters as in his novels.[citation needed] Higashino\\'s works often include scientific elements, such as nuclear power generation and brain transplantation. Sports references, such as archery and kendo, ski jumping, and snowboarding, also occur often. \\nSuspect X inverts the classical whodunit structure, as the reader learns early on who the murderer is. Andrew Joyce writes in The Wall Street Journal that Higashino explores how \"feelings of loyalty and the oppressive weight of human relations\" are \"catalysts for murder and dark pacts between neighbors or co-workers to dispose of bodies.\" Higashino claims that Japanese people prefer this format, in which the effects of characters\\' actions and intentions, in terms of emotions such as guilt and anguish, become clearer only towards the end of the story.[3]\\nWhile Higashino admits to liking Western writers, he feels most strongly influenced by Japanese authors such as Edogawa Rampo and Seicho Matsumoto. And \"so my work naturally has that Japanese sense of old-fashioned loyalty and concern for human feeling.” With regards his Western readers, Higashino wants them \"to read my work and come to understand how Japanese people think, love and hate. I want them to be impressed that there is a Japanese person who came up with such unusual stories.\"[3]\\nJapanese Mystery Fiction Guide Rankings\\nBy 2018 Higashino had published 66 novels, 20 short story collections, and one picture book. In all, there were 715 works in 8 languages by Higashino worldwide in 2020, excluding 20 which were about him.[7]\\nSome of his novels have been made into TV drama series and films:\\n\\n',\n",

He wrote, amongst others, the Ghost Squad, Jim Starling, Birdy Jones, Jack McGurk and Lemon Kelly series.\\nHe was born in Bradford, England in 1925. After two years service in the RAF, he became a secondary school teacher, then a writer, before moving to the United States to become editor of a literary magazine. He was one of the very few British juvenile authors of his generation to achieve success in America.\\nHe started writing while he was a teacher in a Secondary Modern school at Dewsbury, in the West Riding of Yorkshire in England, his intended audience being \"tough, modern kids similar to the ones I teach\".[1] He died in London England.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nAnthony Grove Hillerman (May 27, 1925 – October 26, 2008[3]) was an American author of detective novels and nonfiction works, best known for his mystery novels featuring Navajo Nation Police officers Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee. Several of his works have been adapted as theatrical and television movies.\\nTony Hillerman was born in Sacred Heart, Oklahoma, to August Alfred Hillerman, a farmer and shopkeeper, and his wife, Lucy Grove. He was the youngest of their three children, and the second son. His paternal grandparents were born in Germany, and his maternal grandparents were born in England. He was a first cousin once removed of actor John Hillerman.  He grew up in Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, attending elementary and high school with Potawatomi children.[3]\\nJeffrey Herlihy argues that this background made possible \"a significantly different portrayal of Native Americans in his writing\",[4] in comparison to other authors of his time. \"Most obviously important,\" Hillerman said of his childhood, \"was growing up knowing that Indians are just like everybody else. You grew up without an \\'us and them\\' attitude about other races.\"[5]\\nHillerman was a decorated combat veteran of World War II, serving from August 1943 to October 1945 as a mortarman in the 103rd Infantry Division in the European theatre. He earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, and a Purple Heart. He was wounded in 1945, and the injuries included broken legs, foot, and ankle, facial burns, and temporary blindness.[6]\\nHillerman attended the University of Oklahoma after the war, meeting Marie Unzner, a student in microbiology. The couple wed and had one biological child and five adopted children.[3] He graduated in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in journalism.[6]\\nFrom 1948 to 1962, he worked as a journalist, moving to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1952.[7] In 1966, he moved his family to Albuquerque, where he earned a master\\'s degree from the University of New Mexico. During his time as a writer for the Borger News-Herald in Borger, Texas, he became acquainted with the sheriff of Hutchinson County, the man upon whom he would pattern the main character in his Joe Leaphorn novels. He taught journalism from 1966 to 1987 at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, and also began writing novels. He lived there with his wife Marie until his death in 2008. At the time of his death, they had been married 60 years and had 10 grandchildren.[3][8]\\nA consistently bestselling author, he was ranked as New Mexico\\'s 22nd-wealthiest man in 1996. He wrote 18 books in his Navajo series. He wrote more than 30 books total, among them a memoir and books about the Southwest, its beauty, and its history. His literary honors were awarded for his Navajo books. Hillerman\\'s books have been translated into eight languages, among them Danish and Japanese.[7][8]\\nHillerman\\'s writing is noted for the cultural details he provides about his subjects: Hopi, Zuni, European settlers, federal agents, and especially the Navajo Nation Police. His works in nonfiction and in fiction reflect his appreciation of the natural wonders of the American Southwest and his appreciation of its indigenous people, particularly the Navajo. His mystery novels are set in the Four Corners area of New Mexico and Arizona, sometimes reaching into Colorado and Utah, with occasional forays to the big cities of Washington, DC, Los Angeles, and New York City. The protagonists are Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee of the Navajo Nation Police. Lt. Leaphorn was introduced in Hillerman\\'s first novel, The Blessing Way (1970). Sgt. Jim Chee was introduced in the fourth novel, People of Darkness. The two first work together in the seventh novel, Skinwalkers,[9] considered his breakout novel, with a distinct increase in sales with the two police officers working together.[7]\\nHillerman repeatedly acknowledged his debt to an earlier series of mystery novels written by  British-born Australian author Arthur W. Upfield and set among Australian Aborigines in remote desert regions of tropical and subtropical Australia. The Upfield novels were first published in 1928 and featured a half-European, half-aboriginal Australian hero, Detective-Inspector Napoleon (Bony) Bonaparte. Bony worked with deep understanding of Aboriginal traditions. The character was based on the achievements of an Aboriginal person known as Tracker Leon, whom Upfield had met during his years in the Australian bush.[7]\\nHillerman discussed his debt to Upfield in many interviews and in his introduction to the posthumous 1984 reprint of Upfield\\'s A Royal Abduction. In the introduction, he described the appeal of the descriptions in Upfield\\'s crime novels. It was descriptions both of the harsh Outback areas and of \"the people who somehow survived upon them\" that lured him. \"When my own Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police unravels a mystery because he understands the ways of his people, when he reads the signs in the sandy bottom of a reservation arroyo, he is walking in the tracks Bony made 50 years ago.\"[10]\\nHe also mentioned Eric Ambler, Graham Greene, and Raymond Chandler as authors who influenced him as he wrote the Leaphorn and Chee novels.[7]\\nIn an interview published in Le Monde, Hillerman said his Navajo name means \"He who is afraid of his horse\".[11]\\nTony Hillerman died on October 26, 2008, of pulmonary failure in Albuquerque at the age of 83,[3] and was interred at Santa Fe National Cemetery.[12]\\nHillerman\\'s novels were popular in France. Hillerman credits that popularity both to French curiosity about other cultures and to his translator, Pierre Bondil.[11][13]\\nHillerman is considered one of New Mexico\\'s foremost novelists.[14] The Tony Hillerman Library was dedicated in Albuquerque in 2008,[15] and the Tony Hillerman Middle School (part of Volcano Vista High School) opened in 2009.[16] Dance Hall of the Dead, published in 1973, earned Hillerman the Grand Prix de Littérature Policière in 1987, a French international literary honor. Hillerman was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Literature (Litt.D.) from the University of New Mexico in 1990.[17] He was awarded the Owen Wister Award in 2008 for \"Outstanding Contributions to the American West.\"[18]\\nHillerman was a decorated combat veteran of World War II; he earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart as a mortarman in the 103rd Infantry Division.\\nHe won and was nominated for numerous awards for his writing and his work with other writers. His first nomination came in 1972, with his novel The Fly on the Wall being nominated for an Edgar Award in the \"Best Mystery Novel\" category. Two years later his novel Dance Hall of the Dead, second book in the Leaphorn-Chee series, won the 1974 Edgar Award for Best Novel.[1] He was again nominated for the \"Best Mystery Novel\" Edgar Award in 1979 for Listening Woman and lastly in 1989 for A Thief of Time.[1] Hillerman\\'s non-fictional work Talking Mysteries was nominated in 1992 for the Edgar Award in the \"Best Critical or Biographical\" category.[19]\\nIn 1987, Hillerman received the Grand Prix de Littérature Policière for Dance Hall of the Dead. In 1991, Hillerman received the MWA\\'s Grand Master Award. Hillerman received the Nero Award for Coyote Waits[20] and the Navajo Tribe\\'s Special Friends of the Dineh Award.[2]\\nHillerman has also been successful at the annual Anthony Awards. His novel Skinwalkers won the 1988 Anthony Award for \"Best Novel\", and in the following year A Thief of Time was nominated for the 1989 Anthony Award in the same category.[21] His next nomination was for his Talking Mysteries non-fictional work which was nominated at the 1992 Anthony Awards.[21] His novel Sacred Clowns received a \"Best Novel\" nomination at the 1994 Anthony Awards, and the following year his short-story collection The Mysterious West won the 1995 Anthony Award in the \"Best Anthology/Short Story Collection\" category.[21] His last win came at the 2002 Anthony Awards at which he won the \"Best Non-fiction/Critical Work\" award for his memoir Seldom Disappointed.[21]\\nTwo of the Navajo Police novels won The Spur award, given by the Western Writers of America annually. Skinwalkers won the award in 1987 for Western Novel, and The Shape Shifter won in 2007 for Best Western Short Novel.[22]\\n Seldom Disappointed: A Memoir won the Agatha Award in 2001.[23]\\nHillerman\\'s novels were recognized at the Macavity Awards. A Thief of Time won the \"Best Novel\" award in 1989, and Talking Mysteries won the \"Best Critical/Biographical\" award in 1992.[24] Seldom Disappointed also received a nomination in the \"Best Biographical/Critical Mystery Work\" category in 2002.[24]\\nHe received the Parris Award in 1995 by Southwest Writer\\'s Workshop for his outstanding service to other writers.[25] In 2002, Hillerman received the Agatha Malice Domestic Award for Lifetime Achievement, given by Malice Domestic for mystery novels in the spirit of Agatha Christie.[2][26]\\nThe first three books feature Joe Leaphorn only (and only as a supporting secondary character in the first novel.) The next three books feature Jim Chee only. Leaphorn and Chee begin working together in the seventh novel, Skinwalkers.\\nIn 2013, Hillerman\\'s daughter Anne Hillerman published Spider Woman\\'s Daughter (ISBN\\xa00062270486), the first new novel since 2006 featuring Hillerman\\'s Navajo Police characters; the novel\\'s protagonist is Jim Chee\\'s wife, Officer Bernadette Manuelito. Leaphorn\\'s involvement is curtailed in the first chapter of the book. Leaphorn is the victim of an assassination attempt, spends half of the book in a coma, and later was severely limited in his ability to communicate. Chee and Bernadette Manuelito are the crime solvers from that book forward in the series, with Leaphorn never fully active in the investigations (though he regains his faculties over time and consults often). \\n',\n",

       " 'Barry Hughart (March 13, 1934 – August 1, 2019) was an American author of fantasy novels.\\nHughart was born in Peoria, Illinois on March 13, 1934. His father, John Harding Page, served as a naval officer. His mother, Veronica Hughart, was an architect.[1]\\nHughart was educated at Phillips Academy (Andover). After graduating from high school, he had undiagnosed depression, which was classified at the time as schizophrenia, and was treated in the Kings County Psychiatric Ward.[2] Following his release he attended Columbia University, where he obtained a bachelor\\'s degree in 1956.[3]\\nUpon his graduation from Columbia, Hughart joined the United States Air Force and served from 1956 to 1960[3] where he was involved in laying mines in the Korean Demilitarized Zone.[2]\\nDuring Hughart\\'s military service he began to develop his lifelong interest in China that led him to plan a series set in \"an Ancient China that never was\".[4] His connection to China continued after his military service, as he worked with TechTop, a military surplus company that was based in Asia, from 1960 to 1965.[3]\\nFrom 1965 to 1970 Hughart was the manager of the Lenox Hill Book Shop in New York City.\\nBarry Hughart\\'s writing career started with his novel Bridge of Birds, published in 1984, which won the 1985 World Fantasy Award for best novel and also won the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award in 1986, followed by The Story of the Stone in 1988 and Eight Skilled Gentlemen in 1990. He intended to write seven novels about the adventures of Li Kao and Number Ten Ox, but his writing career was cut short due to issues with his publishers. After his last published novel, Hughart reportedly stopped writing.[5] Hughart cites Alexandre Dumas, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Mark Twain as major influences in his work. Romance of the Three Kingdoms and The Arabian Nights are two major works he also states as affecting his own writing.[1]\\nThe Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox is a series of three books about Li Kao, an ancient sage and scholar with \"a slight flaw in his character\",[4] and his client, later assistant, the immensely strong peasant Number Ten Ox, who narrates the story. The series blends Chinese mythology—authentic and imagined, from several eras—with detective fiction and a gentle, ironic humour. The first book Bridge of Birds was published in 1984,[6] the title derived from \"The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl\" myth. It was followed in 1988  by The Story of the Stone and in 1990 by Eight Skilled Gentlemen. No further books followed, although Hughart had planned a series of seven novels. In the last of these, Li Kao and Number Ten Ox would die facing the Great White Serpent (a conflict alluded to in Bridge of Birds). They would then become minor celestial deities who would continue to cause problems for the August Personage of Jade.[1]  An omnibus edition, The Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox was first published in 1998 by The Stars Our Destination Books in both hardback and trade paperback. It was illustrated by Kaja Foglio.[7]\\nThe first novel in the series, Bridge of Birds, received the 1986 Mythopoeic Award for Best Fantasy Novel and tied for the 1985 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel. It has been translated into at least six different languages: Bulgarian; French; German; Hebrew; Japanese; and Spanish. Hughart considered the first draft of the book as completely \"wrong\" and set it aside for many years. His inspiration for finishing the book came about after reading The Importance of Understanding by Lin Yutang. Hughart stated that he realized his first version was about \"monsters and marvels and mayhem\" and that \"the book hadn\\'t really been about anything\". When he decided to continue working on the book he made \"love\" the central theme of the story.[8]\\nThe second book of the series. Master Li and Number Ten Ox set out on another adventure after the killing of a monk, to find out his murderer and to find a stolen manuscript from his library. The Story of the Stone takes place in the Valley of the Sorrows where they set out to find the Laughing Prince, the murder suspect.\\nThe third book of the series, Eight Skilled Gentlemen, is the final adventure of Master Li and Number Ten Ox.\\nIn an interview in 2000 Hughart blamed the end of the Master Li and Number Ten Ox series on unsympathetic and incompetent publishers. The style of his books made them difficult to classify and he felt his market was restricted by the decision to sell only to SF/fantasy outlets. As an example of publisher incompetence, Hughart notes that his publishers did not notify him of the awards given Bridge of Birds. He also points out that The Story of the Stone was published three months ahead of schedule, so that no purchasable copies were available by the time the scheduled reviews finally appeared; finally, the paperback edition of Eight Skilled Gentlemen was published simultaneously with the hardback edition resulting in few sales of the latter. When his publishers then refused to publish hardback editions of any future books, Hughart stated that he found it impossible to afford to continue writing novels, which brought the series to an end.[9] Later in 2008, Hughart wrote[2]\\nWill there be more? I doubt it, and it\\'s not because of bad sales and worse publishers. It\\'s simply that I\\'d taken it as far as I could. ... [N]o matter how well I wrote I\\'d just be repeating myself.Barry Hughart\\'s style has been considered  difficult to classify.[10] Hughart uses a \"faux-oriental style\"[11] with \"long alliterations, poetic hyperboles, and casual references to Chinese culture\"[12] and lighthearted humor.[13]\\nReviewers identify many themes in Hughart\\'s writing, from mystery, Chinese myths, humor, and thrill, to potions, magic plants, ghosts, and spells. Bridge of Birds is as much a fantasy as a mystery, a long complex journey. Hughart imagined his own China with its own unique history, and each novel in his series builds upon the others.[14][15] Hughart drew on numerous sources to create the Chinese mythology of Bridge of Birds.[11]\\nHughart also wrote dialogue for the following films:\\nA small note was posted to barryhughart.org stating \"It has been confirmed as of 1-Aug-2019 that Mr. Hughart has passed on.\"[18] Locus magazine also published a brief obituary indicating his date of death as 1 August 2019.[19]\\n',\n",

He is equally well known for the works of literary criticism and contemporary novels published under his real name and for the crime fiction published under the pseudonym of Michael Innes.\\nStewart was born in Edinburgh, the son of Elizabeth (Eliza) Jane (née Clark) and John Stewart of Nairn. His father was a lawyer and later the Director of Education for the City of Edinburgh.\\nStewart was educated at Edinburgh Academy from 1913 to 1924 and then studied English literature at Oriel College, Oxford, graduating BA in 1928. At Oxford he was presented with the Matthew Arnold Memorial Prize and was named a Bishop Frazer\\'s scholar. Using this, in 1929 he went to Vienna to study psychoanalysis. He was lecturer in English at the University of Leeds from 1930 to 1935 and then became Jury Professor of English in the University of Adelaide, South Australia.[1]\\nIn 1932 he married Margaret Hardwick (1905—1979).\\nHe returned to the United Kingdom to become Lecturer in English at the Queen\\'s University of Belfast from 1946 to 1948. In 1949 he became a Student (equivalent of Fellow in other Oxford colleges) of Christ Church, Oxford. By the time of his retirement in 1973, he was a professor of the university.[1]\\nIn 1990 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.[2]\\nHe died at Coulsdon in south London on 12 November 1994, aged 88. His estate was valued at £139 330.[3]\\nBetween 1936 and 1986, Stewart, writing under the pseudonym of Michael Innes, published nearly fifty crime novels and short story collections, which he later described as \"entertainments\".[1] These abound in literary allusions and in what critics have variously described as \"mischievous wit\", \"exuberant fancy\" and a \"tongue-in-cheek propensity\" for intriguing turns of phrase.[1][4] Julian Symons identified Innes as one of the \"farceurs\"—crime writers for whom the detective story was \"an over-civilized joke with a frivolity which makes it a literary conversation piece with detection taking place on the side\"—and described Innes\\'s writing as being \"rather in the manner of Peacock strained through or distorted by Aldous Huxley\".[5] His mysteries have also been described as combining \"the elliptical introspection ... [of] a Jamesian character\\'s speech, the intellectual precision of a Conradian description, and the amazing coincidences that mark any one of Hardy\\'s plots\".[1]\\nThe best-known of Innes\\'s detective creations is Sir John Appleby, who is introduced in Death at the President\\'s Lodging, in which he is a Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard. Appleby features in many of the later novels and short stories, in the course of which he rises to become Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Other novels feature portrait painter and Royal Academician, Charles Honeybath, an amateur but nonetheless effective sleuth. The two detectives meet in Appleby and Honeybath. Some of the later stories feature Appleby\\'s son Bobby as sleuth.\\nIn 2007, his family transferred all the Innes copyrights and other legal rights to Owatonna Media. Owatonna Media on-sold these copyrights to Coolabi Plc in 2009, but retained a master licence in radio and audio rights.[6] Literary rights are currently held by John Stewart Literary Management, and published by House of Stratus.[7]\\nStewart wrote several critical studies, including full-length studies of James Joyce, Joseph Conrad, Thomas Love Peacock and Thomas Hardy, as well as many novels and short stories.

Her rise to fame came with her series of detective novels featuring the police commander and poet, Adam Dalgliesh.[2]\\nJames was born in Oxford, the daughter of Sidney Victor James, a tax inspector, and his wife, Dorothy Mary James.[3] She was educated at the British School[4] in Ludlow and Cambridge High School for Girls.[5] Her mother was committed to a mental hospital when James was in her mid-teens.[6]\\nShe had to leave school at the age of sixteen to work to take care of her younger siblings, sister Monica, and brother Edward, because her family did not have much money and her father did not believe in higher education for girls.[citation needed] She worked in a tax office in Ely for three years and later found a job as an assistant stage manager for the Festival Theatre in Cambridge.[7] She married Ernest Connor Bantry White (called \"Connor\"), an army doctor, on 8 August 1941.[7] They had two daughters, Clare and Jane.\\nWhite returned from the Second World War mentally ill and was institutionalised. With her daughters being mostly cared for by Connor\\'s parents,[8] James studied hospital administration, and from 1949 to 1968 worked for a hospital board in London.[9] She began writing in the mid-1950s, using her maiden name (\"My genes are James genes\").[10][11]\\nHer first novel, Cover Her Face, featuring the investigator and poet Adam Dalgliesh of New Scotland Yard, was published in 1962.[12] Dalgliesh\\'s last name comes from a teacher of English at Cambridge High School and his first name is that of Miss Dalgliesh\\'s father.[13] Many of James\\'s mystery novels take place against the backdrop of UK bureaucracies, such as the criminal justice system and the National Health Service, in which she worked for decades starting in the 1940s. Two years after the publication of Cover Her Face, James\\'s husband died on 5 August 1964.[14] Prior to his death, James had not felt able to change her job:  \"He [Connor] would periodically discharge himself from hospital, sometimes at very short notice, and I never knew quite what I would have to face when I returned home from the office. It was not a propitious time to look for promotion or for a new job, which would only impose additional strain.  But now [after Connor\\'s death] I felt the strong need to look for a change of direction.\"[15] She applied for the grade of Principal in the Home Civil Service[14] and held positions as a civil servant within several sections of the Home Office, including the criminal section. She worked in government service until her retirement in 1979.\\nOn 7 February 1991, James was created a life peer as Baroness James of Holland Park, of Southwold in the County of Suffolk.[16] She sat in the House of Lords as a Conservative. She was an Anglican and a lay patron of the Prayer Book Society. Her 2001 work, Death in Holy Orders, displays her familiarity with the inner workings of church hierarchy.[17] Her later novels were often set in a community closed in some way, such as a publishing house, barristers\\' chambers, a theological college, an island or a private clinic. Talking About Detective Fiction was published in 2009. Over her writing career, James also wrote many essays and short stories for periodicals and anthologies, which have yet to be collected. She revealed in 2011 that The Private Patient was the final Dalgliesh novel.[18]\\nAs guest editor of BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme in December 2009, James conducted an interview with the Director General of the BBC, Mark Thompson, in which she seemed critical of some of his decisions. Regular Today presenter Evan Davis commented that \"She shouldn\\'t be guest editing; she should be permanently presenting the programme.\"[19] In 2008, she was inducted into the International Crime Writing Hall of Fame at the inaugural ITV3 Crime Thriller Awards.[20]\\nIn August 2014, James was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September\\'s referendum on that issue.[21]\\nJames\\' main home was her house at 58 Holland Park Avenue, in the area from which she took her title; she also owned homes in Oxford and Southwold.\\nJames died at her home in Oxford on 27 November 2014, aged 94.[22] She is survived by her two daughters, Clare and Jane, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.[23]\\nDuring the 1980s, many of James\\'s mystery novels were adapted for television by Anglia Television for the ITV network in the UK. These productions have been broadcast in other countries, including the US on the PBS network. Roy Marsden played Adam Dalgliesh. According to James in conversation with Bill Link on 3\\xa0May 2001 at the Writer\\'s Guild Theatre, Los Angeles, Marsden \"is not my idea of Dalgliesh, but I would be very surprised if he were.\"[24] The BBC adapted Death in Holy Orders in 2003, and The Murder Room in 2004, both as one-off dramas starring Martin Shaw as Dalgliesh. In Dalgliesh (2021), Bertie Carvel starred as the titular, enigmatic detective–poet. Six episodes, shown as three two-parters, premiered on Acorn TV on 1 November 2021 in the United States followed by a Channel 5 premiere on 4 November in the United Kingdom. A further six episodes started to air on Channel 5 in April 2023.\\nHer novel The Children of Men (1992) was the basis for the feature film Children of Men (2006), directed by Alfonso Cuarón and starring Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine.[25] Despite substantial changes from the book, James was reportedly pleased with the adaptation and proud to be associated with the film.[26]\\nA three-episode adaptation of her novel Death Comes to Pemberley, written by Juliette Towhidi, was made into the TV series Death Comes to Pemberley by Origin Pictures for BBC One. It was first shown in the UK over three nights from 26 December 2013 as part of the BBC\\'s Christmas schedule and stars Anna Maxwell Martin as Elizabeth, Matthew Rhys as Mr Darcy, Jenna Coleman as Lydia and Matthew Goode as Wickham.\\nAdam Dalgliesh mysteries\\nCordelia Gray mysteries\\nMiscellaneous novels\\n\\n\\nHonorary doctorates\\nHonorary fellowships\\n',\n",

In a 1997 essay, she says she cannot pinpoint the metamorphosis from dentist to writer of detective fiction, but several factors that steered her toward mystery writing were: \"a desire for justice, a suspicious nature, an overactive imagination, and of course, a penchant for the bizarre.\"[3]\\nKellerman is a practicing Orthodox Jew, as are her husband and son, novelists Jonathan Kellerman and Jesse Kellerman, respectively.

Miramax Films spokesman Andrew Stengel derided the claim, filed in the US District Court six days before the 1999 Academy Awards, as \"absurd\", and argued that the timing \"suggests a publicity stunt\".[4][5] An out-of-court settlement was reached.\\n(Source: Bookreporter.com – Author Bibliography  – Faye Kellerman Bibliography)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nJonathan Seth Kellerman (born August 9, 1949) is an American novelist, psychologist, and Edgar- and Anthony Award–winning author best known for his popular mystery novels featuring the character Alex Delaware, a child psychologist who consults for the Los Angeles Police Department.[1]\\nBorn on the Lower East Side of New York City, his family relocated to Los Angeles when Jonathan was nine years old.[2]\\nKellerman graduated from the University of Southern California (USC)  with a doctor of philosophy degree in psychology in 1974, and began working as a staff psychologist at the USC School of Medicine, where he eventually became a full clinical professor of pediatrics.[2] He opened a private practice in the early 1980s while writing novels in his garage at night.[3]\\nHis first published novel, When the Bough Breaks, appeared in 1985, many years after writing and having works rejected. He then wrote five best-selling novels while still a practicing psychologist. In 1990, he quit his private practice to write full-time. He has written more than 40 crime novels, as well as nonfiction works and children’s books.[3]\\nKellerman was born in New York City, son of David, an aerospace engineer and inventor, and Sylvia, a dancer and office manager. He attended Yeshiva of Central Queens (YCQ) before his family relocated to California. He grew up in Los Angeles and received a Bachelor of Arts in psychology at UCLA in 1971. He worked his way through college as a cartoonist, illustrator, journalist, and editor, as well as by teaching guitar. As a college senior, he co-wrote an unpublished novel that garnered a Samuel Goldwyn writing award. That prize has served as a stepping stone to film writing for other writers, but Kellerman deliberately avoided the world of screenwriting and enrolled in a PhD program in clinical psychology at USC. He received his doctoral degree in psychology from USC in 1974. His doctoral research was on attribution of blame for childhood psychopathology, and he published a scientific paper on that topic, his first, at the age of 22. He is currently a clinical professor of pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine.[4]\\nKellerman\\'s externship, internship, and postdoctoral fellowship were at the Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles/USC School of Medicine, where he became founding director of the psychosocial program, Division of Hematology-Oncology. Kellerman\\'s initial position at CHLA was conducting research into the effects of psychological isolation in germ-free \"plastic bubble\" rooms on the emotional and intellectual development of children with cancer.\\nSimultaneously, he was assigned to minimize the destructive consequences of such intense treatment by developing a multidisciplinary clinical approach. The success of that endeavor  led to the expansion of psychosocial services to all oncology patients at CHLA, and the program developed by Kellerman and his staff was the world’s first attempt to provide comprehensive, systematic, emotional support to pediatric cancer patients and their families, and served as the template for what is now considered appropriate care. Kellerman’s experiences at CHLA led him to publish his first book in 1980, a medical text that he edited, titled Psychological Aspects of Childhood Cancer. He is himself a survivor of thyroid cancer.\\nDuring Kellerman’s time at CHLA, he also conducted research and published in the areas of disease impact and adolescence, disease-related communication and its effect upon emotional adjustment,  pediatric pain management, sleep and anxiety disorders, the treatment of childhood encopresis, and the neuropsychological effects of central nervous system chemotherapy and radiation.\\nKellerman\\'s extensive work with anxiety disorders led him to publish a book for parents, Helping the Fearful Child, in 1981. Four years later, his first novel, When the Bough Breaks, was published, became a bestseller, and was adapted as a TV movie. He has published one, or occasionally two, bestselling thrillers every year since.  During his tenure as a practicing psychologist, he came into contact with the legal system as a consultant and expert witness, and some of those experiences have impacted his novels.\\nJonathan Kellerman lives in Los Angeles with his wife Faye Kellerman, herself a well-known best-selling crime writer. They have four children. Their oldest, Jesse Kellerman, is a best-selling novelist and award-winning playwright. Their youngest, Aliza Kellerman, co-wrote Prism, a young adult novel published in 2009, with her mother.\\nJonathan Kellerman has publicly spoken out against what he calls the \"misguided\" release of severely mentally ill people into the community, where they must fend for themselves instead of receiving proper care. He has stated that such people should receive counseling and psychotherapy as well as medication,[5] as opposed to today\\'s model in which they receive only medication and no other care at all.\\nFaye and Jonathan Kellerman\\'s decades of philanthropy include endowments at Children\\'s Hospital of Los Angeles Division of Hematology-Oncology, where a yearly lecture has been named after Jonathan, and USC\\'s department of psychology and Thornton School of Music.  They have also contributed  to numerous educational institutions, the Metropolitan Museum of Art\\'s musical instrument department, the Georgia Okeeffe Museum, and the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival.\\n',\n",

       " 'Natsuo Kirino (桐野 夏生, Kirino Natsuo) (born October 7, 1951, in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture) is the pen name of Mariko Hashioka,[1] a Japanese novelist and a leading figure in the recent boom of female writers of Japanese detective fiction.[2]\\nKirino is the middle child of three.[3]  She has two brothers, one who is six years older and one who is five years younger.[3]  Her father was an architect.[2]  Kirino has lived in many different cities, including her current residence, Tokyo.[3] Kirino married in 1975[2]  and had a daughter in 1981.[3]\\nShe earned a law degree in 1974 from Seikei University,[2]  and she dabbled in many fields of work before settling on being a writer.[3]  For example, not knowing what she wanted to do in life, Kirino began working at the Iwanami Hall movie theater in her early twenties.[4] She soon discovered it wasn\\'t right for her and just before her thirtieth birthday she started taking scriptwriting classes.[4] It wasn\\'t until she was in her thirties that she began to seriously think about becoming a writer,[4] and it wasn\\'t until her forties that she became popular as a writer.[5]\\nKirino began her writing career in 1984, when she started composing novels in the romantic genre.[6] However, these types of novels were not popular in Japan, so she found it difficult to make a living while writing them.[6] She also did not have a passion for writing romance novels and wanted to concentrate on works focusing on the psychological aspect of crimes.[6] She then turned her focus towards writing mystery novels in the early 1990s.[6] To date, she has written several short story collections and many novels,[7] and is now one of Japan\\'s most popular writers.[8]\\nShe is most famous for her 1997 novel, Out, which received the Mystery Writers of Japan Award, Japan\\'s top mystery award, and was a finalist (in English translation) for the 2004 Edgar Award.[2]  In addition, Kirino received the 1993 Edogawa Rampo Prize for mystery fiction for her debut novel, Kao ni Furikakaru Ame (Rain Falling on My Face), and the 1999 Naoki Prize for her novel Yawarakana hoho (Soft Cheeks).\\nSo far, four of her novels (Out, Grotesque, Real World, and The Goddess Chronicle, the last of which was written for the Canongate Myth Series) have been translated into English.[7]  A further novel, In is scheduled for publication in 2013.\\nIn spite of writing in stories in the genre, Kirino does not particularly like mysteries. For influential books from her childhood, Kirino cites Two Years\\' Vacation, The Three Musketeers, and Little Women as favorites.[1]\\nMany critics challenged and criticized Kirino for her storylines, especially for Out, by saying women should only be writing love stories.[4] In fact, one male radio host refused to talk with her because of the fact she wrote about a husband being murdered by his own wife.[5]  However, her fiction has been mirrored by reality with an increasing number of bizarre murders in Japan such as the woman who in 2007 murdered her husband, dismembered his body, and dumped the parts across Tokyo.[2]\\nKirino\\'s works, such as Out, ask the reader what they would do if something awful happened to them.[4] By writing novels that people can relate to, Kirino hopes her novels can help her readers through hard times and be comforted.[4] She has apparently been successful in reaching readers emotionally; for example Kirino was approached by a woman who thanked her for the liberation she felt after reading Out.[4]\\nHer work is reminiscent of American hardboiled detective stories, but her use of multiple narratives and perspectives provide \"no authoritative master narrative . . . that finally reassures the reader which of the many voices one is to trust\".[2]  Her prose style has been described as \"flat,\" \"functional,\" and \"occasionally illuminated by a strange lyricism.\"[9]  Unlike most hardboiled fiction, Kirino\\'s novels often feature a female protagonist such as her detective Miro Murano, who complicates the typical hardboiled role of females by becoming both detective and victim.[10]  By doing this, Kirino \"implicates [the reader] in the voyeuristic pleasure of the detective genre by making [the reader] conscious of [the] act of watching.\"[10]  Kirino said she is fascinated by human nature and what makes someone with a completely clean record suddenly turn into a criminal.\\nIn addition to comparisons with hardboiled crime fiction, Kirino\\'s work has been compared with horror fiction (the gruesome dismemberment scenes in Out, for example) and proletarian literature such as Kanikōsen.[8]\\nKirino has noted that her work can be viewed as a portrait of contemporary Japanese life, contrasting it with the work of Haruki Murakami, who she feels writes more for a global audience, calling his work \"global literature.\"[4]  Critic Sophie Harrison has argued that Kirino presents a less-sanitized version of Japan, far from the stereotypical images of cherry blossoms and Hello Kitty, and deals with sordid subjects such as crime and prostitution in her work.[7]\\nLoneliness often seems to be a theme in her work, as is the idea that materialism and money have corrupted modern Japanese life, especially where family and romantic relationships are concerned.[2]  In fact, Out has been interpreted as \"a cautionary tale of personal finance\"[9]  and \"a grim portrayal of Japan\\'s underclasses, of its female characters\\' lives, and of the social, sexual, and economic injustice that they face.\"[8]\\nMost of Kirino\\'s novels center upon women and crime. Typically, in her novels, such as Out, Kirino mainly focuses on women who do unimaginable things, which is why her books can be considered as “feminist noir.”[5]  She writes in a convincing, realistic type of way, which leads to the greatness of her work stemming from \"her ability to put us inside the skins of these women.”[5]  This focus on more realistic portrayals of Japanese women seems to be a trademark of her work, found in many of her novels such as Grotesque.[7]   She is also committed to giving women recognition in Japanese literature, where they are often resigned to sexual and domestic roles. The author recounts how a young man once told her that until he read Out, he “never realized that regular middle aged women actually had a life.”[1] Society, she says, takes advantage of powerless women and it is her goal to create empowered female characters to show readers the power of the “weaker sex.”[1]  For these reasons, she has been called the \"queen of Japanese crime.\"[9] In fact, the plot of Out has been described as a framework for her critique of \"the problems of ordinary women in contemporary Japanese society.\"[9]\\nSignificance of Title – \\nKirino explains that the title Out has many meanings attached to it—out as in “off the path” or “exit,” out as in “no good,” and out as in “outside.”[1] She believes there is “a certain kind of freedom in being completely ‘out.’ If you go out one exit, there\\'s another door, and if you open that, you don\\'t know what awaits you\"[1] When asked about the broken bonds in the story, the author says she believes there is no such thing as society and that we are essentially solitary creatures. This becomes clear when people unconsciously release their true nature by committing deviant acts. The book\\'s title clearly conveys the experience of being on the out-side of social groups.\\nReception -\\nOut  had an initial print run of 500,000 in Japan.[2]   Although Kirino received much criticism for her gruesome and disturbing scenes, Out sold a significantly large number of copies, won the Mystery Writers of Japan Award,[1] and was even made into a film directed by Hideyuki Hirayama, which was released in 2002.  According to Variety, New Line Cinema has purchased the rights for an American version, to be directed by Hideo Nakata.[11]\\nResearch -\\nKirino researches her books for approximately six months. For Out, she visited a pathology autopsy class at a university but was not able to view a real corpse. Instead, she interviewed a pathologist and took notes on the details of their operations, such as wearing goggles while dismembering a body due to the flying shards of bone. “In terms of that dismemberment scene,” Kirino says, “I actually was thinking about cooking while I was writing. When I later heard a doctor say that the description of my novel wasn\\'t far off from the way they do it, I was quite relieved.”[1] Regarding characters, none of hers are modeled after real people, and she stresses that her dark characters do not cast a negative light on her own personhood.  Kirino also stated in an LA Weekly interview that \"[While writing] Out, I wanted to understand the experience of [working] at a bento factory. An acquaintance of mine happened to know a person who worked at [one]. So for two nights, I worked the night shift. After that, I just had to escape.\"[12]\\n',\n",

In Hemingway, what\\'s not said is often the whole point of a story. I like that idea, leaving the heart off the page so that the words, the prose itself, is the first thing to pierce you.

Century after century, they committed the same atrocities against one another or against the earth, and the only thing that changed was the magnitude of the slaughter... Conscience was a devil that plagued the individual. Collectively, a people squashed it as easily as stepping on a daisy.Krueger has read the first Ojibwe historian, William Whipple Warren, Gerald Vizenor and Basil Johnston. He has also read novels by Louise Erdrich and Jim Northrup. Krueger began to meet the Ojibwe people and because of his interest in their culture.[8]\\nKrueger believes that the sense of place is made resonant by the actions and emotions of the characters within it. He describes it as \"a dynamic bond that has the potential to heighten the drama of every scene.\"[9]\\n',\n",
       " 'Natsuhiko Kyogoku (京極 夏彦, Kyōgoku Natsuhiko, born March 26, 1963) is a Japanese mystery writer, who is a member of Ōsawa Office.[1] He is a member of the Mystery Writers of Japan and the Honkaku Mystery Writers Club of Japan.[2][3]\\nThree of his novels have been turned into feature films; Mōryō no Hako, which won the 1996 Mystery Writers of Japan Award, was also made into an anime television series, as was Kosetsu Hyaku Monogatari, and his book Loups=Garous was adapted into an anime feature film. Vertical have published his debut novel as The Summer of the Ubume.[4]\\nKyogoku was born in Otaru, Hokkaido. After dropping out of Kuwasawa Design School, he worked as a publicity agent and established a design company. In 1994, Kodansha published his first novel The Summer of the Ubume (姑獲鳥の夏, Ubume no Natsu). He has since written many novels, and received two Japanese literary prizes; Kyogoku won the 16th Yamamoto Shūgorō Prize for Nozoki Koheiji (覘き小平次) in 2003, and won the 130th Naoki Prize for Nochi no Kōsetsu Hyaku Monogatari (後巷説百物語) in 2004.[5]\\nMost of his works are concerned with yōkai, creatures from Japanese folklore; he describes himself as a yōkai researcher. This preference was strongly influenced by Shigeru Mizuki (水木しげる), who is an eminent yokai specialist.[6] Kyogoku participates in Mizuki\\'s World Yōkai Association and is a member of the Kanto Mizuki Association and the Research Institute of Mysterious and Marvelous East Asian phenomena.\\nKyogoku considers yōkai folklore to be a form of sublimation and applied this idea to his novels.[7] His works are often advertised as yōkai novels by the publisher, and their covers reflect this. Nevertheless, in his writing, yōkai themselves don\\'t appear, except as fables, which serve to explicate the criminal characters\\' motives. For example, in The Summer of the Ubume, ubume is introduced as part of a ghostly expectant mother folklore, considered to be an expression of hate.[8] However, ubume doesn\\'t actually appear until the end.\\nIn Kyogoku\\'s works, especially the Kyōgokudō (京極堂) Series, the main character Akihiko Chuzenji (中禅寺 秋彦, Chūzenji Akihiko) solves a case by clearing up a possession; this technique is called Tsukimono-Otoshi, the most striking aspect of his novels. This term is from Onmyōdō: the exorcism of yōkai, demons or ghosts.  Chuzenji does Tsukimono-Otoshi as part of his rhetoric he uses in exposing the criminal character\\'s hidden pathos, and likens the emotion to a particular yōkai folklore. This often solves the mystery, but this result is only an unexpected by-product for Chuzenji.\\nAnother characteristic of his work is book design: cover, thickness and layout. As explained above, he has founded a design company before, and after he became a novelist, has been working as a designer too. Therefore, remarkably for novelists, he is always concerned with the binding process of his works directly, and sometimes designs other novelists\\' books, e.g., Gankyū Kitan (眼球綺譚), Yukito Ayatsuji (綾辻行人).[9]\\nKyogoku\\'s books\\' covers are elaborately designed to match their themes. In Kyōgokudō Series, the covers always represent yōkai featured in each weird story. In Kodansha Novels version of this series, the covers are illustrations drawn by Shirou Tatsumi (辰巳四郎) and Ayako Ishiguro (石黒亜矢子), and in Kodansha Bunko version, the covers are photographs of paper dolls made by Ryō Arai (荒井良). In Kosetsu Hyaku Monogatari Series, the covers also represent yōkai, and as for the first edition of this series, the reverse sides of covers are fearful ukiyo-e which connect the story, e.g., Ono no Komachi Kyūsōzu (小野小町九相図). On the other hand, unlike these horror works, in Dosukoi Series, because these novels are comedies burlesquing other Japanese novels, the covers always represent funny fat sumo wrestlers.\\nAlmost all Kyogoku\\'s books, especially Kyōgokudō Series, are very thick in comparison with other Japanese novels. For example, Tesso no Ori (鉄鼠の檻) is 826 pages long, Jorōgumo no Kotowari (絡新婦の理) is 829 pages long, Nuribotoke no Utage, Utage no Shitaku (塗仏の宴\\u3000宴の支度) and Nuribotoke no Utage, Utage no Shimatsu (塗仏の宴\\u3000宴の始末), a novel in two volumes, is 1248 pages long in total. Because of the thickness, his books look like bricks or dice, and are often called \"brick books\" or \"dice books\".[10]\\nThe layout of Kyogoku\\'s writing is arranged according to his own rules. A sentence never crosses over a page break. Moreover, every time a new version is published, Kyogoku always lays out the work again according to this rule. He explained the intention, \"I made it possible for readers to stop reading whenever they want to. If one sentence steps over, readers who are weary of reading must turn over the page. I sense that is contemptible, because not interest to the story but physical factor force readers to read.\"[11] Second, many kanji characters in his writing are invariably given kana characters alongside. Kyogoku can use DTP software perfectly, so he freely writes old-fashioned characters and ateji characters with the purpose of capturing old Japanese atmosphere in his novels. However, such characters are difficult even for Japanese people to read. Therefore, giving kana characters alongside kanji characters in his writing is essential for readers to be able to understand those characters\\' meaning.[12] Third, sentences are marked out by entering null lines before and after them on purpose. That technique enables readers to perceive the curious blank where the important sentences are written.[13] In these ways, Kyogoku always keeps readability in mind, and dedicates himself not only to sentences but also the layout.[11] These qualities do not, however, carry over to the English translations of his books.\\nKyōgokudō (京極堂) Series[20]\\nKoten Kaisaku (古典改作) Series\\nKōsetsu Hyaku Monogatari (A Hundred Tales of Karma) Series\\n',\n",
       " 'Jean Edith Camilla Läckberg Sköld (Swedish pronunciation: [kaˈmɪ̂lːa ˈlɛ̂kːbærj]; born August 30, 1974) is a Swedish crime writer. As of the early-2010s, her work has been translated into more than 40 languages in 60 countries.[1][2][3] She has been called \"the rock star of Nordic noir.\"[4]\\nLäckberg considers herself a crime writing specialist since discovering such literature on her father\\'s bookshelf at a young age. It has remained a fascination for her ever since.[5] Läckberg\\'s books have received special praise for detail and \"in-depth characterization\".[6] Läckberg – sometimes called the Swedish Agatha Christie[7] – became a writer after her husband and parents enrolled her in a creative writing course as a Christmas present. She describes herself as a visual writer: \"For me actually, specific images – snapshots – come first, and then the story starts to come together from those bits and pieces. I am very visual when I write, I \\'see\\' the story in pictures and writing a book is like having a movie running in my head 24/7.\"[8] Her work has been described as standing \"out for its atmospheric depiction of the Swedish coast, well-drawn characters and (at its best) complex and psychologically nuanced plots.\"[9] In a review of her novel The Preacher (2012) by The Washington Post, the reviewer noted that the \"clever plot and in-depth characterization aren’t the only qualities that elevate “The Preacher” above most other thrillers. There’s also an admirable feel for detail.\"[10] In reviewing her most recent novel (The Golden Cage, 2020), The New York Times described it as a \"smart, unflinching novel.\"[11]\\nLäckberg was born in Fjällbacka, Bohuslän, and started writing at an early age. Her first published work was called \"Tomten\". After graduating from Gothenburg University with a degree in Economics, she moved to Stockholm, where she worked as an economist before beginning writing fiction seriously.[1] She is a business partner in a jewellery company called Sahara Silver Jewelry AB.[12] Hong Kong maternity fashion company Sono Vaso launched in Europe with the then-pregnant author endorsing.[13]\\nLäckberg first married Micke Eriksson; they divorced in 2007. Under Swedish law, as Läckberg\\'s ex-husband, Eriksson was entitled to half the revenue from the contracts signed during their marriage. Eventually it was agreed that she would pay him a lump sum.[14]\\nLäckberg was married for the second time in 2010, to Martin Melin,[15] winner of Expedition Robinson. The two had met at a 2005 release party for one of her books, then began a working relationship. Melin proposed to Läckberg in August 2009.[15]\\nIn 2015, she was engaged to Simon Sköld, MMA fighter and author,[16] and they married in 2017.[citation needed]\\nCamilla Läckberg has four children: Wille and Meja from her first marriage, Charlie from her second, and Polly is from her relationship with Sköld.[17][18] Charlie is also the subject of his mother\\'s first children\\'s book, Super-Charlie.[19]\\nMost of Läckberg\\'s novels feature the crime solving husband-and-wife duo of writer Erica Falck, and police detective Patrik Hedström.\\nThe first four novels were adapted as telemovies between 2007 and 2010, with Elisabet Carlsson and Niklas Hjulström starring as Erica and Patrik.[25][26][27][28]\\nFilming of the TV series Fjällbackamorden began in August 2011 based on the characters from Läckberg\\'s novels, but the stories were new, with actors Claudia Galli and Richard Ulfsäter playing Erica and Patrik.[29]\\nIn 2013, a Swedish film directed by Per Hanefjord titled Tyskungen, and based on Lackberg\\'s 2007\\'s novel of the same name (translated into English as The Hidden Child) was released with \\nGalli and Ulfsäter reprising their roles as Erica and Patrik.[30][31]\\n',\n",

       " \"Dagmar Maria Lange (31 March 1914, Västerås – 9 October 1991, Nora) was a Swedish author of crime fiction under the pen name Maria Lang. She was one of the first detective novelists in the Swedish language, and her books helped make the genre popular in Sweden.[1]\\nLange was born in Västerås to journalist Clas Lange and Elsa Kejser. The family moved to Lindesberg in 1915, when her father was appointed editor and publisher of the newspaper Bergslagernas Tidning. In 1917 her father died from appendicitis, when Dagmar Lange was just two years old. In 1919 her mother married merchant Carl Ivar Olson, and they settled in Nora.[2]\\nLange enrolled as a student of Scandinavian languages in Uppsala in 1933,[3] and from 1934 at Stockholms högskola. The subject for her PhD thesis in 1946 was Pontus Wikner.[4] From 1946 to 1968 she worked at Ahlströmska skolan\\xa0[sv] (Nya Elementarskolan för flickor), a private gymnasium in Stockholm, first as a teacher and eventually as the principal.[5]\\nHer first novel, Mördaren ljuger inte ensam (The Murderer is Not the Only Liar), was published in 1949 and caused some controversy because two of the main characters lived in a homosexual relationship. The book was given a positive review by Barbro Alving in Dagens Nyheter.[6]\\nLange wrote more than 40 detective novels, as well as crime fiction for young adults. Most of her books are set in the fictional Swedish town Skoga, which is based on Lange's home town Nora. She was one of the original 13 members of the Swedish Crime Writers' Academy when it was founded in 1971.\\n\\nThis article about a Swedish writer or poet is a stub.

       " '\\nKarl Stig-Erland \"Stieg\" Larsson (/stiːɡ ˈlɑːrsən/, Swedish: [ˈkɑːɭ stiːɡ ˈæ̌ːɭand ˈlɑ̌ːʂɔn]; 15 August 1954 – 9 November 2004) was a Swedish writer, journalist, and activist.  He is best known for writing the Millennium trilogy of crime novels, which were published posthumously, starting in 2005, after he died of a sudden heart attack. The trilogy was adapted as three motion pictures in Sweden, and one in the U.S. (for the first book only). The publisher commissioned David Lagercrantz to expand the trilogy into a longer series, which has six novels as of September\\xa02019[update]. For much of his life, Larsson lived and worked in Stockholm. His journalistic work covered socialist politics and he acted as an independent researcher of right-wing extremism.\\nHe was the second-best-selling fiction author in the world for 2008, owing to the success of the English translation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, behind the Afghan-American Khaled Hosseini.[1] The third and final novel in the Millennium trilogy, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets\\' Nest, became the bestselling book in the United States in 2010, according to Publishers Weekly.[2] By March 2015, his series had sold 80 million copies worldwide.[3]\\nStieg Larsson was born in Skelleftehamn, Västerbottens län, Sweden, the son of Erland Larsson (born 1935) and his wife Vivianne, née Boström (1937–1991).[4] His father and maternal grandfather worked in the Rönnskärsverken smelting plant in Skelleftehamn. Suffering from arsenic poisoning, his father resigned from his job, and the family subsequently moved to Stockholm. However, because of their cramped living conditions, they chose to let one-year-old Larsson remain behind. Until the age of nine, Larsson lived with his grandparents in a small wooden house in the countryside, near the village of Bjursele in Norsjö Municipality, Västerbotten County.[5] He attended the village school and used cross-country skis to get to and from school during the long, snowy winters in northern Sweden, experiences that he remembered fondly.\\nIn the book \"There Are Things I Want You to Know\" About Stieg Larsson and Me, Eva Gabrielsson describes this as Larsson\\'s motivation for setting part of his first novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in northern Sweden, which Gabrielsson calls \"godforsaken places at the back of beyond.\"[citation needed]\\nLarsson was not as fond of the urban environment in the city Umeå, where he resided with his parents after his grandfather, Severin Boström, died of a heart attack at age 50. \\nLarsson earned a secondary diploma in social sciences in 1972. He applied to the Joint Colleges of Journalism in Stockholm, but he failed the entrance examination. In 1974, Larsson was drafted into the Swedish Army under the conscription law. He spent 16 months in compulsory military service, training as a mortarman in an infantry unit in Kalmar.[citation needed]\\nHis mother Vivianne also died early, in 1991, from complications of breast cancer and an aneurysm.[6]\\nOn his 12th birthday, Larsson\\'s parents gave him a typewriter as a birthday gift.[5]\\nLarsson\\'s first efforts at writing fiction were in the genre of science fiction. As an avid science fiction reader from an early age, he became active in Swedish science-fiction fandom around 1971; he co-edited, with Rune Forsgren, his first fanzine, Sfären, in 1972; and he attended his first science-fiction convention, SF•72, in Stockholm. Through the 1970s, Larsson published around 30 additional fanzine issues; after his move to Stockholm in 1971, he became active in the Scandinavian SF Society, of which he was a board member in 1978 and 1979, and chairman in 1980.\\nIn his first fanzines, 1972–74, he published a handful of early short stories, while submitting others to other semiprofessional or amateur magazines. He was co-editor or editor of several science-fiction fanzines, including Sfären and FIJAGH!; in 1978–79, he was president of the largest Swedish science-fiction fan club, Skandinavisk Förening för Science Fiction. An account of this period in Larsson\\'s life, along with detailed information on his fanzine writing and short stories, is included in the biographical essays written by Larsson\\'s friend John-Henri Holmberg in The Tattooed Girl, by Holmberg with Dan Burstein and Arne De Keijzer, 2011.\\nIn early June 2010, manuscripts for two such stories, as well as fanzines with one or two others, were noted in the Swedish National Library (to which this material had been donated a few years earlier, mainly by the Alvar Appeltofft Memorial Foundation, which works to further science-fiction fandom in Sweden). This discovery of what was called \"unknown\" works by Larsson generated considerable publicity.[7]\\nWhile working as a photographer, Larsson became engaged in far-left political activism. He became a member of Kommunistiska Arbetareförbundet (Communist Workers\\' League),[8] edited the Swedish Trotskyist journal Fjärde internationalen, journal of the Swedish section of the Fourth International. He wrote regularly for the weekly Internationalen.[9]\\nLarsson spent parts of 1977 in Eritrea, training a squad of female Eritrean People\\'s Liberation Front guerrillas in the use of mortars.  He was forced to abandon that work after he contracted a kidney disease.[10] Upon his return to Sweden, he worked as a graphic designer at the largest Swedish news agency, Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå, between 1977 and 1999.[9]\\nLarsson\\'s political convictions, as well as his journalistic experiences, led him to found the Swedish Expo Foundation, similar to the British Searchlight Foundation, established to \"counteract the growth of the extreme right and the white power culture in schools and among young people.\"[11] He also became the editor of the foundation\\'s magazine, Expo, in 1995.\\nWhen he was not at his day job, he worked on independent research into right-wing extremism in Sweden. In 1991, his research resulted in his first book, Extremhögern (The Extreme Right). Larsson quickly became instrumental in documenting and exposing Swedish extreme right and racist organisations. He was an influential debater and lecturer on the subject, reportedly living for years under death threats from his political enemies. The political party Sweden Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna) was a major subject of his research.[11]\\nLarsson\\'s first name was originally Stig, which is the standard spelling. In his early 20s, he changed it to avoid confusion with his friend Stig Larsson, who went on to become a well-known author well before Stieg did.[5][12] The pronunciation is the same regardless of spelling.\\nLarsson died of a heart attack after climbing the stairs to work on 9 November 2004. He was 50. He is interred at the Högalid Church cemetery in the district of Södermalm in Stockholm.[13]\\nIn May 2008, it was announced that a 1977 will, found soon after Larsson\\'s death, declared his wish to leave his assets to the Umeå branch of the Communist Workers League (now the Socialist Party). As the will was unwitnessed, it was not valid under Swedish law, with the result that all of Larsson\\'s estate, including future royalties from book sales, went to his father and brother.[14][15] His long-term partner Eva Gabrielsson,[16] who found the will, had no legal right to the inheritance, sparking controversy between his father and brother and her. Reportedly, the couple never married because, under Swedish law, couples entering into marriage were required to make their addresses (at the time) publicly available, so marrying would have created a security risk.[17]\\nAn article in Vanity Fair discusses Gabrielsson\\'s dispute with Larsson\\'s relatives, which has also been well-covered in the Swedish press. She claims the author had little contact with his father and brother, and requests the rights to control his work so it may be presented in the way he would have wanted.[18] Larsson\\'s story was featured on the 10 October 2010 segment of CBS News Sunday Morning.[19]\\nLarsson had originally planned a series of 10 books and had completed two and most of a third when he began looking for publishers. At the time of his death in 2004, only three had been completed, and although accepted for publication, none had yet been printed. These were published posthumously as the Millennium series.\\nThe first book in the series was published in Sweden as Män som hatar kvinnor (literally \"Men who hate women\") in 2005. It was titled for the English-language market as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and published in the United Kingdom in February 2008.  It was awarded the Glass Key award as the best Nordic crime novel in 2005.\\nHis second novel, Flickan som lekte med elden (2006, The Girl Who Played with Fire), received the Best Swedish Crime Novel Award in 2006 and was published in the United Kingdom in January 2009.\\nThe third novel, Luftslottet som sprängdes (literally \"The castle in the air which was blown up\"), published in English as  The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets\\' Nest, was published in the United Kingdom in October 2009 and the United States in May 2010.\\nLarsson left about three-quarters of a fourth novel on a notebook computer, now possessed by his partner, Eva Gabrielsson; synopses or manuscripts of the fifth and sixth in the series, which he intended to comprise an eventual total of ten books, may also exist.[20] Gabrielsson has stated in her book \"There Are Things I Want You to Know\" About Stieg Larsson and Me (2011) that she feels capable of finishing the book.[21]\\nIn 2013, Swedish publisher Norstedts contracted David Lagercrantz, a Swedish author and journalist, to continue the Millennium series.[22] Lagercrantz did not have access to the material in Gabrielsson\\'s possession, which remains unpublished. The new book was published in August 2015 in connection with the 10-year anniversary of the series, under the Swedish title Det som inte dödar oss (literally \"That which doesn\\'t kill us\"); the English title is The Girl in the Spider\\'s Web.[23][24]\\nThe fifth book in the Millennium series was released in September 2017.  The Swedish title is Mannen som sökte sin skugga (literally \"The man who hunted his shadow\") and the English title is The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye.[25][26]\\nThe sixth book in the Millennium series was released in August 2019.  The Swedish title is Hon som måste dö (literally \"She who must die\") and the English title is The Girl Who Lived Twice.\\nThe Swedish film production company Yellow Bird has produced film versions of the Millennium series, co-produced with the Danish film production company Nordisk Film. The three films were all released in 2009 in Scandinavia.\\nSony Pictures released a film adaptation of the first book in the Millennium series. Directed by David Fincher, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was released in 2011. Plans for sequels were ultimately scrapped.\\nThrough his written works, as well as in interviews, Larsson acknowledged that a significant number of his literary influences were American and British crime/detective fiction authors. His heroine has some similarities with Carol O\\'Connell\\'s \"Mallory\", who first appeared in Mallory\\'s Oracle (1994). In his work Larsson made a habit of inserting the names of some of his favourites within the text, sometimes by making his characters read the works of Larsson\\'s favorite authors. Topping the list were Sara Paretsky, Agatha Christie, Val McDermid, Dorothy Sayers, Elizabeth George, and Enid Blyton.[27]\\nOne of the strongest influences originates from his own country: Pippi Longstocking, by Sweden\\'s much-loved children\\'s author Astrid Lindgren. Larsson explained that one of his main recurring characters in the Millennium series, Lisbeth Salander, is actually fashioned on a grown-up Pippi Longstocking as he chose to sketch her.[28] Additional connections to Lindgren\\'s literary work are in the Larsson novels; for example, the other main character, Mikael Blomkvist, is frequently referred to mockingly by his detractors as \"Kalle Blomkvist\", the name of a fictional teenaged detective created by Lindgren.[29]\\nThe name Salander was actually inspired by the strong female character in the Kalle Blomkvist trilogy by Astrid Lindgren, Kalle\\'s girlfriend Eva-Lotte Lisander.\\nLarsson has said when he was 15 years old, he witnessed three of his friends gang-raping a young girl, which led to his lifelong abhorrence of violence and abuse against women. His longtime partner, Eva Gabrielsson, writes that this incident \"marked him for life\" in a chapter of her book that describes Larsson as a feminist.[6] The author never forgave himself for failing to help the girl, and this inspired the themes of sexual violence against women in his books.[30] According to Gabrielsson, the Millennium trilogy allowed Larsson to express a worldview he was never able to elucidate as a journalist. She described, in great detail, how the fundamental narratives of his three books were essentially fictionalised portraits of the Sweden few people knew, a place where latent white supremacy found expression in all aspects of contemporary life, and anti-extremists lived in persistent fear of attack. \"Everything of this nature described in the Millennium trilogy has happened at one time or another to a Swedish citizen, journalist, politician, public prosecutor, unionist, or policeman,\" she writes. \"Nothing was made up.\"[6][31]\\nSimilarities also exist between Larsson\\'s Lisbeth Salander and Peter O\\'Donnell\\'s Modesty Blaise.[32][33][34] Both are women from disastrous childhoods, who somehow survive to become adults with notable skills, including fighting, and who accomplish good by operating somewhat outside the law. One of Larsson\\'s villains, Ronald Niedermann (blond hulk), has much in common with the invulnerable, sociopathic giant named Simon Delicata in the fourth Modesty Blaise book A Taste for Death.\\nStieg Larsson was the first author to sell more than one million e-books on Amazon.com.[42]\\nKurdo Baksi, Larsson\\'s former colleague at Expo, published Min vän Stieg Larsson (\"My Friend Stieg Larsson\") in January 2010.[43]\\nBarry Forshaw\\'s English language biography was published in April 2010.[44]\\nLarsson\\'s widow Eva Gabrielsson released her memoir Millennium, Stieg & jag in 2011,[45] published in English the same year as \"There Are Things I Want You to Know\" About Stieg Larsson and Me.\\nIn 2018 a study by Jan Stocklassa of Larsson\\'s research into Olof Palme\\'s assassination was released in Swedish,[46] and in English the following year, translated by Tara F. Chace, under the title The Man Who Played with Fire: Stieg Larsson\\'s Lost Files and the Hunt for an Assassin.[47]\\nSince 2009 Larsson\\'s family and Norstedts have instituted an annual award of 200,000 Swedish Krona (US$18,668 in 2022 terms) in memory of him. The prize is awarded to a person or organisation working in Stieg Larsson\\'s spirit.\\nThe recipient in 2015 was Chinese author Yang Jisheng for his notable work  Tombstone which describes the consequences of The Three Years of Great Chinese Famine.[48]\\nThe Millennium series:\\nScience fiction fanzines:\\nOther:\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\"Rejecting Jane\" is the title of a 2007 article by British author David Lassman.[1][2] The article, which was published in Issue 28 of Jane Austen\\'s Regency World magazine,[3] is a critique of the publishing industry through their inadvertent rejection of Jane Austen.[4][5]\\nUsing the pseudonym \\'Alison Laydee\\'\\xa0– a play on Austen\\'s original pen name \"A Lady\"[5]\\xa0– Lassman sent out the opening chapters of Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion to several major publishers and literary agents, with different titles but only minor changes to the text, such as character names and locations. The resultant article discussed how all but one of the publishers and agents failed to recognise her works, including Penguin Books and Bloomsbury, with the vast majority rejecting the attempt to gain a publishing deal. This was also despite Pride and Prejudice\\'s opening line, \"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife,\" being left intact.[5]\\nOn its publication the article created worldwide media coverage,[1][5][6][7][8][9] which saw its author appear on radio and television programmes across the globe, including American news programmes and TV talk shows such as Good Morning America.[7]\\n',\n",
       " 'Dennis Lehane (born August 4, 1965)[1] is an American author. He has published more than a dozen novels; the first several were a series of mysteries featuring recurring characters, including A Drink Before the War. Four of his novels were adapted as films of the same names: Clint Eastwood\\'s Mystic River (2003), Martin Scorsese\\'s Shutter Island (2010), and Gone Baby Gone (2007) and Live by Night (2016), both directed by Ben Affleck. His short story \"Animal Rescue\" was also adapted into the film The Drop, noted for being the final film role for actor James Gandolfini.\\nLehane was born and raised in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. He lived in the Boston area most of his life, where he sets most of his books, but now lives in southern California.[2] He spent summers on Fieldston Beach in Marshfield.[3] Lehane is the youngest of five children. His father was a foreman for Sears & Roebuck, and his mother worked in a Boston public school cafeteria.[4]  Both of his parents emigrated from Ireland.[5] Lehane is a graduate of Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida.\\nHis brother, Gerry Lehane, who is two and a half years older than Dennis, trained at the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence and became an actor in New York in 1990. Gerry is a member of the Invisible City Theatre Company.[6]\\nLehane is married to Chisa Lehane. He has two children from a previous marriage. \\nHe is a graduate of Boston College High School (a Jesuit prep school),[5] Eckerd College (where he found his passion for writing),[citation needed] and the graduate program in creative writing at Florida International University in Miami, Florida. He occasionally made guest appearances as himself in the ABC comedy/drama TV series Castle.\\nLehane\\'s first novel, A Drink Before the War (1994), which introduced the recurring characters Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, won the 1995 Shamus Award for Best First P.I. Novel. The fourth novel in the series, Gone, Baby, Gone, was adapted into a film of the same title in 2007; it was directed by Ben Affleck and starred Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan as Kenzie and Gennaro. Commenting on the movie after a sneak peek, Lehane said, \"I saw the movie and it\\'s terrific, I wasn\\'t gonna say anything if I didn\\'t like it but it\\'s really terrific.\"[7] Reportedly, Lehane \"has never wanted to write the screenplays for the films [based on his own books], because he says he has \\'no desire to operate on my own child.\\'\"[3]\\nLehane\\'s novel Mystic River was adapted into a film in 2003; also called Mystic River and directed by Clint Eastwood, it starred Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon. Lehane can be briefly seen waving from a car in the parade scene at the end of the film. The novel itself was a finalist for the PEN/Winship Award and won the Anthony Award and the Barry Award for Best Novel, the Massachusetts Book Award in Fiction, and France\\'s Prix Mystère de la critique.\\nLehane\\'s first play, Coronado, debuted in New York in December 2005, produced by Invisible City Theater Company. The play had its regional premiere at American Stage in St. Petersburg in April 2006[8] and its Midwest premiere in the fall of 2007 with Steep Theatre Company in Chicago. Coronado is based on his acclaimed short story Until Gwen,[9] which was originally published in The Atlantic Monthly and was selected for both The Best American Short Stories and The Best Mystery Short Stories of 2005.[6]\\nLehane described working on his historical novel, The Given Day,[10] as \"a five- or six-year project.\" the novel opens in 1918 and encompasses the 1919 Boston Police Strike and its aftermath.[11] According to Lehane, \"The strike changed everything.

That\\'s all linked to what\\'s going on now.\".[11] While Lehane\\'s epic novel centers on the 1919 Boston police strike, it contains a national sweep and may be the first of a trilogy or perhaps a four-book series.[12] Lehane called the novel his \"great white whale\" and said that when he finally finished it, he would \"either write a sequel—or take a break from the cops and return to Patrick and Angie.\"[7] The novel was published in October 2008.[13]\\nOn October 22, 2007, Paramount Pictures announced that they had optioned Shutter Island with Martin Scorsese attached as director.[14] The Laeta Kalogridis-scripted adaptation has Leonardo DiCaprio playing U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels, \"who is investigating the disappearance of a murderess who escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane and is presumed to be hiding on the remote Shutter Island.\"[15] Mark Ruffalo played opposite DiCaprio as U.S. Marshal Chuck Aule.[16] Production started in March 2008; Shutter Island was released on February 19, 2010.\\nIn 2010 Lehane published Moonlight Mile, his sixth book in the Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro series, and his first of that genre in 11 years.[17] He published World Gone By in March 2015.\\nLehane was appointed to the board of trustees of the Boston Public Library by Mayor Thomas Menino in December 2011.[18]\\nLehane\\'s Small Mercies received praise from Richard Russo, who said: \"Think of all your favorite hard-boiled authors (Hammett?

       " '\\nPaul J. Levine (born January 9, 1948) is an American author of crime fiction, particularly legal thrillers. Levine has written 22 mystery novels which include two series of books known by the names of the protagonists. The Jake Lassiter series follows the former football player turned Miami lawyer in a series of fourteen books published over a thirty-year span beginning in 1990. The four-book Solomon vs. Lord series published in the mid-2000s features Steve Solomon and Victoria Lord, a pair of bickering Miami attorneys who were rivals before they became law partners and lovers. Levine has also written four stand-alone novels and 20 episodes of the television drama series JAG. With JAG executive producer Don Bellisario, he also created and produced First Monday, a 2002 CBS series inspired by one of Levine\\'s novels.\\nBorn in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Levine graduated from Pennsylvania State University and was a reporter for the Miami Herald early in his career. He then graduated from the University of Miami School of Law and was an attorney in Florida for 17 years before becoming an author.\\nPaul J. Levine was born on January 9, 1948, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to Sally and Stanley Levine, both retail merchants.[2] Stanley Levine served in World War II as a lieutenant in the United States Army Air Forces. A radar officer on a B-29, he was shot down over Japan during a bombing raid and, as a prisoner of war, was one of the first Americans to see the ruins of Hiroshima.[3][4]\\nPaul Levine graduated in 1969 with a B.A. in journalism from Pennsylvania State University,[5] where he was editor in chief of the newspaper The Daily Collegian.[6][7] At the University of Miami School of Law, he was on the 1971 championship team at the National Moot Court Competition, contributed to the University of Miami Law Review, and graduated cum laude in 1973.[8]\\nLevine began his career working for the Miami Herald in 1969 as a courthouse reporter,[9][10] and writing for Tropic, the newspaper\\'s Sunday magazine.[11] As a law student, he worked part-time for The Miami News and the Los Angeles Times.[5]\\nAfter graduating from law school, Levine was admitted to The Florida Bar in 1973. From 1978 to 1987, Levine was an attorney and partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius.[10] He also worked, pro bono, for the Florida First Amendment Foundation. As an attorney for the foundation, he represented The Florida Star on appeal before Florida First District Court of Appeal after a rape victim won a $100,000 verdict against the newspaper for publishing her name.[12][13] The Supreme Court of the United States overturned the verdict in 1989, holding that the imposition of damages for truthfully publishing public information violates the First Amendment.[14] In 1987, he became counsel to Spence, Payne, Masington, Grossman and Needle, which later became Grossman and Roth, both Miami law firms.[10][15]\\nWhile practicing law, Levine also served as a legal commentator for WPLG-TV and WTVJ-TV in Miami and wrote and appeared on You & the Law, a television program syndicated by Newsweek Broadcasting. He taught communications law as an adjunct lecturer at the University of Miami School of Law.[10] After 17 years as an attorney, Levine stopped practicing law to pursue a career as an author.[16][17]\\nLevine published his first novel, To Speak for the Dead, with Bantam Books in 1990.[18][19] In the first book of the Jake Lassiter series, the ex-linebacker turned attorney defends a surgeon in a malpractice lawsuit in a plot involving \"kinky sex and murder for money.\"[9][20] In January 1995, his debut book was made into a TV Movie produced by Stephen J. Cannell for NBC, Jake Lassiter: Justice on the Bayou, in which Lassiter is portrayed by Gerald McRaney.[21][22] The character has been favorably compared to others in film and mystery writing. Lassiter was described by the Miami Herald as having \"a lot more charisma than [Perry Mason] ever did.\"[23] The Los Angeles Times described Lassiter as \"Travis McGee with [a law degree].\"[19]\\nAfter gaining \"some acclaim and modest success\" with his first book, Levine\\'s second book, Night Vision, was published in 1991.[24] In this installment, Lassiter serves as special prosecutor on a serial murder case.[10] This was followed by False Dawn (1993),[25] in which Lassiter faces \"a beautiful Finnish spy, Japanese art smugglers, CIA double agents, and Cuban exiles.\"[26] Newgate Callendar in a New York Times review wrote that False Dawn\\'s \"plot is fairly complicated, but the story never gets lost, and Mr. Levine tells it in a realistic, gritty manner.\"[27]\\nIn 1994, Levine released the fourth book in the series, Mortal Sin,[28][29] which Jean Heller in the St. Petersburg Times described as \"the best\", adding that the \"escapade is populated with nicely drawn characters, new and used, and mayhem enough for anyone.\"[30] In Mortal Sin, Lassiter becomes involved with his former lover whose fiancé he also represents in a murder trial.[26]\\nSlashback in 1995 continued the series and marks a shift in the author\\'s writing style, from first-person to third-person narration.[21] This was followed, in 1996, by Fool Me Twice which has Lassiter accused of murder while he searches for a client that has gone missing.[16] In Flesh and Bones (1997), Lassiter defends a woman who shot her father, claiming he abused her as a child.[31]\\n9 Scorpions (1998) was the first book by Levine not to include Lassiter. The protagonist, Lisa Freemont, is a young law clerk working for the newest appointee to the Supreme Court.[32] Oline H. Cogdill wrote in the Sun-Sentinel that \"9 Scorpions\\' plot relies too heavily on a series of coincidences and what-ifs that undermine the novel\\'s realism\" but it \"is on firmest ground when Levine is showing us the inner workings of the Supreme Court, the collision of the Justices\\' personalities and beliefs and the law clerks\\' influence.\"[33] Originally published by Pocket Books,[34] Levine later re-released the book under a new title, Impact.[35]\\nIn 1999, Levine moved to Los Angeles, California, to become a television writer. He was hired by executive producer Don Bellisario to join the writing staff of JAG, a military legal drama on CBS.[36] Levine wrote 20 episodes of JAG.[37] 9 Scorpions became the inspiration for First Monday, a 2002 CBS series Levine created and produced with Bellisario.[38][39]\\nThe 2005 novel Solomon vs. Lord started a new series of books for Levine[38][40] and introduced bickering Miami lawyers Steve Solomon and Victoria Lord.[41] In that first novel, the couple teams up to defend a wealthy widow accused of murdering her husband.[40][42] The Chicago Sun-Times\\' review described the novel as \"[r]emarkably fresh and original with characters you can\\'t help loving and sparkling dialog that echoes the Hepburn–Tracy screwball comedies.\"[43] Three more of Levine\\'s legal capers featured the seemingly mismatched partners. In The Deep Blue Alibi (2006), they defend a client in a Key West murder trial[38][40] which leads the couple to a nudist resort to investigate.[44] In Kill All the Lawyers (2006), a former client of Solomon believes the lawyer sabotaged his case and comes back for revenge.[45] In Trial and Error (2007), since re-titled Habeas Porpoise, Solomon and Lord find themselves on opposing sides of a case involving kidnapped dolphins when Lord is appointed as a special prosecutor.[46][47][48]\\nLevine\\'s novel, Illegal (2009), featured Jimmy (Royal) Payne, a down-on-his-luck Los Angeles lawyer who is caught up in a human trafficking scheme.[49][50] Calling the book a \"riveting read,\" Booklist noted: \"The portrait of the dangers and predations that Latinos face crossing the border is chilling and rings with authenticity.\"[51] Levine\\'s 2011 novel Ballistic takes on a new subject for the author where a doomsday religious cult occupies a nuclear missile silo and attempts to launch a missile targeting Jerusalem.[52] In Paydirt (2012), Levine tells the story of a former lawyer who loses his career and decides to use his 12-year-old genius son to fix the outcome of the Super Bowl.[53]\\nAfter a fourteen-year hiatus, Levine returned to the Jake Lassiter series in his 2011 novel Lassiter in which the main character is accused of being involved in the disappearance of a girl years earlier.[54] The series continued with State vs. Lassiter (2013) in which Lassiter is charged with killing his lover, a banker, to allegedly cover up skimming from trust-fund accounts.[55]\\nThis was followed by three more novels, Bum Rap (2015),[56] Bum Luck (2017),[57] and Bum Deal (2018),[58] that included characters from the Solomon vs. Lord series. In Bum Rap, Lassiter works with Lord to find a way to exonerate Solomon who has been charged with murdering a Russian club owner.[59][60] In Bum Luck, Lassiter bizarrely threatens to kill his own client who has just been acquitted of murder. Solomon and Lord fear that Lassiter has suffered brain damage (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) from his days as a football player.[57] Bum Luck also introduced Dr. Melissa Gold, the neuropathologist treating Lassiter,[61] who later becomes his fiancée.[62] In Bum Deal, Dr. Gold administers experimental brain treatments to Lassiter who has been appointed a special prosecutor to try a high-profile murder case arguing against Solomon and Lord.[58][63]\\nIn Cheater\\'s Game (2020), Lassiter tackles a college admissions scandal, akin to the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal, when he defends his nephew who\\'s been charged with taking students\\' College Board exams as an imposter. The novel concludes with a federal trial described by Booklist as \"one seismic courtroom battle... an occasion for pyrotechnics that really blaze.\"[64][65]\\nLevine was the recipient of the second John D. MacDonald Award for Excellence in Florida Fiction.[66] Solomon vs. Lord was nominated for the \"best novel\" category of the Macavity Awards by Mystery Readers International and for the Thurber Prize for American Humor.[45][54] The Deep Blue Alibi was nominated for an International Thriller Writers Award[67] and the 2007 Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America.[68] State vs. Lassiter was nominated for the Shamus Award from the Private Eye Writers of America.[69]\\nHe received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the Pennsylvania State University[5] and the Alumni Achievement Award from the University of Miami School of Law.[70]\\nLevine is married to Marcia Silvers, a criminal appellate attorney.[56] They live in Santa Barbara, California.[62] Levine has a daughter and a son from previous marriages.[2]\\nJake Lassiter series\\n\\nSolomon vs. Lord series\\nOthers\\nShort story anthology\\n\\n',\n",

Signing up for the third year – National Service was ordinarily for two years – enabled him to train, and obtain better pay, as an Education Officer.

He grew up in New York City and fought in Europe during World War II, earning a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He studied chemistry (Bachelor\\'s degree in 1949) and journalism (Master\\'s degree in 1951). After working as a magazine editor in New York, he moved to California in 1965 to write full-time.  Married to thriller author Gayle Lynds, he lived in California until his death.\\nWritten under the \"Michael Collins\" pen name, his Dan Fortune stories constitute one of the longest-running private detective series written, beginning in 1967 with Act of Fear, which earned a 1968 Edgar Award, for Best First Novel. As Collins, Lynds is largely credited with bringing the detective novel into the modern age:  \\n\"After naming Lynds the Best Suspense writer of the 1970s\", Baker and Nietzel continue, the Crime Literature Association of West Germany praised him as follows:\\nBaker and Nietzel point out a popular phenomenon that began with Collins\\'s first book: \"Act of Fear ... inspired the by-now monotonous chant by critics about each new hard-boiled author being \\'the best since Hammett,\\' \\'the new Chandler,\\' and \\'the heir to Ross Macdonald.\\' Fortune enjoys a senior status among modern private eyes\", predating Lawrence Block, Robert Parker, Elmore Leonard, Joseph Hansen, Joe Gores, Michael Lewin, and Bill Pronzini.\\nAs Michael Collins, he also wrote two science fiction novels, Lukan War in 1969, and its sequel, The Planets of Death, in 1970. Both novels are about mercenaries in a future where they are despised and reviled by most people.  When suddenly the society is attacked by a very dangerous enemy, they are called upon to fight and die to protect the same people who were treating them so badly not long before.\\nBeginning in 1968 with The Mystery of the Moaning Cave and ending in 1989 with Hot Wheels, Lynds wrote fourteen novels under the pen name William Arden for the juvenile detective series The Three Investigators, which was originated by Robert Arthur, Jr.  Under this same name, he also wrote five novels featuring private eye Kane Jackson, a former military policeman who has become an industrial security specialist after leaving the military.  The first Jackson novel, A Dark Power, appeared in 1968.  As Arden, Lynds also wrote the highly regarded espionage short story \"Success of a Mission,\" which was a finalist for the 1968 Edgar Award for best short fiction.\\nProlific, explaining that he had more ideas than he knew what to do with, in addition to his Collins name, he created additional series under the pseudonyms Mark Sadler, John Crowe, and Carl Dekker.  For a few years, he published under three of these pseudonyms at the same time at three different publishing houses — Dodd Mead, Random House, and Bobbs-Merrill. For many years, The New York Times listed his books annually as among the nation’s top mysteries. One year, two appeared on the same list, each written under a different pseudonym. He also penned 8 Belmont Books mass-market paperbacks of The Shadow from 1964 to 1967 under the Shadow\\'s author by-line Maxwell Grant.\\nAs he was writing detective novels, he also published literary books and some 100 literary short stories. Five of the stories were honored in Best American Short Stories. He was twice short-listed for the Drue Heinz Literature Prize. His mystery and detective short stories have appeared in Best Crime & Mystery Stories of the Year many times. Twice he was the guest of honor at literary festivals in France honoring the American detective novel.\\nIn the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Lynds\\'s work took another turn. He began lacing his detective novels with short stories, biographies, and symbolic vignettes, a literary technique that recent mystery writers have copied and expanded.  Critic Richard C. Carpenter discussed it in Twentieth Century Crime and Mystery Writers:\\n',\n",

       " '\\nJohn Dann MacDonald (July 24, 1916\\xa0– December 28, 1986) was an American writer of novels and short stories. He is known for his thrillers.\\nMacDonald was a prolific author of crime and suspense novels, many set in his adopted home of Florida. One of the most successful American novelists of his time, MacDonald sold an estimated 70 million books.[1] His best-known works include the popular and critically acclaimed Travis McGee series and his 1957 novel The Executioners, which was filmed as Cape Fear (1962) and remade in 1991.\\nMacDonald was born in Sharon, Pennsylvania, where his father, Eugene Macdonald, worked for the Savage Arms Corporation. The family relocated to Utica, New York in 1926, his father becoming treasurer of the Utica office of Savage Arms. In 1934, MacDonald was given a choice by his father: spend another year in school as a post-graduate, or go to Europe for several weeks. He chose Europe and this began an interest in travel and photography.\\nAfter graduating from high school, he enrolled at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, but he quit during his sophomore year. MacDonald worked at menial jobs in New York City, then was admitted to Syracuse University, where he met his future wife, Dorothy Prentiss. They married secretly in Pennsylvania in 1937, and had a public ceremony in Utica later that year. He graduated from Syracuse University the next year. The couple had one son, Maynard.\\nIn 1939, MacDonald received an MBA from Harvard University. MacDonald later used his education in business and economics in crafting his fiction. Several of his novels are either set in the business world or involve shady financial or real estate deals.\\nIn 1940, MacDonald accepted a direct commission as a first lieutenant of the United States Army Ordnance Corps. During World War II, he served in the Office of Strategic Services in the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations; this region featured in many of his earlier short stories and novels. He was discharged in September 1945 as a lieutenant colonel. \"Dear Dordo: The World War II Letters of Dorothy and John D. MacDonald\" was published by Peppertree Press in 2022.\\nIn 1951 he moved his family from Utica, New York to Florida, eventually settling in Sarasota.\\nMacDonald\\'s first published short story, \"G-Robot,\" appeared in the July 1936 Double Action Gang magazine.[2]  Following his 1945 discharge from the army, MacDonald spent four months writing short stories, generating some 800,000 words and losing 20 pounds (9.1\\xa0kg) while typing 14 hours a day, seven days a week. He received hundreds of rejection slips, but \"Cash on the Coffin!\" appeared in the May 1946 pulp magazine Detective Tales.[3] He would eventually sell nearly 500 short stories to various mystery and adventure fiction magazines.[4]  Selections from MacDonald\\'s early magazine fiction, somewhat revised, were later republished in two collections, The Good Old Stuff (1982) and More Good Old Stuff (1984), \\nStarting with The Brass Cupcake in 1950, McDonald wrote more than forty standalone crime thrillers and domestic dramas, most published as paperback originals and many of them set in Florida. Among them was The Executioners (1957), which was filmed twice as Cape Fear and later republished under that title. MacDonald also wrote three science fiction novels, including The Girl, the Gold Watch & Everything (1962), which was filmed for television.   After introducing his series character Travis McGee in 1964, MacDonald concentrated mostly on that series, although he did publish four additional standalone novels.\\nIn 1964, MacDonald published The Deep Blue Good-by, the first of 21 novels starring Travis McGee, a self-described \"salvage consultant\" who recovers stolen property for a fee of 50 percent, and who narrates his adventures in the first person. McGee originally was to be called Dallas McGee, but MacDonald dropped that name after the Kennedy assassination, borrowing instead the name of Travis Air Force Base.[5]  The McGee adventures, each of which has a color in the title, mostly play out in Florida (where McGee lives a hedonistic bachelor life on a houseboat), the Caribbean, or Mexico, and many of them feature his friend and sidekick Dr. Meyer (\"Just \\'Meyer\\', please\") Meyer, a renowned economist who helps Travis deconstruct elaborate swindles and cases of business corruption.\\nFollowing complications of coronary artery bypass surgery, MacDonald slipped into a coma on December 10, 1986. He died at the age of seventy, on December 28, in St. Mary\\'s Hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[6] He is buried in Poland, New York.[7] He was survived by his wife Dorothy (1911-1989) and a son, Maynard.\\nMost current Floridian mystery writers acknowledge a debt to MacDonald, including Randy Wayne White, James Hall, Les Standiford, Jonathon King and Tim Dorsey.[11] In 1972, the Mystery Writers of America bestowed upon MacDonald its highest honor, the Grand Master Award for lifetime achievement and consistent quality. Stephen King praised MacDonald as \"the great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller.\"[12] Kingsley Amis said MacDonald \"is by any standards a better writer than Saul Bellow, only MacDonald writes thrillers and Bellow is a human-heart chap, so guess who wears the top-grade laurels.\"[13]\\nIn a May 2016 The New York Times interview, author Nathaniel Philbrick said: \"I recently discovered John D. MacDonald’s Travis McGee series. Every time I finish one of those slender books, I tell myself it’s time to take a break and return to the pile on the night stand but then find myself deep into another McGee novel. Before there were Lee Child and Carl Hiaasen, there was MacDonald — as prescient and verbally precise as anyone writing today can possibly hope to be.\"[14]\\nIn the novels, McGee had his lodgings on his 52-foot (16\\xa0m) houseboat, the Busted Flush, docked at Slip F-18, marina Bahia Mar, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In 1987, the Friends of Libraries U.S.A. installed a \"literary landmark plaque\" around what would be Slip F-18 in Bahia Mar. After the docks were remodeled, the plaque was moved to the Dockmaster\\'s office.[15]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nRoss Macdonald was the main pseudonym used by the American-Canadian writer of crime fiction Kenneth Millar (/ˈmɪlər/; December\\xa013, 1915 – July 11, 1983). He is best known for his series of hardboiled novels set in Southern California and featuring private detective Lew Archer. Since the 1970s, Macdonald\\'s works (particularly the Archer novels) have received attention in academic circles[1][2][3] for their psychological depth,[4][5] sense of place,[6][7][8] use of language,[9] sophisticated imagery[10] and integration of philosophy into genre fiction.[11]\\nBrought up in the province of Ontario, Canada, Macdonald eventually settled in the state of California, where he died in 1983.\\nMillar was born in Los Gatos, California, and raised in his Canadian parents\\' native Kitchener, Ontario. Millar was a Scots spelling of the surname Miller, and the author pronounced his name Miller rather than Millar.[12] When his father abandoned the family unexpectedly when Millar was four years old, he and his mother lived with various relatives, and he had moved several times by his 16th year. Back in Canada as a young adult, he returned to Kitchener, where he studied, and subsequently graduated from the University of Western Ontario with an Honors degree in History and English. He found work as a high school teacher.[13] Some years later, he attended the University of Michigan and received a PhD in 1952. He married Margaret Sturm in 1938, though they\\'d known each other earlier in high school. They had a daughter in 1939, Linda, who died in 1970.[14][15] The family moved from Kitchener to Santa Barbara in 1946.[16]\\nMillar began his career writing stories for pulp magazines and used his real name for his first four novels. Of these he completed the first, The Dark Tunnel, in 1944. After serving at sea as a naval communications officer from 1944 to 1946, Millar returned to Michigan, where he obtained his Ph.D. degree in literature.[17] For his doctorate, Millar studied under poet W.H. Auden, who (unusually for a prominent literary intellectual of the era) held mystery or detective fiction could rise to the level of literature and encouraged Millar\\'s interest in the genre.[12]\\nFor his fifth novel, in 1949, he wrote under the name John Macdonald (his father\\'s first and middle names) in order to avoid confusion with his wife, who was achieving her own success writing as Margaret Millar. He then changed his pen name briefly to John Ross Macdonald, before settling on Ross Macdonald (Ross borrowed from a favorite cousin) in order to avoid being confused with fellow mystery writer John D. MacDonald, who was writing under his real name.[12]  Millar would use the pseudonym \"Ross Macdonald\" on all his fiction from the mid \\'50s forward.[15]\\nMost of his books were set primarily in and around his adopted hometown of Santa Barbara. In these works, the city where Lew Archer is based goes under the fictional name of Santa Teresa.\\nIn 1983 Macdonald died of Alzheimer\\'s disease.[14]\\nMacdonald first introduced the tough but humane private eye Lew Archer in the 1946 short story \"Find the Woman\" (credited then to \"Ken Millar\"). A full-length novel featuring him, The Moving Target, followed in 1949 and was the first in a series of eighteen. Macdonald mentions in the foreword to the Archer in Hollywood omnibus that his detective derives his name from Sam Spade\\'s partner, Miles Archer, and from Lewis Wallace, author of Ben-Hur, though the character was patterned on Philip Marlowe. Macdonald also stated the surname \"Archer\" was inspired by his own astrological sign of Sagittarius the archer.[12]\\nThe novels were hailed by genre fans and literary critics alike.[18] The Lew Archer novels are recognized as some of the most significant American mystery books of the mid 20th century, bringing a literary sophistication to the genre. The critic John Leonard declared that Macdonald had surpassed the limits of crime fiction to become \"a major American novelist\".[19] He has also been called the primary heir to Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler as the master of American hardboiled mysteries.[20]\\nMacdonald\\'s writing built on the pithy style of his predecessors by adding psychological depth and insights into the motivations of his characters.[21] Their plots of \"baroque splendor\" were complicated and often turned on Archer\\'s unearthing family secrets of upwardly mobile clients, sometimes going back over several generations.[22] Lost or wayward sons and daughters were a theme common to many of the novels.[23] Critics have commented favorably on Macdonald\\'s deft combination of the two sides of the mystery genre, the \"whodunit\" and the psychological thriller.[24] Even his regular readers seldom saw a Macdonald denouement coming.\\nScreenwriter William Goldman, who adapted Macdonald\\'s The Moving Target to film as Harper in 1966, called his works \"the finest series of detective novels ever written by an American\".[25] A later film adaptation was The Drowning Pool (1975), also starring Paul Newman as the detective \"Lew Harper\".[26] In addition, The Underground Man was adapted as a TV movie in 1974.[27]\\nTom Nolan, in his Ross Macdonald, A Biography,[12] wrote, \"By any standard he was remarkable. His first books, patterned on Hammett and Chandler, were at once vivid chronicles of a postwar California and elaborate retellings of Greek and other classic myths. Gradually he swapped the hard-boiled trappings for more subjective themes: personal identity, the family secret, the family scapegoat, the childhood trauma; how men and women need and battle each other, how the buried past rises like a skeleton to confront the present. He brought the tragic drama of Freud and the psychology of Sophocles to detective stories, and his prose flashed with poetic imagery.\"\\n\\nIn a 2017 book review, the Wall Street Journal provided this summary of the author\\'s style:\"... it is the sheer beauty of Macdonald’s laconic style—with its seductive rhythms and elegant plainness—that holds us spellbound. \\'Hard-boiled,\\' \\'noir,\\' \\'mystery,\\' it doesn’t matter what you call it. Macdonald, with insolent grace, blows past the barrier constructed by Dorothy Sayers between \\'the literature of escape\\' and \\'the literature of expression.\\' These novels, triumphs of his literary alchemy, dare to be both.\"[28]According to the New York Times, \"some critics ranked him among the best American novelists of his generation.\" William Goldman, in the newspaper\\'s Book Review section, wrote that the Archer books were \"the finest series of detective novels ever written by an American\".[29]\\nOver his career, Macdonald was presented with several awards. In 1964, the Mystery Writers of America awarded the author the Silver Dagger award for \"The Chill.\" Ten years later, he received the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America, and in 1982 he received \"The Eye,\" the Lifetime Achievement Shamus Award from the Private Eye Writers of America. In 1982, he was awarded the Robert Kirsch Award by the Los Angeles Times for \"an outstanding body of work by an author from the West or featuring the West.\"[30]\\nThese first four novels, all non-series standalones, were initially published using Millar\\'s real name,  but have since been intermittently reissued using his literary pseudonym, Ross Macdonald.\\nTwo later non-series novels were also published:\\nAllison & Busby published three Archer omnibus editions in the 1990s.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nHenning Georg Mankell (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈhɛ̂nːɪŋ ˈmǎŋːkɛl]; 3\\xa0February 1948\\xa0– 5\\xa0October 2015) was a Swedish crime writer, children\\'s author, and dramatist, best known for a series of mystery novels starring his most noted creation, Inspector Kurt Wallander. He also wrote a number of plays and screenplays for television.\\nHe was a left-wing social critic and activist. In his books and plays he constantly highlighted social inequality issues and injustices in Sweden and abroad. In 2010, Mankell was on board one of the ships in the Gaza Freedom Flotilla that was boarded by Israeli commandos. He was below deck on the MV Mavi Marmara when nine civilians were killed in international waters.\\nMankell shared his time between Sweden and countries in Africa, mostly Mozambique where he started a theatre. He made considerable donations to charity organizations, mostly connected to Africa.\\nMankell\\'s grandfather, also named Henning Mankell, lived from 1868 to 1930 and was a composer.[1] Mankell was born in Stockholm, Sweden in 1948. His father Ivar was a lawyer who divorced his mother when Mankell was one year old. He and an older sister lived with his father for most of their childhood. The family first lived in Sveg, Härjedalen in northern Sweden, where Mankell\\'s father was a district judge. In the biography on Mankell\\'s website, he describes this time when they lived in a flat above the court as one of the happiest in his life.[2] In Sveg, a museum was built in his honour during his lifetime.[3]\\nLater, when Mankell was thirteen, the family moved to Borås, Västergötland on the Swedish west coast near Gothenburg.[2] After three years he dropped out of school and went to Paris when he was 16. Shortly afterwards he joined the merchant marine, working on a cargo ship and he \"loved the ship\\'s decent hard-working community\".[2] In 1966, he returned to Paris to become a writer. He took part in the student uprising of 1968. He later returned to work as a stagehand in Stockholm.[3] At the age of 20, he had already started as author at the National Swedish Touring Theatre in Stockholm.[4] In the following years he collaborated with several theatres in Sweden. His first play, The Amusement Park dealt with Swedish colonialism in South America.[2] In 1973, he published The Stone Blaster, a novel about the Swedish labour movement. He used the proceeds from the novel to travel to Guinea-Bissau. Africa would later become a second home to him, and he spent a big part of his life there. When his success as a writer made it possible, he founded and ran a theatre in Mozambique.[2]\\nFrom 1991 to 2013, Mankell wrote the books which made him famous worldwide, the Kurt Wallander mystery novels. Wallander was a fictional detective living in Ystad in southern Sweden, who supervised a squad of detectives in solving murders, some of which were bizarre. As they worked to catch a killer who had to be stopped before he could kill again, the team often worked late into the nights in a heightened atmosphere of tension and crisis. Wallander\\'s thoughts and worries about his daughter, his health, his lack of friends and a social life, his worries about Swedish society, shared his mental life with his many concerns and worries about the case he was working. There were ten books in the series. They were translated into many languages and sold millions of copies worldwide. The series gave Mankell the freedom and wherewithal to pursue other projects which interested him.\\nAfter living in Zambia and other African countries, Mankell was invited from 1986 onward to become the artistic director of Teatro Avenida in Maputo, Mozambique. He subsequently spent extended periods in Maputo working with the theatre and as a writer. He built his own publishing house, Leopard Förlag, in order to support young talented writers from Africa and Sweden.[5] His novel Chronicler of the Winds, published in Sweden as Comédie infantil in 1995, reflects African problems and is based on African storytelling.[6] On 12\\xa0June 2008, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate from the University of St Andrews in Scotland \"in recognition of his major contribution to literature and to the practical exercise of conscience\".[7]\\nAround 2008, Mankell developed two original stories for the German police series Tatort. Actor Axel Milberg, who portrays Inspector Klaus Borowski, had asked Mankell to contribute to the show when they were promoting The Man from Beijing audiobook, a project that Milberg had worked on. The episodes were scheduled to broadcast in Germany in 2010.[8][9] In 2010, Mankell was set to work on a screenplay for Sveriges Television about his father-in-law, movie and theatre director Ingmar Bergman, on a series produced in four one-hour episodes. Mankell pitched the project to Sveriges Television and production was planned for 2011.[10]\\nAt the time of his death, Mankell had written over 40 novels that had sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.[11]\\nMankell was married four times and had four sons, Thomas, Marius, Morten and Jon, by different relationships. In 1998 he married Eva Bergman, daughter of film director Ingmar Bergman. They remained married until his death in 2015.[3]\\nIn January 2014, Mankell announced that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer and throat cancer.[12] In May 2014, he reported that treatments had worked well and he was getting better.[13][14]\\nHe wrote a series of articles inspired by his wife Eva, describing his situation, how it felt to be diagnosed,[15] how it felt to be supported,[16] how it felt to wait,[17] and after his first chemotherapy at Sahlgrenska University Hospital about the importance of cancer research.[18] Three weeks before his death he wrote about what happens to people\\'s identity when they are stricken by a serious illness.[19] His last post was published  posthumously 6 October.[20]\\nOn 5\\xa0October 2015, Mankell died at the age of 67, almost two years after having been diagnosed.[21]\\nWe refuse to understand the significance of Islamic culture in Europe\\'s history. We are characterized by intense ignorance. What would Europe have been without Islamic culture? Nothing.\\nHenning Mankell, Dagbladet, 30 August 2007 (talking about his play Lampedusa which tells about a Muslim lesbian immigrant in Sweden)[22]\\nIn his youth Mankell was a left-wing political activist and participated in the Protests of 1968 in Sweden, protesting against, among other things, the Vietnam War, the Portuguese Colonial War, and the apartheid regime in South Africa. Furthermore, he got involved with Folket i Bild/Kulturfront which focused on cultural policy studies.[23] In the 1970s, Mankell moved from Sweden to Norway and lived with a Norwegian woman who was a member of the Maoist Workers\\' Communist Party. He took an active part in their activities but did not join the party.[24]\\nIn 2002, Mankell gave financial support by buying stocks for 50,000 NOK in the Norwegian left-wing newspaper Klassekampen.[25] In 2009, Mankell was a guest at the Palestine Festival of Literature. He said he had seen \"repetition of the despicable apartheid system that once treated Africans and coloured as second-class citizens in their own country\". He found a resemblance between the Israeli West Bank barrier and the Berlin Wall: \"The wall that is currently dividing the country will prevent future attacks, in short term. In the end, it will face the same destiny as the wall that once divided Berlin did.\"[26] Considering the environment the Palestinian people live in, he continued: \"Is it strange that some of them in pure desperation, when they cannot see any other way out, decide to become suicide bombers? Not really? Maybe it is strange that there are not more of them.\"[26]\\nMankell stated in an interview with Haaretz that he did not support Hezbollah.[27] In Mankell\\'s opinion the state of Israel should not have a future as a two-state solution and this \"will not be the end of the historical occupation\". He said he did not encounter antisemitism during his journey, just \"hatred against the occupants that is completely normal and understandable\", and said that \"to keep these two things separate is crucial\".[26]\\nIn 2010, Henning Mankell was on board the MS Sofia, one of the boats which took part in the flotilla which tried to break the Israeli embargo of the Gaza strip.[28] Following the Israel Defense Forces\\' boarding of the flotilla on the morning of 31\\xa0May 2010, Mankell was deported to Sweden. He subsequently called for global sanctions against Israel.[29] In 2010 it was reported that he was considering halting Hebrew translations of his books.[30] In June 2011, Mankell stated in an article in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that he had never considered preventing his books from being translated into Hebrew, and that unidentified persons had stolen his identity to make this false claim.[27]\\nMankell was supposed to be one of twenty Swedish participants in \"Freedom Flotilla II\" which never took place.[31] It was originally scheduled to sail to Gaza in June 2011.[32]\\nThere are too many people in the world who just sit and watch their money pile up, that is very hard for me to understand.\\nHenning Mankell[33]\\nIn 2007, Henning Mankell donated 15 million Swedish crowns (about 1.5 million euros) to SOS Children\\'s Villages for a children\\'s village in Chimoio in western Mozambique.[34] Mankell donated vast amounts of money to charitable organizations such as SOS Children\\'s Villages and Hand in Hand,[35] a collection of independent organizations.[36]\\nIn the 1980s, Mankell visited United Nations refugee camps in Mozambique and later accompanied UN High Commissioner Sadako Ogata to refugee camps in South Africa. In 2013, he visited Congolese refugees in Uganda. He wrote on the plight of refugees and after his death his website asked for donations in his name to the UN Commission on Refugees.[37]\\nThe theme for short stories submitted to the inaugural Festival Fim do Caminho Literary Prize, \"Crime in Mozambique\", was chosen in homage to Mankell.[38][39]\\nKurt Wallander is a fictional police inspector living and working in Ystad,[40] Sweden. In the novels, he solves shocking murders with his colleagues. The novels have an underlying question: \"What went wrong with Swedish society?\"[41]\\nThe series has won many awards, including the German Crime Prize and the British 2001 CWA Gold Dagger for Sidetracked (1995).[42]\\nThe ninth book, The Pyramid (1999), is a prequel about Wallander\\'s past, covering the time until just before the start of Faceless Killers (1991). It includes a collection of five novellas:[42]\\nTen years after The Pyramid, Mankell published another Wallander novel, The Troubled Man (2009), which he said would definitely be the last in the series.[42]\\nLinda is the daughter of Kurt Wallander, who follows in his footsteps as a police officer. Mankell began an intended trilogy of novels with her as the protagonist. However, following the suicide of Johanna Sällström, the actress playing the character at the time in the Swedish TV series, Mankell was so distraught that he decided to abandon the series after only the first novel.[43]\\n',\n",

       " '\\nDame Edith Ngaio Marsh DBE (/ˈnaɪoʊ/;[1] 23 April 1895 – 18 February 1982) was a New Zealand mystery writer and theatre director. She was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1966.[2]\\nAs a crime writer during the \"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\", Marsh is known as one of the \"Queens of Crime\", along with Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Margery Allingham. She is known primarily for her character Inspector Roderick Alleyn, a gentleman detective who works for the Metropolitan Police (London).\\nThe Ngaio Marsh Award is awarded annually for the best New Zealand mystery, crime and thriller fiction writing.[2]\\nMarsh was born in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand, where she also died. In the Introduction to The Collected Short Fiction of Ngaio Marsh, Douglas G. Greene writes:  \"Marsh explained to an interviewer... that in New Zealand European children often receive native names, and Ngaio... can mean either \\'light on the water\\' or \\'little tree bug\\' in the Maori language.  Other sources say that it is the name of a native flowering tree.\"[3] Her father neglected to register her birth until 1900 and there is some uncertainty about the date.[4] She was the only child of Rose and bank clerk Henry Marsh, described by Marsh as \"have-nots\".[5] Her mother\\'s sister Ruth married the geologist, lecturer, and curator Robert Speight.[6] Ngaio Marsh was educated at St Margaret\\'s College in Christchurch, where she was one of the first pupils when the school was founded. She studied painting at the Canterbury College (NZ) School of Art before joining the Allan Wilkie company as an actress in 1916 and touring New Zealand.[2] For a short time in 1921 she was a member of the Rosemary Rees English Comedy Company, a touring company formed by actor-manager Rosemary Rees.[7] In 1928 she went to London with friends (on whom she would base the Lamprey family [Surfeit of Lampreys]).[3]  From then on she divided her time between living in New Zealand and the United Kingdom.[8] In London she began writing syndicated articles, which were published in New Zealand.[3] In addition she and one of the friends with whom she had come to London opened Touch and Go, a handicraft shop that sold items such as decorated trays, bowls and lampshades.[3] From 1928 to 1932 she ran the shop in Knightsbridge, London.[9] During that time she wrote her first book, A Man Lay Dead.  She wrote about the process of writing her first book in an essay, \"Roderick Alleyn\".[10]\\nMarsh was a member of The Group, an art association based in Christchurch, New Zealand. She exhibited with them in 1927, 1928, 1935, 1936, 1938, 1940 and 1947.[11][12]\\nInternationally she is best known for her 32 detective novels published between 1934 and 1982. Along with Dorothy L. Sayers, Margery Allingham and Agatha Christie, she has been classed as one of the four original \"Queens of Crime\" — female writers who dominated the genre of crime fiction in the Golden Age of the 1920s and 1930s.[2]\\nAll her novels feature British CID detective Roderick Alleyn. Several novels feature Marsh\\'s other loves, the theatre and painting. A number are set around theatrical productions (Enter a Murderer, Vintage Murder, Overture to Death, Opening Night, Death at the Dolphin, and Light Thickens), and three others are about actors off stage (Colour Scheme, False Scent and Final Curtain). Her short story \"\\'I Can Find My Way Out\" is also set around a theatrical production and is the earlier \"Jupiter case\" referred to in Opening Night; the short story won third prize in 1946 in the inaugural short story contest of Ellery Queen\\'s Mystery Magazine.[13] Alleyn marries a painter, Agatha Troy, whom he meets during an investigation (Artists in Crime), and who features in three later novels.[2]\\nMost of the novels are set in England, but four are set in New Zealand, with Alleyn either on secondment to the New Zealand police (Colour Scheme and Died in the Wool) or on holiday (Vintage Murder and Photo Finish); Surfeit of Lampreys begins in New Zealand but continues in London.\\nNotably, Colour Scheme includes Māori people among its cast of characters, unusual for novels of the British mystery genre.[14] This novel is said to further subvert the genre by incorporating elements of spy fiction and providing a veiled critique of the British Empire.[14]\\nIn 2018, HarperCollins Publishers released Money in the Morgue by Ngaio Marsh and Stella Duffy.[15] The book was started by Marsh during World War II but abandoned. Working with just the book\\'s title, first three chapters and some notes—but no idea of the plot or motive of the villain—Duffy completed the novel.[16]\\nMarsh\\'s great passion was the theatre.[2] In 1942 she produced a modern-dress Hamlet for the Canterbury University College Drama Society (now University of Canterbury Dramatic Society Incorporated or Dramasoc[17]), the first of many Shakespearean productions with the society until 1969. In 1944, Hamlet and a production of Othello toured a theatre-starved New Zealand to rapturous acclaim. In 1949, assisted by entrepreneur Dan O\\'Connor, her student players toured Australia with a new version of Othello and Pirandello\\'s Six Characters in Search of an Author. In the 1950s she was involved with the New Zealand Players, a relatively short-lived national professional touring repertory company. In 1972 she was invited by the Christchurch City Council to direct Shakespeare\\'s Henry V, the inaugural production for the opening of the newly constructed James Hay Theatre in Christchurch; she made the unusual choice of casting two male leads, who alternated on different nights.\\nShe lived to see New Zealand develop a viable professional theatre industry having realistic Arts Council support, with many of her protégés to the forefront. The 430-seat Ngaio Marsh Theatre at the University of Canterbury is named in her honour.[18]\\nHer home, now known as Ngaio Marsh House, in Cashmere, a suburb of Christchurch, on the northern slopes of the Port Hills is preserved as a museum.[19]\\nMarsh was unofficially engaged to Edward Bristed, who died in action in December 1917.[26] She never married and had no children.[2] She enjoyed close companionships with women, including her lifelong friend Sylvia Fox, but denied being lesbian, according to biographer Joanne Drayton.[5]\\n\"I think Ngaio Marsh wanted the freedom of being who she was in a world, especially in a New Zealand that was still very conformist in its judgments of what constituted \\'decent jokers, good Sheilas, and \\'weirdos\\'\", Roy Vaughan wrote after meeting her on a P&O Liner.[27] In 1965 she published an autobiography, Black Beech and Honeydew. British author and publisher Margaret Lewis wrote an authorized biography, Ngaio Marsh, A Life in 1991. New Zealand art historian Joanne Drayton\\'s biography, Ngaio Marsh: Her Life in Crime was published in 2008. Towards the end of her life she systematically destroyed many of her papers, letters, documents and handwritten manuscripts.[2]\\nMarsh died in Christchurch and was buried at the Church of the Holy Innocents, Mount Peel.[9]\\nAll 33 novels, including one finished after Marsh\\'s death, feature Chief Inspector Alleyn (later Chief Superintendent) of the Criminal Investigation Department, Metropolitan Police (London). The series is chronological: published and probably written in order of the fictional history.[28]  List (with the exception of Money in the Morgue) is from a list in The Collected Short Fiction of Ngaio Marsh ed. Douglas G. Greene (see below under Short Fiction).\\nPosthumously Published:\\nTwo novels were adapted as television episodes in the 1960s; Death in Ecstasy in 1964 with Geoffrey Keen as Alleyn,[34] and Artists in Crime in 1968 with Michael Allinson as Alleyn.[35]\\nFour of the Alleyn novels were adapted for television in New Zealand and aired there in 1977 under the title Ngaio Marsh Theatre, with George Baker as Alleyn.[36] Marsh appears in a cameo in the episode \"Vintage Murder.\"[37]\\nNine were adapted as The Inspector Alleyn Mysteries and aired by the BBC in 1993 and 1994 (the pilot originally in 1990), with Simon Williams (pilot) and then Patrick Malahide as Alleyn.[38]\\nIn the 1990s the BBC made radio adaptations of Surfeit of Lampreys, A Man Lay Dead, Opening Night, and When in Rome starring Jeremy Clyde as Inspector Alleyn, and in 2010 Death and the Dancing Footman featuring Nigel Graham.[39]\\nNgaio Marsh co-wrote the 1951 episode Night at the Vulcan of the Philco Television Playhouse;[40] and appeared as herself in the sixth episode The Central Problem[41] in a television series of the unfinished Charles Dickens mystery novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood.[42]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nSeichō Matsumoto (松本 清張, Matsumoto Seichō, December 21, 1909\\xa0– August 4, 1992; born Kiyoharu Matsumoto) was a Japanese writer, credited with popularizing detective fiction in Japan.\\nMatsumoto\\'s works broke new ground by incorporating elements of human psychology and ordinary life. His works often reflect a wider social context and postwar nihilism that expanded the scope and further darkened the atmosphere of the genre. His exposé of corruption among police officials and criminals was a new addition to the field. The subject of investigation was not just the crime but also the society affected.[citation needed]\\nAlthough Matsumoto was a self-educated prolific author, his first book was not printed until he was in his forties. In the following 40 years, he published more than 450 works. Matsumoto\\'s work included historical novels and non-fiction, but it was his mystery and detective fiction that solidified his reputation as a writer internationally. \\nCredited with popularizing the genre among readers in his country, Matsumoto became Japan\\'s best-selling and highest earning author in the 1960s. His most acclaimed detective novels, including Ten to sen (1958; Points and Lines, 1970); Suna no utsuwa (1961; Inspector Imanishi Investigates, 1989) and Kiri no hata (1961; Pro Bono, 2012), have been translated into a number of languages, including English. He received the Akutagawa Prize in 1952, the Kikuchi Kan Prize in 1970, and the Mystery Writers of Japan Award in 1957. He served as president of the Mystery Writers of Japan from 1963 to 1971.\\nMatsumoto also collaborated with film director Yoshitarō Nomura on adaptations of eight of his novels to film, including Castle of Sand.\\nMatsumoto was born in the city of Kokura, now Kokura Kita ward, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka prefecture, Kyushu, in 1909. His real name was Kiyoharu Matsumoto before he adopted the pen name Seichō Matsumoto; \"Seichō\" is the Sino-Japanese reading of the characters of his given name. He was an only child. After graduating from elementary school, Seichō was hired at a utility company. As an adult he designed layouts for the Asahi Shimbun in Kyushu. His work in the advertising department was interrupted by serving in World War II as a medical corpsman. He spent much of the war in Korea before resuming work at the Asahi Shimbun after the war. He transferred to the Tokyo office in 1950.\\nAlthough Matsumoto attended neither secondary school nor university, he was well-educated. As a rebellious teenager, he read banned revolutionary texts as part of a political protest, which enraged Seichō\\'s father, causing him to destroy his son\\'s collection of literature. Matsumoto sought award-winning works of fiction and studied them. His official foray into literature occurred in 1950 when the magazine Shukan Asahi hosted a fiction contest. He submitted his short story \"Saigō satsu\" (Saigō\\'s Currency) and placed third in the competition. Within six years he had retired from his post at the newspaper to pursue a full-time career as a writer.\\nMatsumoto wrote short fiction while simultaneously producing multiple novels, at one point as many as five concurrently, in the form of magazine serials. Many of his crime stories debuted in periodicals, among them \"Harikomi\" (The Chase), in which a woman reunites with her fugitive lover while police close in on them.\\nFor his literary accomplishments, Matsumoto received the Mystery Writers of Japan Prize, Kikuchi Kan Prize, and the Yoshikawa Eiji Prize for Literature. In 1952 he was awarded the Akutagawa Prize for \"Aru \\'Kokura-nikki\\' den\" (The Legend of the Kokura-Diary).\\nAs a lifelong activist, Matsumoto voiced both anti-American and anti-Japanese sentiments in some of his writings. For example at the height of the 1960 Anpo protests, Matsumoto tapped into the anti-American mood with his notorious work of \"non-fiction\" Black Fog over Japan (日本の黒い霧, Nihon no kuroi kiri), in which an enterprising detective uncovers a vast conspiracy by American secret agents that ties together many famous incidents and unsolved crimes of the postwar period.[1] Likewise, many of Matsumoto\\'s works of fiction and nonfiction revealed various aspects of home-grown corruption in the Japanese system. In 1968 he traveled to communist Cuba as a delegate of the World Cultural Congress and ventured to North Vietnam to meet with its president later that same year.\\nMatsumoto was also interested in archeology and ancient history. He made his ideas public in his fiction and in many essays. His interest extended to Northeast Asia, the Western Regions, and the Celts.\\nIn 1977, Matsumoto met Ellery Queen when they visited Japan. In 1987, he was invited by French mystery writers to talk about his sense of mystery at Grenoble. \\nMatsumoto died from cancer at the age of 82.\\n',\n",
       " 'Evan Hunter, born Salvatore Albert Lombino (October 15, 1926\\xa0– July 6, 2005), was an American author and screenwriter best known for his 87th Precinct novels, written under his Ed McBain pen name, and the novel upon which the film Blackboard Jungle was based.\\nHunter, who legally adopted that name in 1952, also used the pen names John Abbott, Curt Cannon, Hunt Collins, Ezra Hannon, and Richard Marsten, among others. His 87th Precinct novels have become staples of the police procedural genre.\\nSalvatore Lombino was born and raised in New York City. He lived in East Harlem until age 12, when his family moved to the Bronx. He attended Olinville Junior High School (later Richard R. Green Middle School #113), then Evander Childs High School (now Evander Childs Educational Campus), before winning a New York Art Students League scholarship. Later, he was admitted as an art student at Cooper Union. Lombino served in the United States Navy during World War II and wrote several short stories while serving aboard a destroyer in the Pacific. However, none of these stories was published until after he had established himself as an author in the 1950s.\\nAfter the war, Lombino returned to New York and attended Hunter College, where he majored in English and psychology, with minors in dramatics and education, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1950.[2] He published a weekly column in the Hunter College newspaper as \"S.A. Lombino\". In 1981, Lombino was inducted into the Hunter College Hall of Fame, where he was honored for outstanding professional achievement.[3]\\nWhile looking to start a career as a writer, Lombino took a variety of jobs, including 17 days as a teacher at Bronx Vocational High School in September 1950. This experience would later form the basis for his novel The Blackboard Jungle (1954), written under the pen name Evan Hunter, which was adapted into the film Blackboard Jungle (1955).\\nIn 1951, Lombino took a job as an executive editor for the Scott Meredith Literary Agency, working with authors such as Poul Anderson, Arthur C. Clarke, Lester del Rey, Richard S. Prather, and P.G. Wodehouse. He made his first professional short story sale the same year, a science-fiction tale titled \"Welcome, Martians!\", credited to S. A. Lombino.[4]\\nSoon after his initial sale, Lombino sold stories under the pen names Evan Hunter and Hunt Collins. The name Evan Hunter is generally believed to have been derived from two schools he attended, Evander Childs High School and Hunter College, although the author himself would never confirm that. (He did confirm that Hunt Collins was derived from Hunter College.) Lombino legally changed his name to Evan Hunter in May 1952, after an editor told him that a novel he wrote would sell more copies if credited to Evan Hunter than to S. A. Lombino. Thereafter, he used the name Evan Hunter both personally and professionally.\\nAs Evan Hunter, he gained notice with his novel The Blackboard Jungle (1954) dealing with juvenile crime and the New York City public school system. The film adaptation followed in 1955.\\nDuring this era, Hunter also wrote a great deal of genre fiction. He was advised by his agents that publishing too much fiction under the Hunter byline, or publishing any crime fiction as Evan Hunter, might weaken his literary reputation. Consequently, during the 1950s Hunter used the pseudonyms Curt Cannon, Hunt Collins, and Richard Marsten for much of his crime fiction. A prolific author in several genres, Hunter also published approximately two dozen science fiction stories and four science-fiction novels between 1951 and 1956 under the names S. A. Lombino, Evan Hunter, Richard Marsten, D. A. Addams, and Ted Taine.\\nEd McBain, his best known pseudonym, was first used with Cop Hater (1956), the first novel in the 87th Precinct crime series. Hunter revealed that he was McBain in 1958 but continued to use the pseudonym for decades, notably for the 87th Precinct series and the Matthew Hope detective series. He retired the pen names Addams, Cannon, Collins, Marsten, and Taine around 1960. From then on crime novels were generally attributed to McBain and other sorts of fiction to Hunter. Reprints of crime-oriented stories and novels written in the 1950s previously attributed to other pseudonyms were reissued under the McBain byline. Hunter stated that the division of names allowed readers to know what to expect: McBain novels had a consistent writing style, while Hunter novels were more varied.\\nUnder the Hunter name, novels steadily appeared throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s, including Come Winter (1973) and Lizzie (1984). Hunter was also successful as screenwriter for film and television. He wrote the screenplay for the Alfred Hitchcock film The Birds (1963), loosely adapted from Daphne du Maurier\\'s eponymous 1952 novelette. Following The Birds, Hunter was again hired by Hitchcock to complete an in-progress script adapting Winston Graham\\'s novel Marnie. However, Hunter and the director disagreed on how to treat the novel\\'s rape scene, and the writer was sacked.[5] Hunter\\'s other screenplays included Strangers When We Meet (1960), based on his own 1958 novel; and Fuzz (1972), based on his eponymous 1968 87th Precinct novel, which he had written as Ed McBain.\\nAfter having thirteen 87th Precinct novels published from 1956 to 1960, further 87th Precinct novels appeared at a rate of approximately one a year until his death. Additionally, NBC ran a police drama called 87th Precinct during the 1961–62 season, based on McBain\\'s work.\\nFrom 1978 to 1998, McBain published a series about lawyer Matthew Hope; books in this series appeared every year or two, and usually had titles derived from well-known children\\'s stories. For about a decade, from 1984 to 1994, Hunter published no fiction under his own name. In 2000, a novel called Candyland appeared that was credited to both Hunter and McBain. The two-part novel opened in Hunter\\'s psychologically based narrative voice before switching to McBain\\'s customary police procedural style.\\nAside from McBain, Hunter used at least two other pseudonyms for his fiction after 1960: Doors (1975), which was originally attributed to Ezra Hannon before being reissued as a work by McBain, and Scimitar (1992), which was credited to John Abbott.\\nHunter gave advice to other authors in his article \"Dig in and get it done: no-nonsense advice from a prolific author (aka Ed McBain) on starting and finishing your novel\". In it, he advised authors to \"find their voice for it is the most important thing in any novel\".[6]\\nHunter was long rumored to have written an unknown number of pornographic novels, as Dean Hudson, for William Hamling\\'s publishing houses. Hunter adamantly and consistently denied writing any books as Hudson until he died. However, apparently his agent Scott Meredith sold books to Hamling\\'s company as Hunter\\'s work (for attribution as \"Dean Hudson\") and received payments for these books in cash. While notable, it is not definitive proof: Meredith almost certainly forwarded novels to Hamling by any number of authors, claiming these novels were by Hunter simply to make a sale. Ninety-three novels were published under the Hudson name from 1961 to 1969, and even the most avid proponents of the Hunter-as-Hudson theory do not believe Hunter is responsible for all 93.[7][8]\\nHe had three sons: Richard Hunter, an author, speaker, advisor to chief information officers on business value and risk issues, and harmonica player;[citation needed] Mark Hunter, an academic, educator, investigative reporter, and author;[citation needed] and Ted Hunter, a painter, who died in 2006.[9]\\nA heavy smoker for many decades, Hunter had three heart attacks over a number of years (his first in 1987) and needed a heart surgery.[10] A precancerous lesion was found on his larynx in 1992. This was removed however the cancer later returned. In 2005, Hunter died in Weston, Connecticut from laryngeal cancer. He was 78.[11]\\n',\n",

He worked first as a commercial photographer with Tom Sharpe, who later wrote a series of celebrated comic novels, and then as a teacher of English and art at Cowan House in 1959–63, before becoming a crime reporter and photographer for the Natal Witness in his home town of Pietermaritzburg.\\nHis journalistic career saw him headhunted first by the Natal Mercury and then by the Natal Daily News. After the birth of his first son, he moved to Britain with his family in 1965, where he joined the Scottish Daily Mail as a sub-editor. From there, he moved to the Oxford Mail and then to the Oxford Times.\\nHis first crime novel, The Steam Pig, won the CWA Gold Dagger in 1971.\\nHe resigned as deputy editor in 1974 to write full-time. He added to his series of police procedurals based on his experiences in South Africa, featuring the detective partnership of Afrikaner Lieutenant Tromp Kramer and Bantu Detective Sergeant Mickey Zondi.\\nMcClure also wrote a spy novel set in Southern Africa – Rogue Eagle – which won the 1976 CWA Silver Dagger, a number of short stories, and two large non-fiction works that won wide acclaim: Spike Island: Portrait of a Police Division (Liverpool) and Copworld: Inside an American Police Force (San Diego).\\nAfter publishing 14 books, he returned to the bottom rung of \"The Oxford Times\" in 1986, as his police books had made him aware of how much he had missed working with others – his intention being to write in his spare time. What proved his most popular Kramer and Zondi novel then followed, The Song Dog, but journalism soon became all consuming. He became editor in 1994 and three years later The Oxford Times won the Weekly Newspaper of the Year award, beating all comers from across the United Kingdom.\\nHe was promoted to editor of the Oxford Mail in 2000, and spent the next three years on a variety of objectives to enhance the quality and revenue of the county\\'s daily paper. That done, he decided it was time to again step down, and retired to return to writing. He was working on a novel set in Oxford and had just started his own blog when he came down with a respiratory illness and died on 17 June 2006. He lived in Wallingford, Oxfordshire.\\n',\n",

After McDermid reluctantly agreed the woman threw ink at her and ran out of the room.[21] McDermid said the incident would not stop her from doing signings.[22][23]\\nNorthumbria Police arrested Sandra Botham, a 64-year-old woman from the Hendon area of Sunderland, on suspicion of assault.[23][24] Botham was convicted of common assault on 10 July 2013,[25] received a 12-month community order with supervision and was made to pay £50 compensation and a £60 victim surcharge.[26] She was also given a restraining order forbidding her from contacting McDermid for an undefined period of time.[27] The Northern Echo reported that Botham\\'s actions were motivated by McDermid\\'s 1994 non-fiction book A Suitable Job for a Woman, as Botham said the book contained a passage that besmirched her and her family.[28]\\nMcDermid formerly lived in both Stockport and near Alnmouth in Northumberland[29] with three cats[30] and a border terrier dog. Since early 2014 she has lived in Stockport and Edinburgh.[31][32]\\nIn 2016, McDermid captained a team of crime writer challengers on the TV quiz Eggheads, beating the Eggheads and winning £14,000.\\nIn 2010, she was living between Northumberland and Manchester with publisher Kelly Smith,[33] with whom she had entered into a civil partnership in 2006.[2]\\nOn 23 October 2016 McDermid married her partner of two years, Jo Sharp, a professor of geography at the University of Glasgow.[34][35]\\nMcDermid is a radical feminist and socialist.[36][29] She has incorporated feminism into some of her novels.[37]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nJames Stanley McGovern (born September 1949) is an English screenwriter and producer. He is best known for creating the drama series Cracker (1993–1995), for which he received two Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America. He also received recognition for creating drama series such as Hillsborough, The Lakes, The Street, and Accused, among others. On 8 December 2021 Jimmy was conferred the Freedom of Liverpool, in recognition of his life\\'s work.\\nMcGovern was born in Liverpool in September 1949, the son of working-class parents Jane (née Warner) and William McGovern.[1] He was the fifth of nine children. He suffered from a stammer, for which he received no therapy and which affects him still.[2] Brought up a Catholic, he attended St Francis Xavier\\'s College which moved to the Woolton suburb of Liverpool in 1961.\\nIn 1982, McGovern started his TV career working on Channel 4\\'s soap opera Brookside. He tackled many social issues in the course of the series, especially unemployment – which was at a post-war high at the time. In 1993, he created the drama serial Cracker, about the work of a fictional criminal psychologist played by Robbie Coltrane. Made by Granada Television and screened on ITV, the series was a critical and popular success, lasting until 1995. Cracker also aired in the United States, on the Arts and Entertainment cable network. McGovern\\'s writing earned him two Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America. In 1997 he created The Lakes, a drama that shared Brookside\\'s realist setting and reused themes from Cracker, such as gambling addiction. In 2006, he created the BBC One drama, The Street; its third and final series aired in 2009.\\nMcGovern also wrote the script for the television docudrama Hillsborough (1996), based on the events of the stadium disaster in 1989, which claimed the lives of 97 Liverpool fans at an FA Cup semi-final. Among the cast of this drama was Christopher Eccleston, who also featured in Cracker, along with former Brookside actor Ricky Tomlinson. Eccleston later said it was the most important work he\\'d ever done.[3] Newspapers cited Hillsborough as a factor in a new inquiry set up in 1997.[4]\\nIn 2009, McGovern was the executive producer on the BBC One miniseries Moving On.[5] His series Accused aired from 2010 to 2012 on BBC One. It followed a similar format to The Street but with a crime component. The series\\' writers included McGovern, Danny Brocklehurst, Alice Nutter and Shaun Duggan. It was produced by Sita Williams.[citation needed]\\nIn 2012, McGovern and local Indigenous Australian writers from Sydney developed the Australian television drama series Redfern Now, set among the Indigenous Australians of the Sydney suburb of Redfern. The six-part series follows a similar format to Accused, telling the stories of six inner-city households in one street whose lives are changed by a seemingly insignificant incident.[6] The series debuted on 1 November 2012, was produced by Blackfella Films and has been commissioned for a second series.[7]\\nIn June 2021, McGovern\\'s series Time, starring Sean Bean and Stephen Graham, aired on BBC One. The series was directed by Lewis Arnold.[8] It won the BAFTA for best miniseries in 2022.\\nMcGovern wrote the screenplay for the 1994 drama, Priest.[9]\\nMcGovern wrote the book for the musical stage show King Cotton, which explores links between the Atlantic slave trade and industrialisation in North West England, as part of the Liverpool European Capital of Culture 2008. King Cotton premiered at the Lowry in September 2007 before moving to the Liverpool Empire.\\nMcGovern has described cinema scriptwriters as being treated poorly and required to produce an abundance of drafts by successive producers. McGovern has openly criticised dramas such as Footballers\\' Wives lamenting the lack of quality, believable storytelling in the early 2000s.[10] He believes that television directors are underrated. He says: \"I have worked twice with David Blair\" on The Lakes and The Street, \"and I can tell you that he is the best there is. He can make a good project great... Why David hasn’t won the acclaim he deserves is a mystery to me\".[11]\\n',\n",
       " 'Margaret Ellis Millar (née Sturm; February 5, 1915 – March 26, 1994) was an American-Canadian mystery and suspense writer.\\nBorn in Berlin, Ontario, (the city would change its name to Kitchener in 1916), she was educated at the Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate Institute and the University of Toronto.[1] She moved to the United States after marrying Kenneth Millar (better known under the pen name Ross Macdonald).  They resided for decades in the city of Santa Barbara, which was often used as a locale in her later novels under the pseudonyms of San Felice or Santa Felicia. The Millars had a daughter, Linda, who died in 1970.[2][3]\\nMillar\\'s books are distinguished by depth of characterization.  Often we are shown the rather complex interior lives of the people in her books, with issues of class, insecurity, failed ambitions, loneliness or existential isolation or paranoia often being explored.  Unusual people, mild societal misfits or people who don\\'t quite fit into their surroundings are given much interior detail.  In some of the books (for example in The Iron Gates) we are given insight into what it feels like to be losing touch with reality and evolving into madness.  In general, she is a writer of both expressive description and economy, often ambitious in conveying the sociological context of the stories.\\nMillar often delivers \"surprise endings,\" but the details that would allow the solution of the surprise have usually been subtly included, in the best genre tradition. Her books focus on subtleties of human interaction and rich psychological detail of individual characters as much as on plot.\\nMillar was a pioneer in writing about the psychology of women.  Even as early as the \\'40s and \\'50s, her books have a mature and matter-of-fact view of class distinctions, sexual freedom and frustration, and the ambivalence of moral codes depending on a character\\'s economic circumstances. Read against the backdrop of Production Code-era movies of the time, they remind us that life as lived in the \\'40s and \\'50s was not as black-and-white morally as Hollywood would have us believe.\\nIt has been argued that Millar \"essentially created a new hybrid form of literature: detective literature\" in contrast to formulaic genre stories.[4]\\nMany websites cite her as working as a screenwriter for Warner Brothers just after World War II, but no further details are given as to what she may have worked on, even on imdb.com.  Around that time, Warners bought the option on her novel The Iron Gates, with its portrait of a woman descending into madness, but reportedly  Bette Davis and other prominent Warner Brothers actresses ultimately turned it down because the memorable protagonist is missing for the last third of the story.  The film was never produced. In the early \\'60s, two of her novels (Beast in View and Rose\\'s Last Summer, the latter starred Mary Astor) were adapted for the anthology TV series Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Thriller.[5]\\nWhile she was not known for any one recurring detective (unlike her husband, whose constant gumshoe was Lew Archer), she occasionally used a detective character for more than one novel.  Among her occasional ongoing sleuths were Canadians Dr. Paul Prye (her first invention, in the earliest books) and Inspector Sands (a quiet, unassuming Canadian police inspector who might be the most endearing of her recurring inventions).  In the California years, a few books featured either Joe Quinn, a rather down-on-his-luck private eye, or Tom Aragon, a young, Hispanic lawyer.\\nMost of Millar\\'s books are still in print in America.  Starting in 2016, Soho Syndicate has published a large selection of omnibus re-issues grouped by theme.  Many are available as single ebooks.\\nIn 1956, Millar won the Edgar Allan Poe Awards Best Novel award for Beast in View.[3] Two later novels were also nominated for Best Novel.[6] In 1965 she was awarded the Woman of the Year Award by the Los Angeles Times.\\nIn 1983, she was awarded the Grand Master Award by the Mystery Writers of America in recognition of her lifetime achievements.[6]\\n\\nIn 1987, critic and mystery writer H.R.F Keating included Millar\\'s Beast In View in his Crime & Mystery: The 100 Best Books. He wrote:  \"Margaret Millar is surely one of late twentieth-century crime fiction\\'s best writers, in the sense that the actual writing in her books, the prose, is of superb quality. On almost every page of this one there is some description, whether of a physical thing or a mental state, that sends a sharp ray of extra meaning into the reader\\'s mind.\"As evidenced by her birdwatching memoir, birding was an important part of the lives of Margaret Millar and her husband. The couple were founding members of the Santa Barbara Audubon Society.[7] She was a member of the inaugural SBAS Board and Conservation Chair.[8] Millar was an early participant in the American Birding Association\\'s Rare Bird Alert, founded in Santa Barbara in 1963.[9] She also served in the National Audubon Society.[10]\\nTheme issue on Margaret Millar.

       " '\\nGladys Maude Winifred Mitchell (21 April 1901 – 27 July 1983) was an English writer best known for her creation of Mrs Bradley, the heroine of 66 detective novels. She also wrote under the pseudonyms Stephen Hockaby and Malcolm Torrie. Fêted during her life (called \"the Great Gladys\" by Philip Larkin), her work has been largely neglected in the decades since her death.\\nGladys Maude Winifred Mitchell was born in Cowley, Oxford on 19 April 1901 to James, a market gardener of Scottish parentage, and Annie. She was educated at Rothschild School, Brentford and The Green School. From 1919 to 1921 she attended Goldsmiths College and University College London.\\nUpon her graduation, Mitchell became a teacher of history, English and games at St Paul\\'s School, Brentford until 1925. She then taught at St Ann\\'s Senior Girls School, Hanwell until 1939. In 1926 she obtained an external diploma in European History from University College, and she then began to write novels while continuing to teach. In 1941 she joined Brentford School for Girls where she stayed until 1950. After a three-year break from teaching, she took a job at Matthew Arnold School, Staines, where she taught English and history, coached hurdling and wrote the annual school play until her retirement to Corfe Mullen, Dorset in 1961. She continued to write until her death aged 82 on 27 July 1983. Her estate was valued at £48 082.[1]\\nShe was a member of the Middlesex Education Association, the British Olympic Association, the Crime Writers\\' Association, PEN and the Society of Authors. Her hobbies included architecture and writing poetry. She studied the works of Sigmund Freud and her interest in witchcraft was encouraged by her friend the detective novelist Helen Simpson. Mitchell never married.\\nMitchell wrote at least one novel a year throughout her career. Her first novel (Speedy Death, 1929) introduced Beatrice Adela Lestrange Bradley, a polymathic psychoanalyst and author who was featured in a further 65 novels. Her strong views and those of her assistant, Laura Menzies, on social and philosophical issues reflected those of her author; they appear to have been something of a self-portrait of the young Mitchell, reflecting, for good or ill, the standards of the modern, post-war era of the 1920s.\\nMitchell was an early member of the Detection Club along with G. K. Chesterton, Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers and throughout the 1930s was considered to be one of the \"Big Three women detective writers\", but she often challenged and mocked the conventions of the genre – notably in her earliest books, such as the first novel Speedy Death, where there is a particularly surprising twist to the plot, or her parodies of Christie in The Mystery of a Butcher\\'s Shop (1929) and The Saltmarsh Murders (1932). Her plots and settings were unconventional with Freudian psychology, witchcraft (notably in The Devil at Saxon Wall [1935] and The Worsted Viper [1943]) and the supernatural (naiads and Nessie, ghosts and Greek gods) as recurrent themes.\\nIn addition to her 66 Mrs. Bradley novels Mitchell also used the pseudonyms of Stephen Hockaby (for a series of historical novels) and Malcolm Torrie (for a series of detective stories featuring an architect named Timothy Herring) and wrote ten children\\'s books under her own name.\\nAfter her death Mitchell\\'s work was neglected although three posthumously published novels sold well in the 1980s. Radio adaptations were made (by Elizabeth Proud) of Speedy Death (6 October 1990) and The Mystery of a Butcher\\'s Shop (11 & 18 December 1991) both with Mary Wimbush as Mrs Bradley and broadcast on BBC Radio 4; both adaptations were very faithful to the original books. A BBC television series, The Mrs Bradley Mysteries (starring Diana Rigg) was produced in 1999; however, the characteristic cackle and crocodilian looks were absent, and the plots and characters were changed. Several of her books were published in large print editions in the mid 1980s.\\nBy the mid 1990s, only one of her novels was in regular print: a Virago Press paperback edition of The Rising of the Moon (1945) – which is still in print. Something of a renaissance began in 2005 with the publication of a collection of hitherto unpublished short stories, Sleuth\\'s Alchemy, by Crippen & Landru. In the same year Minnow Press published a new edition of her rare 1940 novel Brazen Tongue.[2] Also, Rue Morgue Press published new editions of Death at the Opera (1934) and When Last I Died (1941)[3] – this publisher now has a total of nine Mrs Bradley books in print. Minnow Press continued their Mrs Bradley Collectors\\' Series with the reissue of the scarce 1939 title Printer\\'s Error in 2007, The Worsted Viper in 2009, and Hangman\\'s Curfew in 2010. Of the four Minnow Press titles, only the last two are still in print.[2] More recently, Random House has published nine titles in paperback and as ebooks under their Vintage imprint,[4] Greyladies has published Convent on the Styx (1976) in paperback, and Groaning Spinney (1950) was republished as Murder in the Snow: a Cotswold Christmas Mystery.\\nAlthough critical opinion is divided on what is her best work, her strengths and style can be gleaned from the following 16 books: The Saltmarsh Murders (1932), Death at the Opera (1934), The Devil at Saxon Wall (1935), Come Away, Death (1937), Brazen Tongue (1940), When Last I Died (1941), The Rising of the Moon (1945), Death and the Maiden (1947), The Dancing Druids (1948), Tom Brown\\'s Body (1949), Groaning Spinney (1950), The Echoing Strangers (1952), Merlin\\'s Furlong (1953), Dance to Your Daddy (1969), Nest of Vipers (1979), and The Greenstone Griffins (1983).

She has won numerous Japanese literary awards, including the Yoshikawa Eiji Prize for New Writers, the Yoshikawa Eiji Prize for Literature, the Shiba Ryotaro Prize, the Yamamoto Shūgorō Prize, and the Naoki Prize. Her work has been widely adapted for film, television, manga, and video games, and has been translated into over a dozen languages.\\nMiyabe was born in Tokyo, Japan in 1960.[1] Her mother was a seamstress and her father was an assembly line worker at a factory.[2] She graduated from Sumidagawa High School, then attended a business training school before taking an administrative job at a law office.[3][4]\\nMiyabe started writing novels at the age of 23. In 1984, while working at a law office, Miyabe began to take writing classes at a writing school run by the Kodansha publishing company. She made her literary debut in 1987 with \\'Our Neighbour is a Criminal\\' \"Warera ga rinjin no hanzai\" (我らが隣人の犯罪), which won the 26th All Yomimono Mystery Novel Newcomer Prize and the Japan Mystery Writers Association Prize.[5][6] She has since written dozens of novels and won numerous literary prizes.\\nMiyabe\\'s novel All She Was Worth (火車, Kasha), set at the beginning of Japan\\'s lost decade and telling the story of a Tokyo police inspector\\'s search for a missing woman who might be an identity thief trying to get clear of debt, was published by Futabasha in 1992. The next year Kasha won the Yamamoto Shūgorō Prize, which is awarded for a new literary work that excels at storytelling in any genre.[7][8] Kasha was adapted into a television movie by TV Asahi in 1994, then again in 2011.[9][10] The Japanese version of the book sold millions of copies.[10] An English translation of Kasha, translated by Alfred Birnbaum, was published by Kodansha International under the title All She Was Worth in 1997.[11] Marilyn Stasio of The New York Times positively noted the relationship between the \"spare style and measured pace\" of Birnbaum\\'s translation and the \"somber tone of Miyuki\\'s theme\" of individual value in a consumerist economy,[12] while Cameron Barr of The Christian Science Monitor wrote that the book\\'s treatment of privacy and data tracking would leave the impression that \"personal privacy is a rickety antique.\"[13]\\nThe Reason (理由, Riyū), a multiple perspective murder mystery set in Tokyo\\'s Arakawa ward and written in the form of research interviews conducted in mostly polite language with the suspect, neighbors, and family members of the victims, was published in book form in 1998.[14] Riyū won the 17th Japan Adventure Fiction Association Prize in the Japanese novel category that same year.[15] In 1999 Riyū won the 120th Naoki Prize.[16] Scholar Noriko Chino has described Riyū as \"one of the masterpieces of postwar fictional social criticism.\"[17] Riyū was adapted into a Nobuhiko Obayashi movie that was first shown on the Wowow television channel before its 2004 theatrical release.[18]\\nMiyabe\\'s novel Crossfire (クロスファイア, Kurosufaia), about a police detective pursuing a girl with pyrokinetic powers, was published in the same year as Riyū. It was adapted into the 2000 Toho film Pyrokinesis, starring Akiko Yada and Masami Nagasawa.[19] An English version of Crossfire, translated by Deborah Stuhr Iwabuchi and Anna Husson Isozaki, was published in 2006, with Kirkus Reviews calling it \"the most conventional of her three novels translated into English\".[20] In 2003 Kadokawa Shoten published Miyabe\\'s fantasy novel Brave Story, a story about a boy with a troubled home life who finds a portal to another world. Brave Story became a bestseller in Japan, and has since been adapted into an anime film, a manga series, and a series of video games.[21] The English version of the novel, translated by Alexander O. Smith, won the Mildred L. Batchelder Award in 2008.[22]\\nMiyabe has written novels in several different genres, including science fiction, mystery fiction, historical fiction, social commentary, and young adult literature.  Outside of Japan she is better known for her crime and fantasy novels.[23] English translations of her work include Crossfire (クロスファイア), published in 1998, and Kasha (火車), translated by Alfred Birnbaum as All She Was Worth, published in 1999. Literary scholar Amanda Seaman called Kasha \"a watershed moment in the history of women\\'s detective fiction\" that inspired \"a new wave of women mystery writers.\"[24]\\nA common theme in Miyabe\\'s work is community, particularly the effects of consumerism in Japanese society on family and community relationships.[25]\\n',\n",

His latest appearance is in Jumpers, the 16th novel in the series published in October 2016. Moore\\'s protagonist, Vincent Calvino, half-Jewish and half-Italian, is an ex-lawyer from New York, who, under ambiguous circumstances, gave up law practice and became a private eye in Bangkok. \"Hewn from the hard-boiled Dashiell Hammett/Raymond Chandler model, Calvino is a tough, somewhat tarnished hero with a heart of gold.\"—Mark Schreiber, The Japan Times.[6] Calvino has been said to epitomize \"the complex, thus constantly troubled, private investigator of classic crime fiction, albeit replanted into the exotic, even surreal setting that is Thailand...\"\\n\"Thailand\\'s finest expatriate crime-fiction novelist.\" —Paul Dorsey, The Nation [7]\\nChad A.

Moore is a stylist much like the writers of the early to mid-20th century who kick-started the P.I. genre in America.

       " '\\nWalter Ellis Mosley (born January 12, 1952) is an American novelist, most widely recognized for his crime fiction. He has written a series of best-selling historical mysteries featuring the hard-boiled detective Easy Rawlins, a black private investigator living in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, California; they are perhaps his most popular works. In 2020, Mosley received the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, making him the first Black man to receive the honor.[1]\\nMosley was born in Los Angeles, California. His mother, Ella (née\\xa0Slatkin), was Jewish and worked as a personnel clerk; her ancestors had immigrated from Russia.[2] His father, Leroy Mosley (1924–1993), was an African American from Louisiana who was a supervising custodian at a Los Angeles public school. He had worked as a clerk in the segregated US army during the Second World War. His parents tried to marry in 1951 but, though the union was legal in California, where they were living, no one would give them a marriage license.[3][4][5]\\nMosley was an only child, and ascribes his writing imagination to \"an emptiness in my childhood that I filled up with fantasies\". For $9.50 a week, he attended the Victory Baptist day school, a private African-American elementary school that held pioneering classes in black history. When he was 12, his parents moved from South Central to the more comfortable, working-class west LA.[6] He graduated from Alexander Hamilton High School in 1970.[7] Mosley describes his father as a deep thinker and storyteller, a \"black Socrates\". His mother encouraged him to read European classics from Dickens and Zola to Camus. He also loves Langston Hughes and Gabriel García Márquez. He was largely raised in a non-political family culture, although there were racial conflicts flaring throughout L.A. at the time. He later became more highly politicized and outspoken about racial inequalities in the US, which are a context of much of his fiction.\\nMosley went through a \"long-haired hippie\" phase, drifting around Santa Cruz and Europe. He dropped out of Goddard College, a liberal arts college in Plainfield, Vermont, and then earned a political science degree at Johnson State College. Abandoning a doctorate in political theory, he started work programming computers. He moved to New York in 1981 and met the dancer and choreographer Joy Kellman, whom he married in 1987. They separated 10 years later and were divorced in 2001. While working for Mobil Oil, Mosley took a writing course at City College in Harlem after being inspired by Alice Walker\\'s book The Color Purple.[8] One of his tutors there, Edna O\\'Brien, became a mentor and encouraged him, saying: \"You\\'re Black, Jewish, with a poor upbringing; there are riches therein.\"[9]\\nMosley still resides in New York City.[6]\\nHe says that he identifies as both African-American and Jewish, with strong feelings for both groups.[8]\\nMosley started writing at 34 and claims to have written every day since, penning more than forty books and often publishing two books a year. He has written in a variety of fiction categories, including mystery and afrofuturist science fiction, as well as nonfiction politics. His work has been translated into 21 languages. His direct inspirations include the detective fiction of Dashiell Hammett, Graham Greene and Raymond Chandler. Mosley\\'s fame increased in 1992 when presidential candidate Bill Clinton, a fan of murder mysteries, named Mosley as one of his favorite authors.[6] Mosley made publishing history in 1997 by forgoing an advance to give the manuscript of Gone Fishin\\'  to a small, independent publisher, Black Classic Press in Baltimore, run by former Black Panther Paul Coates.\\nHis first published book, Devil in a Blue Dress, was the basis of a 1995 movie starring Denzel Washington, and the following year a 10-part abridgement of the novel by Margaret Busby, read by Paul Winfield, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4.[10] The world premiere of Mosley\\'s first play, The Fall of Heaven,[11] was staged at the Playhouse in the Park, Cincinnati, Ohio, in January 2010. \\nMosley has served on the board of directors of the National Book Awards. He is on the board of the TransAfrica Forum.[12]\\nFormer literature professor Harold Heft argued for Mosley\\'s inclusion in the literary canon of Jewish-American writers. In Moment magazine, Johanna Neuman writes that black literary circles questioned whether Mosley should be considered a \"black author\". Mosley has said that he prefers to be called a novelist. He explains his desire to write about \"black male heroes\" saying \"hardly anybody in America has written about black male heroes... There are black male protagonists and black male supporting characters, but nobody else writes about black male heroes.\"[8]\\nIn 2019, after working in the writers room for the series Snowfall, Mosley was hired by Alex Kurtzman for a similar role on the third season of Star Trek: Discovery. After working on the series for three weeks, Mosley was notified by CBS of a complaint made against him by another member of the writers room for Mosley\\'s use of the word \"nigger\" while telling a story about his experience with a police officer who had used the slur. CBS told Mosley this was usually a fireable offence, but said no further action would be taken and asked that he not use the word again outside of a script. Mosley chose to leave the series, quitting without informing Kurtzman, and explained his decision in an op-ed for The New York Times in September 2019. He did not identify Discovery as the series he was working on in the op-ed, but this was confirmed in reports on the op-ed shortly after its release.[13]\\n',\n",

The word Ibn-e-Safi is a Persian expression which literally means Son of Safi, where the word Safi means chaste or righteous. He first wrote from the British India of the 1940s, and later Pakistan after the independence of British India in 1947.[1][2]\\nHis main works were the 125-book series Jasoosi Dunya (The Spy World) and the 120-book Imran Series, with a small canon of satirical works and poetry. His novels were characterised by a blend of mystery, adventure, suspense, violence, romance and comedy, achieving massive popularity across a broad readership in South Asia.[3][4]\\nAsrar Ahmad was born on 26 July 1928 in the town \\'Nara\\' of district Allahabad, India. His father\\'s name was Safiullah and mother\\'s name was Naziran Bibi.[2][4][1] His ancestors were Hindus of the Kayashta community, specialised in the fields of education and administration, who converted to Islam many generations ago.[5]\\nHe received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Agra University.[4] In 1948, he started his first job at \\'Nikhat Publications\\' as an editor in the poetry department. His initial works date back to the early 1940s, when he wrote from British India. He also studied at the University of Allahabad where he was class fellow of Professor Mohammad Uzair and one year senior to Mustafa Zaidi [1]. After the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, he began writing novels in the early 1950s while working as a secondary school teacher and continuing part-time studies. After completing the latter, having attracted official attention as being subversive in the independence and post-independence period, he migrated to Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan in August 1952. He started his own company by the name \\'Asrar Publications\\'.[6][3]\\nHe married Umme Salma Khatoon in 1953.[4] In the period from 1960 to 1963, he suffered an episode of severe depression and spent some time in the psychiatry ward of a hospital, but recovered, and returned with a best-selling Imran Series novel, Dairrh Matwaalay (One and a half amused) which was launched in India by to-be Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri.[7][8] In fact, he wrote 36 novels of \\'Jasoosi Duniya\\' and 79 novels of \\'Imran Series\\' after his recovery from depression. In the 1970s, he informally advised the Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan on methods of detection.[4][9]\\nIbne Safi died on 26 July 1980 of pancreatic cancer at age 52. He was buried in Paposhnagar graveyard in Karachi.[4][10]\\nIbn-e-Safi started writing poetry in his childhood and soon earned critical acclaim in whole South-Asian community.  After completing his Bachelor of Arts, he started writing short stories, humour and satire under various names such as \"Siniki (Cynic) Soldier\" and \"Tughral Farghan.\" In the Nakhat magazines, he published several satirical articles which commented on various topics ranging from politics to literature to journalism. His early works in the 1940s included short stories, humour and satire.[4]\\nAccording to one of his autobiographical essays, someone in a literary meeting claimed that Urdu literature had little scope for anything but sexual themes. To challenge this notion, Ibn-e-Safi began writing detective stories in January 1952 in the monthly Nikhat, naming the series Jasoosi Dunya. In 1953, Ibn-e-Safi, along with his mother and sister, moved to Karachi, Pakistan to join his father who had migrated there earlier in 1947.[2][4]\\nIn 1955, Ibn-e-Safi started the Imran Series, which gained as much fame and success as Jasoosi Dunya. Ibne Safi\\'s novels – characterised by a blend of adventure, suspense, violence, romance, and comedy – achieved massive popularity by a broad readership.[3][2]\\nIbne Safi is the best writer of Imran Series and Jasoosi Dunya and creator of both the series.\\nMany a time, Ibne Safi created fictitious settings for his stories. The magical web of his writing is so captivating that these fantasy lands have become real in the minds of readers. Avid fans of the author are experts on the people and cultures of Shakraal, Karaghaal, Maqlaaq, Zeroland, and many other imaginary domains. In cities around India and Pakistan, one can find discothèques, bars, nightclubs, and hotels named after venues found in Ibne Safi\\'s novels. Some places worth mentioning are Dilkusha, Figaro, Niagara, Tip Top, High Circle.[2]\\nBesides humor and satire, he also wrote some short adventures, namely Baldraan Ki Malika (The Queen of Baldraan), Ab Tak Thee Kahaan? (Where had you been?), Shumal Ka Fitna (The Trouble from North), Gultarang, and Moaziz Khopri. In these adventures, Ibne Safi takes the reader to various fictitious, exotic lands of his own imagination.\\nIn 1959, Ibne Safi started writing Aadmi Ki Jarain, a book based on human psychology. However, it remained incomplete due to his illness.\\nIbne Safi wrote the story and screenplay for a film \\'Dhamaka\\' based on his novel \\'Bebakon ki talash\\'. The film did not get the publicity and fame which it deserved and remains mostly forgotten.\\n\"Dhamaka\" was produced by Muhammad Hussain Talpur, based on the Imran Series novel Baibaakon Ki Talaash (Urdu for (In Search of the Outreageous).  Pakistani film actor Javed Sheikh (then known as Javaid Iqbal) was introduced as Zafarul Mulk, the lead role in the film. Muhammad Hussain Talpur (film producer) played the role of Jameson and actress Shabnam played the role of Sabiha. Imran and X-2\\'s team was not shown in the movie. The voice of X-2 was recorded by Ibne Safi himself. Actor Rehman played the role of a villain for the first time. The film featured a rendition of a ghazal by the singer Habib Wali Mohammed, \"Rah-e-talab mein kaun kisi ka\", which was written by Ibn-e-Safi. The movie was released on 13 December 1974.\\nThe Bollywood screenwriter and lyricist Javed Akhtar was greatly inspired by Ibn-e-Safi\\'s Urdu novels, which he grew up reading as a child. Akhtar was particularly influenced by the Jasoosi Dunya and Imran series of detective novels, such as The House of Fear (1955). He was influenced by the fast action, tight plots and economies of expression in the Jasoosi Dunya detective thrillers. He also remembered Ibn-e-Safi\\'s novels for their fascinating characters with catchy memorable names, which left a lasting impression on Akhtar, whose Bollywood scripts later employed some of Ibn-e-Safi\\'s narrative techniques, such as giving catchy names to the characters, his sense of plot, and speaking styles.[11] Akhtar said that Ibn-e-Safi\\'s novels taught him the importance of larger-than-life characters, inspiring famous Bollywood characters such as Gabbar Singh in film Sholay (1975) and Mogambo in Mr. India (1987).[12]\\nThe first English translations of Ibne Safi\\'s mystery novels began appearing in 2010, with The House of Fear from the Imraan Series, translated by Bilal Tanweer and published by Random House India.[13] In 2011, Blaft Publications in association with Tranquebar released four more novels, this time from the Jasoosi Duniya series, translated by the highly acclaimed Urdu critic Shamsur Rahman Faruqi.[3][1][10]\\nList of his non-series work\\nNovels\\n(Note: Most of the English translations of Urdu poetry and titles are literal and do not capture the true essence of the language.

He wrote in various genres of Urdu poetry, such as Hamd, Na`at, Manqabat, Marsia, Ghazal, and Nazm.

Hole takes on seemingly unconnected cases, sometimes found to involve serial killers, bank robbers, gangsters, or the establishment, but spends a significant amount of time battling alcoholism and his own personal demons.[10][11]\\nThe Harry Hole novels are multi-layered, violent, and often feature women in peril, as typified by The Snowman.[12] On the return of Harry Hole in The Thirst, Nesbø said: \"I was always coming back to Harry; he is my soul mate. But it is a dark soul, so it is – as always – both a thrill and a chilling, emotionally exhausting experience. But Harry and the story make it worth the sleepless nights.\"[13]\\nA film adaptation of The Snowman, with Tomas Alfredson directing (replacing Martin Scorsese, who executive produced), and starring Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson, and Charlotte Gainsbourg,[14] premiered in October 2017.[15]\\nDoctor Proctor\\'s Fart Powder, originally published in 2007, was Nesbø\\'s first children\\'s book.

She has won many awards for her writing, including the National Book Award,[1] for her novel them (1969), two O.

Berlind \\'52 Professor Emerita in the Humanities with the Program in Creative Writing.[2] Since 2016, she has been a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where she teaches short fiction in the spring semesters.[3]\\nOates was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2016.[4]\\nOates was born in Lockport, New York, the eldest of three children of Carolina (née Bush), a homemaker of Hungarian descent,[5][6] and Frederic James Oates, a tool and die designer.[5] She grew up on her parents\\' farm outside the town.\\nHer brother, Fred Jr., and sister, Lynn Ann, were born in 1943 and 1956, respectively. (Lynn Ann has autism[5] and is institutionalized, and Oates has not seen her since 1971.[7]) Oates grew up in the working-class farming community of Millersport, New York,[8] and characterized hers as \"a happy, close-knit and unextraordinary family for our time, place and economic status\",[5] but her childhood as \"a daily scramble for existence\".[9] Her paternal grandmother, Blanche Woodside, lived with the family and was \"very close\" to Joyce.[8] After Blanche\\'s death, Joyce learned that Blanche\\'s father had killed himself. Oates eventually drew on aspects of her grandmother\\'s life in writing the novel The Gravedigger\\'s Daughter (2007).[8]\\nViolence marred the lives of Oates and her recent ancestors: Oates\\'s mother\\'s biological father was murdered in 1917, which led to Oates mother\\'s informal adoption; and Oates\\'s paternal grandmother survived, at age fourteen, an attempted murder-suicide at the hands of her own father.[10] When she was a child, Oates’s next-door neighbor pled guilty to charges of arson and attempted murder of his family, and was sentenced to a prison term at Attica Correctional Facility.[11]\\nOates attended the same one-room school her mother had attended as a child.[5] She became interested in reading at an early age and remembers Blanche\\'s gift of Lewis Carroll\\'s Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) as \"the great treasure of my childhood, and the most profound literary influence of my life. This was love at first sight!\"[12] In her early teens, she read the work of Charlotte Brontë, Emily Brontë, Fyodor Dostoevsky, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, and Henry David Thoreau, writers whose \"influences remain very deep\".[13]\\nOates began writing at the age of 14, when Blanche gave her a typewriter.[8] Oates later transferred to several bigger, suburban schools[5] and graduated from Williamsville South High School in 1956, where she worked for her high school newspaper.[14] She was the first in her family to complete high school.[5]\\nAs a teen, Oates also received early recognition for her writing by winning a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.[15]\\nOates earned a scholarship to attend Syracuse University, where she joined Phi Mu. She found Syracuse to be \"a very exciting place academically and intellectually\", and trained herself by \"writing novel after novel and always throwing them out when I completed them\".[16] It was at this point that Oates began reading the work of Franz Kafka, D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann, and Flannery O\\'Connor, and she noted, \"these influences are still quite strong, pervasive\".[13] At the age of 19, she won the \"college short story\" contest sponsored by Mademoiselle. Oates was elected to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior[17] and graduated valedictorian from Syracuse University with a B.A. summa cum laude in English in 1960,[18] and received her M.A. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1961. She was a Ph.D. student at Rice University but left to become a full-time writer.[19]\\nEvelyn Shrifte, president of the Vanguard Press, met Oates soon after Oates received her master\\'s degree. \"She was fresh out of school, and I thought she was a genius\", Shrifte said. Vanguard published Oates\\' first book, the short-story collection By the North Gate, in 1963.[20]\\nThe Vanguard Press published Oates\\' first novel, With Shuddering Fall (1964), when she was 26 years old. In 1966, she published \"Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?\", a short story dedicated to Bob Dylan and written after listening to his song \"It\\'s All Over Now, Baby Blue\".[21] The story is loosely based on the serial killer Charles Schmid, also known as \"The Pied Piper of Tucson\".[22] It has been anthologized many times and adapted as a 1985 film, Smooth Talk, which starred Laura Dern. In 2008, Oates said that of all her published work, she is most noted for \"Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?\"[23]\\nAnother early short story, \"In a Region of Ice\" (The Atlantic Monthly, August 1966[24]), features a young, gifted Jewish-American student. It dramatizes his drift into protest against the world of education and the sober, established society of his parents, his depression, and eventually murder-cum-suicide. It was inspired by a real-life incident (as were several of her works) and Oates had been acquainted with the model of her protagonist. She revisited this subject in the title story of her collection Last Days: Stories (1984). \"In the Region of Ice\" won the first of her two O. Henry Awards.[24]\\nHer second novel was A Garden of Earthly Delights (1967), first of the so-called Wonderland Quartet published by Vanguard 1967–71. All were finalists for the annual National Book Award. The third novel in the series, them (1969), won the 1970 National Book Award for Fiction.[1] It is set in Detroit during a time span from the 1930s to the 1960s, most of it in black ghetto neighborhoods, and deals openly with crime, drugs, and racial and class conflicts. Again, some of the key characters and events were based on real people whom Oates had known or heard of during her years in the city. Since then, she has published an average of two books a year. Frequent topics in her work include rural poverty, sexual abuse, class tensions, desire for power, female childhood and adolescence, and occasionally the \"fantastic\".[25] Violence is a constant in her work, even leading Oates to have written an essay in response to the question: \"Why Is Your Writing So Violent?\"[26]\\nIn 1990, she discussed her novel, Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart, which also deals with themes of racial tension, and described \"the experience of writing [it]\" as \"so intense it seemed almost electric\".[27] She is a fan of poet and novelist Sylvia Plath, describing Plath\\'s sole novel The Bell Jar as a \"near perfect work of art\", but though Oates has often been compared to Plath, she disavows Plath\\'s romanticism about suicide, and among her characters, she favors cunning, hardy survivors, both women and men.[citation needed] In the early 1980s, Oates began writing stories in the Gothic and horror genres; in her foray into these genres, Oates said she was \"deeply influenced\" by Kafka and felt \"a writerly kinship\" with James Joyce.[9]\\nIn 1996, Oates published We Were the Mulvaneys, a novel following the disintegration of an American family, which became a best-seller after being selected by Oprah\\'s Book Club in 2001.[23] We Were the Mulvaneys was eventually turned into a TV movie, which was nominated for several awards. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Oates wrote several books, mostly suspense novels, under the pen names Rosamond Smith and Lauren Kelly.[28]\\nSince at least the early 1980s, Oates has been rumored to be a favorite to win the Nobel Prize in Literature by oddsmakers and critics.[29] Her papers, held at Syracuse University, include 17 unpublished short stories and four unpublished or unfinished novellas. Oates has said that most of her early unpublished work was \"cheerfully thrown away\".[30]\\nOne review of Oates\\'s 1970 story collection The Wheel of Love characterized her as an author \"of considerable talent\" but at that time \"far from being a great writer\".[31]\\nOates\\'s 2006 short story \"Landfill\" was criticized because it drew on the death, several months earlier, of John A. Fiocco Jr., a 19-year-old New Jersey college student.[32]\\nIn 1998, Oates received the F. Scott Fitzgerald Award for Achievement in American Literature, which is given annually to recognize outstanding achievement in American literature.[33]\\nOates founded The Ontario Review, a literary magazine, in 1974 in Canada, with Raymond J. Smith, her husband and fellow graduate student, who would eventually become a professor of 18th-century literature.[8] Smith served as editor of this venture, and Oates served as associate editor.[34] The magazine\\'s mission, according to Smith, the editor, was to bridge the literary and artistic culture of the US and Canada: \"We tried to do this by publishing writers and artists from both countries, as well as essays and reviews of an intercultural nature.\"[35] In 1978, Sylvester & Orphanos published A Sentimental Education, a collection of short stories.[36]\\nIn 1980, Oates and Smith founded Ontario Review Books, an independent publishing house. In 2004, Oates described the partnership as \"a marriage of like minds – both my husband and I are so interested in literature and we read the same books; he\\'ll be reading a book and then I\\'ll read it – we trade and we talk about our reading at meal times\\xa0...\".[5]\\nOates taught in Beaumont, Texas, for a year, then moved to Detroit in 1962, where she began teaching at the University of Detroit. Influenced by the Vietnam war, the 1967 Detroit race riots, and a job offer, Oates moved across the river into Canada in 1968 with her husband, to a teaching position at the University of Windsor in Ontario.[5] In 1978, she moved to Princeton, New Jersey, and began teaching at Princeton University.\\nAmong others, Oates influenced Jonathan Safran Foer, who took an introductory writing course with Oates in 1995 as a Princeton undergraduate.[37] Foer recalled later that Oates took an interest in his writing and his \"most important of writerly qualities, energy\",[38] noting that she was \"the first person to ever make me think I should try to write in any sort of serious way. And my life really changed after that.\"[38] Oates served as advisor for Foer\\'s senior thesis, which was an early version of his novel Everything Is Illuminated (published to acclaim in 2002).[37]\\nOates retired from teaching at Princeton in 2014 and was honored at a retirement party in November of that year.[39][40]\\nOates has taught creative short fiction at UC Berkeley since 2016 and offers her course in spring semesters.[41]\\nOates was raised Catholic, but as of 2007 she identified as an atheist.[42] In an interview with Commonweal magazine, Oates stated: \"I think of religion as a kind of psychological manifestation of deep powers, deep imaginative, mysterious powers which are always with us.\"[43]\\nOates self-identifies as a liberal, and supports gun control.[44] She was a vocal critic of former US President Donald Trump and his policies, both in public and on Twitter.[45]\\nOates opposed the shuttering of cultural institutions on Trump\\'s inauguration day as a protest against the President, stating that this \"would only hurt artists. Rather, cultural institutions should be sanctuaries for those repelled by the inauguration.\"[46]\\nIn January 2019, Oates stated that \"Trump is like a figurehead, but I think what really controls everything is just a few really wealthy families or corporations.\"[47]\\nOates is a regular poster on Twitter, with her account given to her by her publisher HarperCollins.[48] She has drawn particular criticism for the purported Islamophobia of some of her tweets. Oates stated in her criticized tweet, \"Where 99.3% of women report having been sexually harassed & rape is epidemic\\xa0– Egypt\\xa0– natural to inquire: what\\'s the predominant religion?\" She later backtracked from that statement.[49][50] Oates was also criticized for responding to a Mississippi school\\'s pulling of To Kill a Mockingbird from its eighth grade curriculum with a tweet claiming that Mississippians do not read.[51]\\nOates defended her statements on Twitter, saying: \"I don\\'t consider that I really said anything that I don\\'t feel and I think that sometimes the crowd is not necessarily correct. You know, Kierkegaard said, \\'The crowd is a lie.\\' The sort of lynch mob mentality among some people on Twitter and they rush after somebody\\xa0– they rush in this direction; they rush over here; they\\'re kind of rushing around the landscape of the news\".[44]\\nOates writes in longhand,[52] working from \"8 till 1 every day, then again for two or three hours in the evening.\"[29] Her prolificacy has become one of her best-known attributes, although often discussed disparagingly.[29] The New York Times wrote in 1989 that Oates\\'s \"name is synonymous with productivity.\"[53] Martyn Bedford wrote in Literary Review that \"perhaps she is a victim of her own productivity.\"[54] In 2004, The Guardian noted that, \"Nearly every review of an Oates book, it seems, begins with a list [of her publication totals]\".[5]\\nIn a journal entry written in the 1970s, Oates sarcastically addressed her critics, writing, \"So many books! so many! Obviously JCO has a full career behind her, if one chooses to look at it that way; many more titles and she might as well... what?... give up all hopes for a \\'reputation\\'? […] but I work hard, and long, and as the hours roll by I seem to create more than I anticipate; more, certainly, than the literary world allows for a \\'serious\\' writer. Yet I have more stories to tell, and more novels […] \".[55] In The New York Review of Books in 2007, Michael Dirda suggested that disparaging criticism of Oates \"derives from reviewer\\'s angst: How does one judge a new book by Oates when one is not familiar with most of the backlist? Where does one start?\"[29]\\nSeveral publications have published lists of what they deem the best Joyce Carol Oates books, designed to help introduce readers to the author\\'s daunting body of work. In a 2003 article entitled \"Joyce Carol Oates for dummies\", The Rocky Mountain News recommended starting with her early short stories and the novels A Garden of Earthly Delights (1967), them (1969), Wonderland (1971), Black Water (1992), and Blonde (2000).[56] In 2006, The Times listed them, On Boxing (in collaboration with photographer John Ranard) (1987), Black Water, and High Lonesome: New & Selected Stories, 1966–2006 (2006) as \"The Pick of Joyce Carol Oates\".[57] In 2007, Entertainment Weekly listed its Oates favorites as Wonderland, Black Water, Blonde, I\\'ll Take You There (2002), and The Falls (2004).[58] In 2003, Oates herself said that she thinks she will be remembered for, and would most want a first-time Oates reader to read, them and Blonde, although she \"could as easily have chosen a number of titles.\"[59]\\nOates\\'s extensive bibliography contains poetry, plays, criticism, short stories, eleven novellas, and sixty novels, including Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart; Black Water; Mudwoman; Carthage; The Man Without a Shadow; and A Book of American Martyrs. She has published several novels under the pseudonyms Rosamond Smith and Lauren Kelly.[60]\\nOates met Raymond J. Smith, a fellow graduate student, at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and they married in 1961.[8] Smith became a professor of 18th-century literature and, later, an editor and publisher.  Oates described the partnership as \"a marriage of like minds...\" and \"a very collaborative and imaginative marriage\".[5]\\nSmith died of complications from pneumonia on February 18, 2008, and the death affected Oates profoundly.[34] In April 2008, Oates wrote to an interviewer, \"Since my husband\\'s unexpected death, I really have very little energy [...] My marriage\\xa0– my love for my husband\\xa0– seems to have come first in my life, rather than my writing. Set beside his death, the future of my writing scarcely interests me at the moment.\"[89][90]\\nAfter six months of near suicidal grieving for Smith,[91] Oates met Charles Gross, a professor in the Psychology Department and Neuroscience Institute at Princeton, at a dinner party at her home. In early 2009, Oates and Gross were married.[92][93] On April 13, 2019, Oates announced via Twitter that Gross had died at the age of 83.[94]\\nAs a diarist, Oates began keeping a detailed journal in 1973, documenting her personal and literary life; it eventually grew to \"more than 4,000 single-spaced typewritten pages\".[95] In 2008, Oates said she had \"moved away from keeping a formal journal\" and instead preserved copies of her e-mails.[89]\\nAs of 1999, Oates remained devoted to running, of which she has written: \"Ideally, the runner who\\'s a writer is running through the land- and cityscapes of her fiction, like a ghost in a real setting.\"[96] While running, Oates mentally envisions scenes in her novels and works out structural problems in already-written drafts; she formulated the germ of her novel You Must Remember This (1987) while running, when she \"glanced up and saw the ruins of a railroad bridge\", which reminded her of \"a mythical upstate New York city in the right place\".[96]\\nOates was a member of the board of trustees of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation from 1997 to 2016.[97] She is an honorary member of the Simpson Literary Project, which annually awards the $50,000 Simpson/Joyce Carol Oates Literary Prize to a mid-career writer. She has served as the Project\\'s artist-in-residence several times.[98]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nKido Okamoto (岡本 綺堂, Okamoto Kidō, October 15, 1872 – March 1, 1939) was a Japanese author. His real name was Keiji Okamoto (岡本 敬二, Okamoto Keiji). His best known work is the Shin Kabuki play Bancho Sarayashiki.\\nKido was born in the district of Shiba Takanawa, a neighbourhood in Minato Ward, Tōkyō\\nKido’s father, Okamoto Keinosuke  (岡本佳之助) (later Kiyoshi - 清), was a samurai who, after the Meiji Restoration left the service of the Tokugawa Shōgunate and went to work for the British Legation as an interpreter. He was good friends with Ichikawa Danjūrō IX (九代目市川團十 - Kudaime Ichikawa Danjūrō), Konakamura Kiyonori (小中村清矩), Kawanobe Mitate   (川辺御楯) and Kurokawa Mayori (黒川真頼) who together formed the Antiquarian Society (Kyūko Kai - 求古会) to promote the modernisation of Kabuki based on the doctrine of the Theatre Reform Movement (Engeki Kairyō Undō - 演劇改良運動). He was also friends with Morita Kan’ya XII (十二代目守田勘弥) the owner-manager (zamoto -座元) of the Shintomiza Theatre, an employee of the British Legation and avid Kabuki fan Thomas Russell Hillier McClatchie, and an Austro-Hungarian diplomat Heinrich von Siebold.\\nWith the relocation of the British Legation to Kōjimachi District in 1873 Kido’s father moved there with his wife and daughter. Kido was born there, at Nigō Hanzaka (二合半坂), Iitachō (飯田町) in Kōjimachi District (麹町区). Later they moved to Motozono-chō (元園町) in Kōjimachi. Kido learnt Tokiwazu (常磐津) from the daughter of a local hairdresser and Nagauta(長唄) by listening to his older sister’s lessons. Early on, when he was too young to go the Kabuki, he was left at home in the care of two maids and would listen to the gossip of his mother and older sister about the performances when they returned home. As he got older he went to the Kabuki with his family when the family would socialise at the Kikuoka (菊岡) tea house (chaya - 茶屋) in the Shintomiza Theatre’s(新富座) enclosure (undōjō -運動場). During his early attendances at the Kabuki he took a dislike to Danjūrō IX after witnessing, according to Kido, his childish behaviour during an incident backstage but later became an ardent fan.\\nHe would listen to foreign ghost stories told to him by his uncle who brought them back from his overseas travels. He was especially enamoured of ‘Windsor Castle’ by William Harrison Ainsworth which he mistook for Hamlet. At the age of 16 he knew William George Aston, the Secretary of the British Legation, whose children he babysat and from whom he was taught about Shakespeare, a process which Kido said taught him some of the techniques of play-writing.  Much to Kido\\'s delight Aston later helped him find the scripts for Kawatake Mokuami\\'s plays \\'Nakamitsu\\', \\'Shisenryō Koban Umenoha \\', and \\'Kagatobi\\' which had been published by the Ginza-based Kabuki Shinpō  (Kabuki News) Company. He learnt Chinese poetry from his father and English from his uncle, and students at the British Legation. He attended and graduated from Tōkyō First Junior High School (Tōkyō Furitsu Daiichi Chūgakkō - 東京府立第一中学校) afterwards attempting to become a playwright but when that failed from 1890 he wrote stage reviews for the newspaper Tōkyō Nichi Nichi Shimbun (東京日日新聞 Tōkyō Nichi Nichi Shinbun, lit.\"Tokyo Daily News\"), now the Mainichi Shimbun when he used the pseudonym Kyokido, which he later changed to Kido. He went to work for Chūō Shimbun spending 24 years as a newspaper reporter, including a period in Manchuria. He bought the contract of and married a Yoshiwara Geisha from the Uwajima feudal domain called Kojima Sakae (小島栄). Success eluded him until in 1911, his popular play \\'The Mask maker\\'s Story\\' (Shuzenji Monogatari - 修善寺物語) premiered at the Meijiza. In 1916 his Shin (new) Kabuki play \\'Story of a Broken Dish at Bancho\\' (Bancho Sarayashiki - 番町皿屋敷) was staged at the Hongōza Theatre (本郷座). Between 1917 and 1937 ‘The Curious Casebook of Inspector Hanshichi’ (Hanshichi Torimonocho - 半七捕物帳) was serialised. His series on the theatre of the Meiji period, a valuable resource, the first half of which was serialised in the Monthly Kabuki Review Magazine in the late 1920s, early 1930s as \\'Stories of the Past\\' (Sugi ni shi Monogatari - 過ぎにし物語), then again as a series in 1935 and finally in full as \\'On the Theatre of the Meiji Period - Under the Lamp\\' (Meiji Gekidan Ranpu no Moto ni te - 明治劇談ランプの下にて) by Iwanami Shoten in 1993.\\nIn 1918 he visited the US and Europe. His home and library in Kōjimachi were destroyed in the Great earthquake of 1923. He was taken in by his disciple Nukata Roppuku(額田六福) from where he moved to Azabu (麻布) in Minato City (Minato ku - 港区). The following year he moved to Hyakuni chō (百人町) a street in north Shinjuku (Shinjuku ku - 新宿区). From 1935 his articles were occasionally published in Sande Mainichi (Every Sunday - サンデー毎日). His last novel was the controversial Tiger (Tora - 虎) published in 1937 about two brothers running a freak show which is in trouble who hit the jackpot when they get a Tiger cub. He continued to publish plays in the “Stage” magazine (“Butai” - 舞台) from 1930 until 1938. In 1939 he died of pneumonia and is buried with his wife in Aoyama cemetery (Aoyama Reien - 青山霊園) in Minami Aoyama\\nAfter his death one of his students and adoptive heir, his son Okamoto Kyōichi (岡本経一) 1909 -2010, founded the Okamoto Kido Journal which printed much of Kido’s work. Kido’s grandson Okamoto Shuichi (岡本修一) is the current President. The Okamoto Kido Literary Prize, The Okamoto Kido Award (Okamoto Kido Juyo - 岡本綺堂授与) was established but was only awarded twice between 1943 and 1944 during the period leading up to the end of the Second World War.\\n',\n",

       " 'Robert Brown Parker (September 17, 1932 – January 18, 2010) was an American writer, primarily of fiction within the mystery/detective genre. His most famous works were the 40 novels written about the fictional private detective Spenser. ABC television network developed the television series Spenser: For Hire based on the character in the mid-1980s; a series of TV movies was also produced based on the character. His works incorporate encyclopedic knowledge of the Boston metropolitan area.[2] The Spenser novels have been cited as reviving and changing the detective genre by critics and bestselling authors [3] including Robert Crais, Harlan Coben, and Dennis Lehane.[4]\\nParker also wrote nine novels featuring the fictional character Jesse Stone, a Los Angeles police officer who moves to a small New England town; six novels with the fictional character Sunny Randall, a female private investigator; and four Westerns starring the duo Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch. The first was Appaloosa, made into a film starring Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen.\\nParker was born in Springfield, Massachusetts.[5] In 1956, Parker married Joan H. Parker, whom he claimed to have met as a toddler at a birthday party.[6] They spent their childhoods in the same neighborhood.[7]\\nAfter earning a BA degree from Colby College in Waterville, Maine, Parker served as a soldier in the US Army Infantry in Korea. In 1957, he earned his master\\'s degree in English literature from Boston University and then worked in advertising and technical writing until 1962.[5] Parker received a PhD in English literature from Boston University in 1971.[8] His dissertation, titled \"The Violent Hero, Wilderness Heritage, and Urban Reality,\" discussed the exploits of fictional private-eye heroes created by Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Ross Macdonald.[5]\\nParker wrote his first novel[8] in 1971 while teaching at Northeastern University. He became a full professor in 1976, and turned to full-time writing in 1979, with five Spenser novels to his credit.[5]\\nParker\\'s popular Spenser novels are known for his characters of varied races and religions. According to critic Christina Nunez, Parker\\'s \"inclusion of [characters of] other races and sexual persuasions\" lends his writings a \"more modern feel\".[9]  For example, the Spenser series characters include Hawk and Chollo, African-American and Mexican-American, respectively, as well as Spenser\\'s Jewish girlfriend, Susan, various Russians, Ukrainians, Chinese, a gay cop, Lee Farrell, and even a gay mob boss, Gino Fish.[10] The homosexuality of both his sons gave his writing \"[a] sensibility,\" Ms. Nunez feels, \"[which] strengthens Parker\\'s sensibility [toward gays].\" In 1985, Spenser was made into a successful television series, Spenser for Hire which starred Robert Urich, Avery Brooks and Barbara Stock.\\nIn 1994, Parker collaborated with Japanese photographer Kasho Kumagai on a coffee table book called Spenser\\'s Boston, exploring the city through Spenser\\'s \"eyes\" via high quality, 4-color photos. In addition to Parker\\'s introduction, excerpts from several of the Spenser novels were included.[11]\\nParker created female detective Sunny Randall at the request of actress Helen Hunt, who wanted him to write a part for her to play. He wrote the first book, and the film version was planned for 2000[5] but never materialized.[8]  However, his publisher liked the character and asked him to continue with the series.[8]\\nAnother figure created by Parker was Jesse Stone, a troubled former LAPD detective, who starts a new career as a police chief in a small New England town. Between 1997 and 2010, he wrote nine novels featuring Jesse Stone, all of which have been adapted as a series of TV movies by CBS starring Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone.\\nAside from crime writing, Parker also produced several Western novels, including Appaloosa,[12] and children\\'s books. Like Parker\\'s Spenser series, his Westerns have received critical attention. Chris Dacus, who has written on other authors like Cormac McCarthy, has written of the intellectual depth and importance of Parker\\'s Westerns in The Stoic Western Hero: Robert B. Parker\\'s Westerns.[13]\\nParker and his wife created an independent film company called Pearl Productions, based in Boston. It was named after their German short-haired pointer, Pearl.[8]\\nParker and his wife, Joan, had two sons, David and Daniel.  Originally, the character of Spenser was to have been called \"David,\" but Parker didn\\'t want to appear to favor one of his sons over the other.  Parker therefore omitted Spenser\\'s first name entirely, and it was never revealed.\\nParker and his wife separated at one point but then came to an unusual arrangement. They lived in a three-story Victorian house just outside of Harvard Square; she lived on one floor and he on another, and they shared the middle floor. This living arrangement is mirrored in Spenser\\'s private life: his girlfriend, Susan, had an aversion to marriage and living together full-time. Living separately suited them both, although they were fully committed to each other. Explaining the arrangement in an interview on CBS Sunday Morning, Parker said, \"I want to make love to my wife for the rest of my life, but I never want to sleep with her again.\"\\nHe had a great fondness for dogs, including German Shorthair Pointers. Dogs were included in his Spenser stories, aging along with the character and appearing in the ongoing series of novels. The dogs were always named Pearl.[14]\\nParker\\'s favorite books were The Bear, The Great Gatsby, Hamlet, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Maltese Falcon, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, Dubliners, The Big Sleep, U.S.A. trilogy, and The Ambassadors. [15]\\nParker received three nominations and two Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America.  He received the first award, the \"Best Novel Award\" in 1977, for the fourth novel in the Spenser series, Promised Land.[16]  In 1983, he received the Maltese Falcon Award, Japan, for Early Autumn.  In 1990 he shared, with wife Joan, a nomination for \"Best Television Episode\" for the TV series B.L. Stryker; however, the award went to David J. Burke and Alfonse Ruggiero Jr. for Wiseguy.\\nIn 2002, he received the Grand Master Award Edgar for his collective oeuvre.[17]\\nParker received the 2002 Joseph E. Connor Memorial Award from the Phi Alpha Tau Fraternity at Emerson College. He was inducted into the fraternity as an honorary brother in Spring 2003.[18]\\nIn 2008, he was awarded the Gumshoe Lifetime Achievement Award.\\nParker was 77 when he died suddenly of a heart attack at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on January 18, 2010; discovered at his desk by his wife Joan, he had been working on a novel.[1][19][20]\\nJoan Parker, the inspiration for the Susan Silverman character in the Spenser series, died June 12, 2013. \\nLater written by Ace Atkins, the Spenser series continued following Parker\\'s death. The Boston Globe wrote that while some people might have \"viewed the move as unseemly, those people didn\\'t know Robert B. Parker, a man who, when asked how his books would be viewed in 50 years, replied: \\'Don\\'t know, don\\'t care.\\' He was proud of his work, but he mainly saw writing as a means of providing a comfortable life for his family.\"[14]\\nAfter Parker died, his family, together with Parker\\'s publishers, chose to continue the Jesse Stone, Spenser and Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch series. [21]\\nAce Atkins was selected to continue the Spenser novels.  The book Parker was working on at the time of his death was completed by his literary agent Helen Bran. [22]\\nEleven Jesse Stone novels  have been published since Parker\\'s death.  The first three were by Parker\\'s longtime friend and collaborator, Michael Brandman, and the next six by Reed Farrel Coleman. [23][24] Mike Lupica wrote the 10th in 2020 and eleventh in 2021.\\nParker\\'s Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch was continued by actor and screenwriter Robert Knott.[25]\\nThe Sunny Randall series continued with Blood Feud (November 27, 2018) and Grudge Match (May 4, 2020).   The books were written by Parker\\'s friend, sports journalist Mike Lupica.[26]\\n\"Surrogate\"\\' (1991)\" A short story published in the crime anthology New Crimes 3 ISBN\\xa00-88184-737-2\\n',\n",

Among his works are the Alex Cross, Michael Bennett, Women\\'s Murder Club, Maximum Ride, Daniel X, NYPD Red, Witch & Wizard, Private and Middle School series, as well as many stand-alone thrillers, non-fiction, and romance novels. His books have sold more than 425 million copies,[1] and he was the first person to sell 1 million e-books.[2][3] In 2016, Patterson topped Forbes\\'s list of highest-paid authors for the third consecutive year, with an income of $95 million.[4] His total income over a decade is estimated at $700 million.[5]\\nIn November 2015, Patterson received the Literarian Award from the National Book Foundation.[6] Patterson has donated millions of dollars in grants and scholarship to various universities, teachers\\' colleges, independent bookstores, school libraries, and college students to promote literacy.[7]\\nJames Patterson was born on March 22, 1947, in Newburgh, New York, the son of Isabelle (née\\xa0Morris), a homemaker and teacher, and Charles Patterson, an insurance broker.[8][9] The family was working-class and of Irish descent.[10] He graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. in English from Manhattan College and an M.A. in English from Vanderbilt University.[11]\\nPatterson was a PhD candidate at Vanderbilt[12] when he took a job as an advertising executive at J. Walter Thompson.[11] After he retired from advertising in 1996,[13] he devoted his time to writing.[14] His greatest influence, he said later, was probably Evan S. Connell\\'s 1959 debut novel Mrs. Bridge.[12] In 1976, he published his first novel, The Thomas Berryman Number. The novels featuring his character Alex Cross, a forensic psychologist formerly of the Washington DC. Metropolitan Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation who now works as a private psychologist and government consultant, are his most popular and the top-selling U.S. detective series of the 2010s. Patterson has written more than 200 novels since 1976.[15] He has had more than 114 New York Times bestselling novels,[16] and holds The New York Times record for most #1 New York Times bestsellers by a single author – 67 – which is also a Guinness World Record. His novels account for one in 17, roughly 6%, of all hardcover novels sold in the United States; in recent years his novels have sold more copies than those of Stephen King, John Grisham, and Dan Brown combined.[13] His books have sold approximately 305 million copies worldwide.[2] In 2008, he replaced Jacqueline Wilson as the most borrowed author in Britain\\'s libraries.[17] He retained this position at least until 2013.[18] In 2018, he worked with Stephen David Entertainment on the true crime television series James Patterson\\'s Murder Is Forever.\\nPatterson\\'s awards include the Edgar Award, the BCA Mystery Guild\\'s Thriller of the Year, the International Thriller of the Year award,[16] and the Children\\'s Choice Book Award for Author of the Year. He is the first author to have No. 1 new titles simultaneously on The New York Times adult and children\\'s bestsellers lists, and to have two books on NovelTrackr\\'s top-ten list at the same time.[citation needed] In 2019, Patterson was awarded a National Humanities Medal.[19] He appeared on the Fox TV show The Simpsons (in the episode \"Yokel Chords\") and in various episodes of Castle as himself.\\nPatterson works with a variety of co-authors,[20] such as J.D. Barker, Candice Fox, Maxine Paetro, Andrew Gross, Mark Sullivan, Ashwin Sanghi, Michael Ledwidge, and Peter de Jonge.[21] In May 2017, it was announced that Patterson would also co-author a crime fiction book with former U.S. President Bill Clinton.[22] Patterson said the novel, The President Is Missing, would provide a level of detail that only a former U.S. president can offer.[23] Patterson has often said that collaborating with others brings new and interesting ideas to his stories. Of his process, he has said that he is simply more proficient at dreaming up plots than crafting sentence after sentence.[24]\\nIn September 2009, Patterson signed a deal to write or co-write 11 books for adults and 6 for young adults by the end of 2012. Forbes reported the deal was worth at least $150 million, but according to Patterson the estimate was inaccurate.[25]\\nPatterson founded the James Patterson PageTurner Awards in 2005 to donate over $100,000 that year to people, companies, schools, and other institutions that find original and effective ways to spread the excitement of books and reading.[26] The PageTurner Awards were put on hold in 2008 to focus on Patterson\\'s new initiative, ReadKiddoRead.com, which assists parents, teachers, and librarians in finding books for their children. The social networking site for ReadKiddoRead is hosted by Ning. The website is inspired by methods Patterson used with his own son, Jack, who had been a reluctant reader. He has also set up the James Patterson Teacher Education Scholarship in the schools of education at Appalachian State University,[27] Michigan State University,[28] Florida Atlantic University,[29] and the University of Florida.[30] Patterson also runs the College Book Bucks scholarship program. Recently, his JP Entertainment company signed a first-look deal with Entertainment One.[31]\\nIn June 2022, Patterson set off a controversy when he said in an interview that older white males find it difficult to find work in film, theater, television and publishing, and that the problem is \"just another form of racism\". Patterson\\'s publishing house, Hachette, has a workforce that is 65% white and 78% of senior positions are filled by whites. Following publication of data confirming that white males are overrepresented in the publishing field, Patterson apologized on Facebook for his accusations of racism. \"I apologize for saying white male writers having trouble finding work is a form of racism. I absolutely do not believe that racism is practiced against white writers. Please know that I strongly support a diversity of voices being heard—in literature, in Hollywood, everywhere.\"[32]\\nIn March 2023, Patterson signed an exclusive first-look deal with Skydance Television.[33]\\nPatterson has been criticized for co-authoring many of his books[34] and for being more of a brand that focuses on making money than an artist who focuses on his craft.[35]\\nIn an interview for USA Weekend, Stephen King said Patterson was \"a terrible writer but he\\'s very successful.\"[36] King also implied, when asked on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert about how many hours it takes him to write a book, that Patterson needed only 12 hours for two books, noting he and Patterson had \"a mutual respect—sort of\".[37] Patterson said of King in a Wall Street Journal interview, \"He\\'s taken shots at me for years. It\\'s fine, but my approach is to do the opposite with him—to heap praise.\"[38]\\nLegal thriller writer Lisa Scottoline said in a review of Patterson\\'s Kill Alex Cross, \"They used to say that 50 million Elvis Presley fans couldn\\'t be wrong, and James Patterson makes 50 million fans look like a good start. He has sold more than 230 million books, and his fans aren\\'t wrong, either.\"[39]\\nIn 2013, Patterson took out ads titled \"Who Will Save Our Books? Our Bookstores? Our Libraries?\" in Publishers Weekly and The New York Times Book Review, which employed the text \"If there are no bookstores, no libraries, no serious publishers with passionate, dedicated, idealistic editors, what will happen to our literature? Who will discover and mentor new writers? Who will publish our important books? What will happen if there are no more books like these?\"[40] Patterson called the ads an attempt to \"stir the pot a little bit.\"[41] Digital Book World called the ads \"refreshing, really. And brave.\"[42] Maureen Sullivan, president of the American Library Association, told the Tampa Bay Times she was writing Patterson a thank-you letter.[43]\\nIn 2017, digital humanities scholars Simon Fuller and James O\\'Sullivan published research showing that Patterson does not do much actual writing when collaborating with other authors.[44][45] O\\'Sullivan writes: \"Patterson is all about story... \\'author\\', in its widely accepted sense, isn\\'t always the most appropriate term for his role within the writing process.\"[46][47][48] O\\'Sullivan later conducted the same analysis on The President is Missing, a collaboration between Patterson and Bill Clinton; here O\\'Sullivan concludes that Patterson did most of the writing, aside from the end of the novel.[49]\\nIn March 2023, Patterson\\'s Maximum Ride series were banned from two elementary school libraries in Florida\\'s Martin County School District and placed in their middle school libraries.[50] Patterson criticized the move, calling it a \"borderline absurd decision\". He encouraged readers to \"send a polite note\" to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in response to legislation passed to seek community input on school library materials.[51]\\nPatterson, his wife, Susan, and their son live in Lake Worth Beach in Palm Beach County, Florida.[52] In 2015, Patterson established the James Patterson Pledge with Scholastic Book Clubs to put books in the hands of young readers.[53] James and Susan have a son named Jack Patterson born February 8, 1998.\\n',\n",

       " 'Louise Penny (born July 1, 1958)[1] CM OQ is a Canadian author of mystery novels set in the Canadian province of Quebec centred on the work of francophone Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Sûreté du Québec. Penny\\'s first career was as a radio broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). After she turned to writing, she won numerous awards for her work, including the Agatha Award for best mystery novel of the year five times, including four consecutive years (2007–2010), and the Anthony Award for best novel of the year five times, including four consecutive years (2010–2013). Her novels have been published in 23 languages.\\nPenny was born in Toronto, Canada,[2] on July 1, 1958.[1][3] Her mother was an avid reader of both fiction and non-fiction, with a particular liking for crime fiction,[4]\\nand Louise grew up reading mystery writers such as Agatha Christie, Georges Simenon, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Michael Innes.[4]\\nPenny earned a Bachelor of Applied Arts (Radio and Television) from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (now Toronto Metropolitan University) in 1979.[5] After graduation, aged 21, she embarked on an 18-year career as a radio host and journalist with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).[6]\\nPenny left the CBC in 1996 to take up writing.[7] She started a historical novel but had difficulty finishing it, and eventually switched to mystery writing.[7] She entered her first novel, Still Life, in the \"Debut Dagger\" competition in the United Kingdom, placing second out of 800 entries.[7] The novel won other awards, including the \"New Blood\" Dagger award in the United Kingdom, the Arthur Ellis Award in Canada for best first crime novel, the Dilys Award,[8] the Anthony Award and the Barry Award for Best First Novel in the United States.\\nPenny continues to write, garnering major crime novel award nominations for almost every one of her novels and subsequently winning several of those awards.[8]\\nHer work features Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, head of the homicide department of the Sûreté du Québec.[9] The novels are set in the province of Quebec but feature many hallmarks of the British whodunit genre, including murders by unconventional means, bucolic villages, large casts of suspects, red herrings, and a dramatic disclosure of the murderer in the last few pages of the book.[10]\\nIn 2009, Penny helped to launch a new award for aspiring Canadian mystery writers, the Unhanged Arthur for Best Unpublished First Novel.[7]\\nAt the start of her broadcasting career, Penny took postings at locations far from friends and family, and to help deal with feelings of loneliness and isolation, she increasingly turned to alcohol. At the age of 35, she admitted to an alcohol problem and has been sober since.[7] Shortly afterwards, she met her future husband, Michael Whitehead, head of hematology at Montreal Children\\'s Hospital,[11] on a blind date.[7] Michael died on September 18, 2016.[12]\\nPenny currently lives in Knowlton, a small village in Quebec\\'s Eastern Townships about 100\\xa0km from Montreal, Quebec.[2]\\nIn 2013, she was made a Member of the Order of Canada \"for her contributions to Canadian culture as an author shining a spotlight on the Eastern Townships of Quebec\".[13] In 2017 she was made a Member of the Order of Quebec.[14]\\nFor several years, Penny resisted selling the TV or movie rights to her books, afraid of losing creative control of her characters.[15] However, when approached by PDM Entertainment and Attraction Images and offered a position as executive producer during film production, she changed her mind and agreed to sell them the rights to her first two novels.[15] Still Life went into production in the fall of 2012, with British actor Nathaniel Parker cast as Chief Inspector Gamache.[15] The movie aired on CBC TV in 2013.[15] In September 2021, production of Three Pines began in Montreal and rural Quebec, starring Alfred Molina.[16] After airing only one season, the series was cancelled by Prime Video.[17]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nAnne Perry (born Juliet Marion Hulme; 28 October 1938 – 10 April 2023) was a British writer best known as the author of the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt and William Monk series of historical detective fiction.  \\nIn 1994, it became public knowledge that Perry had been convicted for murder as a teenager while living in Christchurch, New Zealand. In 1954, at the age of fifteen, she and her 16-year-old friend Pauline Parker murdered Parker\\'s mother, Honorah Rieper. After serving a five-year sentence for the murder, she changed her name and returned to the United Kingdom. She was identified by journalists following the release of the movie Heavenly Creatures, directed by Peter Jackson, in which Kate Winslet portrays Hulme (Perry).\\nBorn in London, the daughter of physicist Henry Rainsford Hulme, Perry was diagnosed with tuberculosis as a child and sent to the Caribbean, South Africa, and New Zealand in hopes that a warmer climate would improve her health.[1]  She rejoined her family after her father took a position as rector of Canterbury University College in New Zealand. She attended Christchurch Girls\\' High School, located in what became the Cranmer Centre.[2][1] A 1948 Auckland Star photograph of Juliet arriving in New Zealand was discovered by Auckland Libraries staff in 2012 and written about in the Heritage et AL blog.[3]\\nIn June 1954, at the age of 15, Hulme and her best friend Pauline Parker murdered Parker\\'s mother, Honorah Rieper.[4][5] Hulme\\'s parents were in the process of separating and she was supposed to go to South Africa to stay with a relative.[6] The two teenage friends, who had created a complicated fantasy life together populated with celebrities such as Mario Lanza and James Mason, did not want to be separated.[1][7]\\nOn 22 June 1954, the girls and Rieper went for a walk in Victoria Park in the Port Hills of Christchurch. On an isolated path, Hulme dropped an ornamental stone so that Rieper would lean over to retrieve it. Parker had planned to hit her mother with half a brick wrapped in a stocking. The girls presumed that one blow would kill her but it took more than 20.[6]\\nParker and Hulme stood trial in Christchurch in 1954 and were found guilty on 28 August. As they were too young to be considered for the death penalty under New Zealand law at the time, they were convicted and sentenced to be \"detained at Her Majesty\\'s pleasure\". They were released separately five years later.[8] At the time of Hulme\\'s death in 2023, Parker and Hulme were not believed to have had any contact since the trial.[9][10]\\nThe events formed the basis for the 1994 film Heavenly Creatures, in which Melanie Lynskey portrayed a teenage Pauline Parker and Kate Winslet the teenaged Juliet Hulme.  At the time of the film\\'s release, it was not generally known that mystery author Anne Perry was Juliet Hulme; her identity was made public after journalists tracked her down some months after the film\\'s release.[11] Although some presumed Hulme and Parker\\'s relationship to be sexual, Perry stated in 2006 that, while the relationship was obsessive, the two \"were never lesbians\".[10][12]\\nAfter being released from prison in November 1959, Hulme returned to England and became a flight attendant.[13] For a period she lived in the United States, where she joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1968.[14] She later settled in the Scottish village of Portmahomack, where she lived with her mother. Her father had a distinguished scientific career, heading the British hydrogen bomb programme.[15]\\nHulme took the name Anne Perry, using her stepfather\\'s surname.[9] Her first novel, The Cater Street Hangman, was published under this name in 1979.[9] Her works generally fall into one of several categories of genre fiction, including historical murder mysteries and detective fiction. Many feature recurring characters, most importantly Thomas and Charlotte Pitt, who appeared in her first novel, and amnesiac private investigator William Monk, who first appeared in her 1990 novel The Face of a Stranger.\\nAfter Perry\\'s identity as Hulme was revealed in 1994, she said:[12]\\nIt seemed so unfair. Everything I had worked to achieve as a decent member of society was threatened. And once again my life was being interpreted by someone else. It had happened in court when, as a minor, I wasn\\'t allowed to speak and I heard all these lies being told. And now there was a film, but nobody had bothered to talk to me. I knew nothing about it until the day before release. All I could think of was that my life would fall apart and that it might kill my mother.She continued writing and said that she was surprised that her friends stuck by her despite the revelation of her identity and the ensuing media attention.[12] In 1998 she was featured by The Times in its list of 100 \"masters of crime\".[1] Her story \"Heroes\", which first appeared in the 1999 anthology Murder and Obsession, edited by Otto Penzler, won the 2000 Edgar Award for Best Short Story.[1]\\nIn 2005, Perry appeared on the Trisha show to discuss her murder conviction on a special themed show.[16] A 2009 documentary film, Anne Perry Interiors, gave a snapshot of her life and the people close to her.[17] In 2009 she received a lifetime achievement award at the Agatha Awards.[18][19] In 2013 and 2020 she was a guest of honour at the Bouchercon mystery fiction convention.[1] As of 2014[update], Perry had published 29 novels in the Pitt series, 20 novels in the Monk series, ten other novels for adults, three young adult novels and 11 mystery novellas with Christmas themes.[20] Publishers Weekly noted that her sales at that time exceeded 10 million copies and that her works regularly appeared on The New York Times bestseller list.[20]\\nIn 2017, Perry left Scotland and moved to Los Angeles in order to more effectively promote films based on her novels.[21] She had a heart attack in December 2022, and died at a hospital in Los Angeles on 10 April 2023, aged 84.[1][22] Her novel The Fourth Enemy was published the day after her death.[9]\\nEach series is listed in internal chronological order, according to the author\\'s website.[23]\\nPerry\\'s two main series each feature a male and a female protagonist. Thomas Pitt is matched with his wife Charlotte, while William Monk is matched with Hester Latterly, a Crimean War nurse.[24] The Monk mysteries are set earlier in the Victorian era (1850s–1860s) than the Pitt books (1880s–1890s).\\n',\n",
       " '\\nEdith Mary Pargeter OBE BEM (28 September 1913 – 14 October 1995),[1] also known by her pen name Ellis Peters, was an English author of works in many categories, especially history and historical fiction, and was also honoured for her translations of Czech classics. She is probably best known for her murder mysteries, both historical and modern, and especially for her medieval detective series The Cadfael Chronicles.\\nPargeter was born in the village of Horsehay (Shropshire, England), daughter of Edmund Valentine Pargeter (known as Ted) and his wife Edith nee Hordley. Her father was a clerk at the local Horsehay Company ironworks. She later moved with her parents to Dawley where she was educated at Dawley Church of England School and the old Coalbrookdale High School for Girls.[2][3] She had Welsh ancestry, and many of her short stories and books (both fiction and non-fiction) are set in Wales and its borderlands, or have Welsh protagonists.\\nAfter leaving school she worked as a temporary labour exchange clerk, then as an assistant at a chemists\\' shop in Dawley, during which time her first novel, Hortensius, Friend of Nero, was published in 1936.[4][2] During World War II, she enlisted in the Women\\'s Royal Naval Service (the \"Wrens\") in 1940. She worked in an administrative role as a teleprinter operator at Devonport, and then at the Western Approaches Headquarters at Derby House, Liverpool. She reached the rank of petty officer by 1 January 1944 when she was awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) in the New Year Honours.[5][2]\\nIn 1947 Pargeter visited Czechoslovakia in a Workers\\' Educational Association party and became fascinated by the Czech language and culture. She wrote two books about then-Czechoslovakia:  “The Fair Young Phoenix” and “The Coast of Bohemia”.[6] She became fluent in Czech and published award-winning translations of Czech poetry and prose into English.[4][2] She translated books by Jan Neruda, Božena Němcová, and Karel Hynek Mácha, as well as books by 20th-century writers such as  Bohumil Hrabal, Ivan Klíma, Ladislav Vančura, and Nobel Prize Laureate in Literature, the poet Jaroslav Seifert.[6]\\nShe was an active Labour Party supporter until, with her brother Ellis Pargeter (a local councillor in Dawley), she left the party in 1949 because they believed that it had deserted socialist principles.[2]\\nShe devoted the rest of her life to writing, both nonfiction and well-researched fiction. She never attended university but became a self-taught scholar in areas that interested her, especially Shropshire and Wales. Birmingham University gave her an honorary master\\'s degree. She never married, but did fall in love with a Czech man. She remained friends with him after he married another woman.[7] She was pleased that she could support herself with her writing from the time after the Second World War until her death.[7]\\nPargeter wrote under a number of pseudonyms; it was under the name Ellis Peters that she wrote her later crime stories, especially the highly popular series of Brother Cadfael medieval mysteries, featuring a Benedictine monk at the Abbey in Shrewsbury. That pseudonym was drawn from the name of her brother, Ellis, and a version of the name of the daughter of friends, Petra.[7] Many of the novels were made into films for television. Although she won her first award for a novel written in 1963, her greatest fame and sales came with the Cadfael Chronicles, which began in 1977. At the time that the 19th novel was published, sales of the series exceeded 6.5 million.[7] The Cadfael Chronicles drew international attention to Shrewsbury and its history, and greatly increased tourism to the town. In an interview in 1993, she mentioned her own work before the Second World War as a chemist\\'s assistant, where they prepared many of the compounds they sold. \"We used to make bottled medicine that we compounded specially, with ingredients like gentian, rosemary, horehound. You never see that nowadays; those tinctures are never prescribed. They often had bitters of some sort in them, a taste I rather liked. Some of Cadfael’s prescriptions come out of those years.\"[8]\\nHer Cadfael novels show great appreciation for the ideals of medieval Catholic Christianity, but also a recognition of its weaknesses, such as quarrels over the finer points of theology (The Heretic\\'s Apprentice), and the desire of the church to own more and more land and wealth (Monk\\'s Hood, Saint Peter\\'s Fair, The Rose Rent).\\nIn 1992 her mobility began to decline after a fall during a service being televised for Songs of Praise at Shrewsbury Abbey. She had a further fall in 1994 at home that led to the amputation of a leg at Princess Royal Hospital, Telford.[2]\\nShe died at her last home in Glendinning Way, Madeley, Shropshire, in October 1995 at the age of 82, having recently returned home from hospital following a stroke. On 14 September 1997, a new stained glass window depicting St Benedict was installed in Shrewsbury Abbey and was dedicated to the memory of Edith Pargeter, with funds raised by donations from admirers of the author.[9][10][11][2]\\nThe Mystery Writers of America gave Pargeter their Edgar Award in 1963 for Death and the Joyful Woman. In 1980, the British Crime Writers Association awarded her the Silver Dagger for Monk\\'s Hood. In 1993 she won the Cartier Diamond Dagger, an annual award given by the CWA to authors who have made an outstanding lifetime contribution to the field of crime and mystery writing. Pargeter was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) \"for services to Literature\" in the 1994 New Year Honours.[12] To commemorate Pargeter\\'s life and work, in 1999 the CWA established their Ellis Peters Historical Dagger award (later called the Ellis Peters Historical Award) for the best historical crime novel of the year.[13][14]\\nPargeter\\'s Cadfael Chronicles are often credited for popularizing what would later become known as the historical mystery.[15][16]\\nFour novels about Llewelyn the Last:\\n',\n",
       " '\\nEdgar Allan Poe (né\\xa0Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American writer, poet, author, editor, and literary critic who is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism and Gothic fiction in the United States, and of American literature.[1] Poe was one of the country\\'s earliest practitioners of the short story, and is considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre, as well as a significant contributor to the emerging genre of science fiction.[2] He is the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.[3]\\nPoe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Poe.[4] His father abandoned the family in 1810, and when his mother died the following year, Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood. He attended the University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money. He quarreled with John Allan over the funds for his education, and his gambling debts. In 1827, having enlisted in the United States Army under an assumed name, he published his first collection, Tamerlane and Other Poems, credited only to \"a Bostonian\". Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan\\'s wife in 1829. Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declared a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and parted ways with Allan.\\nPoe switched his focus to prose, and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move between several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In 1836, he married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia Clemm, but she died of tuberculosis in 1847. In January 1845, he published his poem \"The Raven\" to instant success. He planned for years to produce his own journal The Penn, later renamed The Stylus. But before it began publishing, Poe died in Baltimore in 1849, aged 40, under mysterious circumstances. The cause of his death remains unknown, and has been variously attributed to many causes including disease, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide.[5]\\nPoe and his works influenced literature around the world, as well as specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography. He and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums. The Mystery Writers of America present an annual Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.\\nEdgar Poe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 19, 1809, the second child of American actor David Poe Jr. and English-born actress Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe. He had an elder brother, Henry, and a younger sister, Rosalie.[6] Their grandfather, David Poe, had emigrated from County Cavan, Ireland, around 1750.[7]\\nHis father abandoned the family in 1810,[8] and his mother died a year later from pulmonary tuberculosis. Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful merchant in Richmond, Virginia, who dealt in a variety of goods, including cloth, wheat, tombstones, tobacco, and slaves.[9] The Allans served as a foster family and gave him the name \"Edgar Allan Poe\",[10] although they never formally adopted him.[11]\\nThe Allan family had Poe baptized into the Episcopal Church in 1812. John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son.[10] The family sailed to the United Kingdom in 1815, and Poe attended the grammar school for a short period in Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland, where Allan was born, before rejoining the family in London in 1816. There he studied at a boarding school in Chelsea until summer 1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransby\\'s Manor House School at Stoke Newington, then a suburb 4 miles (6\\xa0km) north of London.[12]\\nPoe moved with the Allans back to Richmond in 1820. In 1824, he served as the lieutenant of the Richmond youth honor guard as the city celebrated the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette.[13] In March 1825, Allan\\'s uncle and business benefactor William Galt died, who was said to be one of the wealthiest men in Richmond,[14] leaving Allan several acres of real estate. The inheritance was estimated at $750,000 (equivalent to $19,000,000 in 2022).[15] By summer 1825, Allan celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick house called Moldavia.[16]\\nPoe may have become engaged to Sarah Elmira Royster before he registered at the University of Virginia in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages.[17][18] The university was in its infancy, established on the ideals of its founder Thomas Jefferson. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were mostly ignored. Jefferson enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate.[19] During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. He claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe\\'s debts increased.[20] Poe gave up on the university after a year but did not feel welcome returning to Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married another man, Alexander Shelton. He traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer,[21] and started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet during this period.[22]\\nPoe was unable to support himself, so he enlisted in the United States Army as a private on May 27, 1827, using the name \"Edgar A. Perry\". He claimed that he was 22 years old even though he was 18.[23] He first served at Fort Independence in Boston Harbor for five dollars a month.[21] That year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry titled Tamerlane and Other Poems, attributed with the byline \"by a Bostonian\". Only 50 copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention.[24] Poe\\'s regiment was posted to Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South Carolina, and traveled by ship on the brig Waltham on November 8, 1827. Poe was promoted to \"artificer\", an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for artillery, and had his monthly pay doubled.[25] He served for two years and attained the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery, the highest rank that a non-commissioned officer could achieve; he then sought to end his five-year enlistment early. He revealed his real name and his circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Howard, who would allow Poe to be discharged only if he reconciled with Allan. Poe wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic and spent several months ignoring Poe\\'s pleas; Allan may not have written to Poe even to make him aware of his foster mother\\'s illness. Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829, and Poe visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife\\'s death, Allan agreed to support Poe\\'s attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.[26]\\nPoe was finally discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him.[27] Before entering West Point, he moved to Baltimore for a time to stay with his widowed aunt Maria Clemm, her daughter Virginia Eliza Clemm (Poe\\'s first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe.[28] In September of that year, Poe received \"the very first words of encouragement I ever remember to have heard\"[29] in a review of his poetry by influential critic John Neal, prompting Poe to dedicate one of the poems to Neal[30] in his second book Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems, published in Baltimore in 1829.[31]\\nPoe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830.[32] In October 1830, Allan married his second wife Louisa Patterson.[33] The marriage and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of extramarital affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe.[34] Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. He tactically pleaded not guilty to induce dismissal, knowing that he would be found guilty.[35]\\nPoe left for New York in February 1831 and released a third volume of poems, simply titled Poems. The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at West Point, many of whom donated 75 cents to the cause, raising a total of $170. They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones Poe had written about commanding officers.[36] It was printed by Elam Bliss of New York, labeled as \"Second Edition\", and including a page saying, \"To the U.S. Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated\". The book once again reprinted the long poems \"Tamerlane\" and \"Al Aaraaf\" but also six previously unpublished poems, including early versions of \"To Helen\", \"Israfel\", and \"The City in the Sea\".[37] Poe returned to Baltimore to his aunt, brother, and cousin in March 1831. His elder brother Henry had been in ill health, in part due to problems with alcoholism, and he died on August 1, 1831.[38]\\nAfter his brother\\'s death, Poe began more earnest attempts to start his career as a writer, but he chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so.[39] He was one of the first Americans to live by writing alone[3][40] and was hampered by the lack of an international copyright law.[41] American publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans.[40] The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837.[42] There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues.[43] Publishers often refused to pay their writers or paid them much later than they promised,[44] and Poe repeatedly resorted to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.[45]\\nAfter his early attempts at poetry, Poe had turned his attention to prose, likely based on John Neal\\'s critiques in The Yankee magazine.[46] He placed a few stories with a Philadelphia publication and began work on his only drama Politian. The Baltimore Saturday Visiter awarded him a prize in October 1833 for his short story \"MS. Found in a Bottle\".[47] The story brought him to the attention of John P. Kennedy, a Baltimorean of considerable means who helped Poe place some of his stories and introduced him to Thomas W. White, editor of the Southern Literary Messenger in Richmond.\\nIn 1835, Poe became assistant editor of the \\'Southern Literary Messenger,[48] but White discharged him within a few weeks for being drunk on the job.[49] Poe returned to Baltimore, where he obtained a license to marry his cousin Virginia on September 22, 1835, though it is unknown if they were married at that time.[50] He was 26 and she was 13.\\nPoe was reinstated by White after promising good behavior, and he returned to Richmond with Virginia and her mother. He remained at the Messenger until January 1837. During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500.[6] He published several poems, book reviews, critiques, and stories in the paper. On May 16, 1836, he and Virginia held a Presbyterian wedding ceremony performed by Amasa Converse at their Richmond boarding house, with a witness falsely attesting Clemm\\'s age as 21.[50][51]\\nIn 1838, Poe relocated to Philadelphia, where he lived at four different residences between 1838 and 1844, one of which at 532 N. 7th Street has been preserved as a National Historic Landmark.\\nThat same year, Poe\\'s novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket was published and widely reviewed.[52] In the summer of 1839, he became assistant editor of Burton\\'s Gentleman\\'s Magazine. He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing his reputation as a trenchant critic which he had established at the Messenger. Also in 1839, the collection Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque was published in two volumes, though he made little money from it and it received mixed reviews.[53]\\nIn June 1840, Poe published a prospectus announcing his intentions to start his own journal called The Stylus,[54] although he originally intended to call it The Penn, since it would have been based in Philadelphia. He bought advertising space for his prospectus in the June 6, 1840, issue of Philadelphia\\'s Saturday Evening Post: \"Prospectus of the Penn Magazine, a Monthly Literary journal to be edited and published in the city of Philadelphia by Edgar A. Poe.\"[55] The journal was never produced before Poe\\'s death.\\nPoe left Burton\\'s after about a year and found a position as writer and co-editor at Graham\\'s Magazine, a successful monthly publication.[56] In the last number of Graham\\'s for 1841, Poe was among the co-signatories to an editorial note of celebration of the tremendous success the magazine had achieved in the past year: \"Perhaps the editors of no magazine, either in America or in Europe, ever sat down, at the close of a year, to contemplate the progress of their work with more satisfaction than we do now. Our success has been unexampled, almost incredible. We may assert without fear of contradiction that no periodical ever witnessed the same increase during so short a period.\"[57]\\nAround this time, Poe attempted to secure a position in the administration of John Tyler, claiming that he was a member of the Whig Party.[58] He hoped to be appointed to the United States Custom House in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler\\'s son Robert,[59] an acquaintance of Poe\\'s friend Frederick Thomas.[60] Poe failed to show up for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas believed that he had been drunk.[61] Poe was promised an appointment, but all positions were filled by others.[62]\\nOne evening in January 1842, Virginia showed the first signs of consumption, or tuberculosis, while singing and playing the piano, which Poe described as breaking a blood vessel in her throat.[63] She only partially recovered, and Poe began to drink more heavily under the stress of her illness. He left Graham\\'s and attempted to find a new position, for a time angling for a government post. He returned to New York where he worked briefly at the Evening Mirror before becoming editor of the Broadway Journal, and later its owner.[64] There Poe alienated himself from other writers by publicly accusing Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of plagiarism, though Longfellow never responded.[65] On January 29, 1845, Poe\\'s poem \"The Raven\" appeared in the Evening Mirror and became a popular sensation. It made Poe a household name almost instantly,[66] though he was paid only $9 for its publication.[67] It was concurrently published in The American Review: A Whig Journal under the pseudonym \"Quarles\".[68]\\nThe Broadway Journal failed in 1846,[64] and Poe moved to a cottage in Fordham, New York, in the Bronx. That home, now known as the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage, was relocated in later years to a park near the southeast corner of the Grand Concourse and Kingsbridge Road. Nearby, Poe befriended the Jesuits at St. John\\'s College, now Fordham University.[69] Virginia died at the cottage on January 30, 1847.[70] Biographers and critics often suggest that Poe\\'s frequent theme of the \"death of a beautiful woman\" stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his life, including his wife.[71]\\nPoe was increasingly unstable after his wife\\'s death. He attempted to court poet Sarah Helen Whitman, who lived in Providence, Rhode Island. Their engagement failed, purportedly because of Poe\\'s drinking and erratic behavior. There is also strong evidence that Whitman\\'s mother intervened and did much to derail the relationship.[72] Poe then returned to Richmond and resumed a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster.[73]\\nOn October 3, 1849, Poe was found semiconscious in Baltimore, \"in great distress, and... in need of immediate assistance\", according to Joseph W. Walker, who found him.[74] He was taken to the Washington Medical College, where he died on Sunday, October 7, 1849, at 5:00 in the morning.[75] Poe was not coherent long enough to explain how he came to be in his dire condition and why he was wearing clothes that were not his own. He is said to have repeatedly called out the name \"Reynolds\" on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring. His attending physician said that Poe\\'s final words were, \"Lord help my poor soul\".[75] All of the relevant medical records have been lost, including Poe\\'s death certificate.[76]\\nNewspapers at the time reported Poe\\'s death as \"congestion of the brain\" or \"cerebral inflammation\", common euphemisms for death from disreputable causes such as alcoholism.[77] The actual cause of death remains a mystery.[78] Speculation has included delirium tremens, heart disease, epilepsy, syphilis, meningeal inflammation,[5] cholera,[79] carbon monoxide poisoning,[80] and rabies.[81] One theory dating from 1872 suggests that Poe\\'s death resulted from cooping, a form of electoral fraud in which citizens were forced to vote for a particular candidate, sometimes leading to violence and even murder.[82]\\nImmediately after Poe\\'s death, his literary rival Rufus Wilmot Griswold wrote a slanted high-profile obituary under a pseudonym, filled with falsehoods that cast Poe as a lunatic, and which described him as a person who \"walked the streets, in madness or melancholy, with lips moving in indistinct curses, or with eyes upturned in passionate prayers, (never for himself, for he felt, or professed to feel, that he was already damned)\".[83]\\nThe long obituary appeared in the New York Tribune, signed \"Ludwig\" on the day that Poe was buried in Baltimore. It was further published throughout the country. The obituary began, \"Edgar Allan Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore the day before yesterday. This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved by it.\"[84] \"Ludwig\" was soon identified as Griswold, an editor, critic, and anthologist who had borne a grudge against Poe since 1842. Griswold somehow became Poe\\'s literary executor and attempted to destroy his enemy\\'s reputation after his death.[85]\\nGriswold wrote a biographical article of Poe called \"Memoir of the Author\", which he included in an 1850 volume of the collected works. There he depicted Poe as a depraved, drunken, drug-addled madman and included Poe\\'s letters as evidence.[85] Many of his claims were either lies or distortions; for example, it is seriously disputed that Poe was a drug addict.[86] Griswold\\'s book was denounced by those who knew Poe well,[87] including John Neal, who published an article defending Poe and attacking Griswold as a \"Rhadamanthus, who is not to be bilked of his fee, a thimble-full of newspaper notoriety\".[88] Griswold\\'s book nevertheless became a popularly accepted biographical source. This was in part because it was the only full biography available and was widely reprinted, and in part because readers thrilled at the thought of reading works by an \"evil\" man.[89] Letters that Griswold presented as proof were later revealed as forgeries.[90]\\nPoe\\'s best-known fiction works are Gothic horror,[91] adhering to the genre\\'s conventions to appeal to the public taste.[92] His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning.[93] Many of his works are generally considered part of the dark romanticism genre, a literary reaction to transcendentalism[94] which Poe strongly disliked.[95] He referred to followers of the transcendental movement as \"Frog-Pondians\", after the pond on Boston Common,[96][97] and ridiculed their writings as \"metaphor—run mad,\"[98] lapsing into \"obscurity for obscurity\\'s sake\" or \"mysticism for mysticism\\'s sake\".[95] Poe once wrote in a letter to Thomas Holley Chivers that he did not dislike transcendentalists, \"only the pretenders and sophists among them\".[99]\\nBeyond horror, Poe also wrote satires, humor tales, and hoaxes. For comic effect, he used irony and ludicrous extravagance, often in an attempt to liberate the reader from cultural conformity.[92] \"Metzengerstein\" is the first story that Poe is known to have published[100] and his first foray into horror, but it was originally intended as a burlesque satirizing the popular genre.[101] Poe also reinvented science fiction, responding in his writing to emerging technologies such as hot air balloons in \"The Balloon-Hoax\".[102]\\nPoe wrote much of his work using themes aimed specifically at mass-market tastes.[103] To that end, his fiction often included elements of popular pseudosciences, such as phrenology[104] and physiognomy.[105]\\nPoe\\'s writing reflects his literary theories, which he presented in his criticism and also in essays such as \"The Poetic Principle\".[106] He disliked didacticism[107] and allegory,[108] though he believed that meaning in literature should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface. Works with obvious meanings, he wrote, cease to be art.[109] He believed that work of quality should be brief and focus on a specific single effect.[106] To that end, he believed that the writer should carefully calculate every sentiment and idea.[110]\\nPoe describes his method in writing \"The Raven\" in the essay \"The Philosophy of Composition\", and he claims to have strictly followed this method. It has been questioned whether he really followed this system, however. T.\\xa0S. Eliot said: \"It is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method.\"[111] Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as \"a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization\".[112]\\nDuring his lifetime, Poe was mostly recognized as a literary critic. Fellow critic James Russell Lowell called him \"the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America\", suggesting—rhetorically—that he occasionally used prussic acid instead of ink.[113] Poe\\'s caustic reviews earned him the reputation of being a \"tomahawk man\".[114] A favorite target of Poe\\'s criticism was Boston\\'s acclaimed poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was often defended by his literary friends in what was later called \"The Longfellow War\". Poe accused Longfellow of \"the heresy of the didactic\", writing poetry that was preachy, derivative, and thematically plagiarized.[115] Poe correctly predicted that Longfellow\\'s reputation and style of poetry would decline, concluding, \"We grant him high qualities, but deny him the Future\".[116]\\nPoe was also known as a writer of fiction and became one of the first American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States.[117] Poe is particularly respected in France, in part due to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire\\'s translations became definitive renditions of Poe\\'s work in Continental Europe.[118]\\nPoe\\'s early detective fiction tales featuring C. Auguste Dupin laid the groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, \"Each [of Poe\\'s detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\"[119] The Mystery Writers of America have named their awards for excellence in the genre the \"Edgars\".[120] Poe\\'s work also influenced science fiction, notably Jules Verne, who wrote a sequel to Poe\\'s novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket called An Antarctic Mystery, also known as The Sphinx of the Ice Fields.[121] Science fiction author H.\\xa0G. Wells noted, \"Pym tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago\".[122] In 2013, The Guardian cited Pym as one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language, and noted its influence on later authors such as Doyle, Henry James, B. Traven, and David Morrell.[123]\\nHorror author and historian H. P. Lovecraft was heavily influenced by Poe\\'s horror tales, dedicating an entire section of his long essay, \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\", to his influence on the genre.[124] In his letters, Lovecraft described Poe as his \"God of Fiction\".[125] Lovecraft\\'s earlier stories express a significant influence from Poe.[126] A later work, At the Mountains of Madness, quotes him and was influenced by The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket.[127] Lovecraft also made extensive use of Poe\\'s unity of effect in his fiction.[128] Alfred Hitchcock once said, \"It\\'s because I liked Edgar Allan Poe\\'s stories so much that I began to make suspense films\".[129] Many references to Poe\\'s works are present in Vladimir Nabokov\\'s novels.[130]\\nLike many famous artists, Poe\\'s works have spawned imitators.[131] One trend among imitators of Poe has been claims by clairvoyants or psychics to be \"channeling\" poems from Poe\\'s spirit. One of the most notable of these was Lizzie Doten, who published Poems from the Inner Life in 1863, in which she claimed to have \"received\" new compositions by Poe\\'s spirit. The compositions were re-workings of famous Poe poems such as \"The Bells\", but which reflected a new, positive outlook.[132]\\nPoe has also received criticism. This is partly because of the negative perception of his personal character and its influence upon his reputation.[117] William Butler Yeats was occasionally critical of Poe and once called him \"vulgar\".[133] Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson reacted to \"The Raven\" by saying, \"I see nothing in it\",[134] and derisively referred to Poe as \"the jingle man\".[135] Aldous Huxley wrote that Poe\\'s writing \"falls into vulgarity\" by being \"too poetical\"—the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger.[136]\\nIt is believed that only twelve copies have survived of Poe\\'s first book Tamerlane and Other Poems. In December 2009, one copy sold at Christie\\'s auctioneers in New York City for $662,500, a record price paid for a work of American literature.[137]\\nEureka: A Prose Poem, an essay written in 1848, included a cosmological theory that presaged the Big Bang theory by 80 years,[138][139] as well as the first plausible solution to Olbers\\' paradox.[140][141]\\nPoe eschewed the scientific method in Eureka and instead wrote from pure intuition.[142] For this reason, he considered it a work of art, not science,[142] but insisted that it was still true[143] and considered it to be his career masterpiece.[144] Even so, Eureka is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe\\'s suggestions ignored Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets.[145]\\nPoe had a keen interest in cryptography. He had placed a notice of his abilities in the Philadelphia paper Alexander\\'s Weekly (Express) Messenger, inviting submissions of ciphers which he proceeded to solve.[146] In July 1841, Poe had published an essay called \"A Few Words on Secret Writing\" in Graham\\'s Magazine. Capitalizing on public interest in the topic, he wrote \"The Gold-Bug\" incorporating ciphers as an essential part of the story.[147] Poe\\'s success with cryptography relied not so much on his deep knowledge of that field (his method was limited to the simple substitution cryptogram) as on his knowledge of the magazine and newspaper culture. His keen analytical abilities, which were so evident in his detective stories, allowed him to see that the general public was largely ignorant of the methods by which a simple substitution cryptogram can be solved, and he used this to his advantage.[146] The sensation that Poe created with his cryptography stunts played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines.[148]\\nTwo ciphers he published in 1841 under the name \"W.\\xa0B. Tyler\" were not solved until 1992 and 2000 respectively. One was a quote from Joseph Addison\\'s play Cato; the other is probably based on a poem by Hester Thrale.[149][150]\\nPoe had an influence on cryptography beyond increasing public interest during his lifetime. William Friedman, America\\'s foremost cryptologist, was heavily influenced by Poe.[151] Friedman\\'s initial interest in cryptography came from reading \"The Gold-Bug\" as a child, an interest that he later put to use in deciphering Japan\\'s PURPLE code during World War\\xa0II.[152]\\nThe historical Edgar Allan Poe has appeared as a fictionalized character, often in order to represent the \"mad genius\" or \"tormented artist\" and in order to exploit his personal struggles.[153] Many such depictions also blend in with characters from his stories, suggesting that Poe and his characters share identities.[154] Often, fictional depictions of Poe use his mystery-solving skills in such novels as The Poe Shadow by Matthew Pearl.[155]\\n\\nNo childhood home of Poe is still standing, including the Allan family\\'s Moldavia estate. The oldest standing home in Richmond, the Old Stone House, is in use as the Edgar Allan Poe Museum, though Poe never lived there. The collection includes many items that Poe used during his time with the Allan family, and also features several rare first printings of Poe works. 13 West Range is the dorm room that Poe is believed to have used while studying at the University of Virginia in 1826; it is preserved and available for visits. Its upkeep is overseen by a group of students and staff known as the Raven Society.[156]\\nThe earliest surviving home in which Poe lived is at 203 North Amity St. in Baltimore, which is preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum. Poe is believed to have lived in the home at the age of 23 when he first lived with Maria Clemm and Virginia and possibly his grandmother and possibly his brother William Henry Leonard Poe.[157] It is open to the public and is also the home of the Edgar Allan Poe Society.\\nWhile in Philadelphia between 1838 and 1844, Poe lived at at least four different residences, including the Indian Queen Hotel at 15 S. 4th Street, at a residence at 16th and Locust Streets, at 2502 Fairmount Street, and then in the Spring Garden section of the city at 532 N. 7th Street, a residence that has been preserved by the National Park Service as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site.[158][159] Poe\\'s final home in Bronx, New York City, is preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage.[70]\\nIn Boston, a commemorative plaque on Boylston Street is several blocks away from the actual location of Poe\\'s birth.[160][161][162][163] The house which was his birthplace at 62 Carver Street no longer exists; also, the street has since been renamed \"Charles Street South\".[164][163] A \"square\" at the intersection of Broadway, Fayette, and Carver Streets had once been named in his honor,[165] but it disappeared when the streets were rearranged. In 2009, the intersection of Charles and Boylston Streets (two blocks north of his birthplace) was designated \"Edgar Allan Poe Square\".[166]\\nIn March 2014, fundraising was completed for construction of a permanent memorial sculpture, known as Poe Returning to Boston, at this location. The winning design by Stefanie Rocknak depicts a life-sized Poe striding against the wind, accompanied by a flying raven; his suitcase lid has fallen open, leaving a \"paper trail\" of literary works embedded in the sidewalk behind him.[167][168][169] The public unveiling on October 5, 2014, was attended by former U.S. poet laureate Robert Pinsky.[170]\\nOther Poe landmarks include a building on the Upper West Side, where Poe temporarily lived when he first moved to New York City. A plaque suggests that Poe wrote \"The Raven\" here. On Sullivan\\'s Island in Charleston County, South Carolina, the setting of Poe\\'s tale \"The Gold-Bug\" and where Poe served in the Army in 1827 at Fort Moultrie, there is a restaurant called Poe\\'s Tavern. In the Fell\\'s Point section of Baltimore, a bar still stands where legend says that Poe was last seen drinking before his death. Known as \"The Horse You Came in On\", local lore insists that a ghost whom they call \"Edgar\" haunts the rooms above.[171]\\nEarly daguerreotypes of Poe continue to arouse great interest among literary historians.[172] Notable among them are:\\nBetween 1949 and 2009, a bottle of cognac and three roses were left at Poe\\'s original grave marker every January 19 by an unknown visitor affectionately referred to as the \"Poe Toaster\". Sam Porpora was a historian at the Westminster Church in Baltimore, where Poe is buried; he claimed on August 15, 2007, that he had started the tradition in 1949. Porpora said that the tradition began in order to raise money and enhance the profile of the church. His story has not been confirmed,[173] and some details which he gave to the press are factually inaccurate.[174] The Poe Toaster\\'s last appearance was on January 19, 2009, the day of Poe\\'s bicentennial.[175]\\nShort stories\\nPoetry\\nOther works\\n Category\\n',\n",

       " 'Ellery Queen is a pseudonym created in 1928 by the American detective fiction writers Frederic Dannay (1905–1982) and Manfred Bennington Lee (1905–1971). It is also the name of their main fictional detective, a mystery writer in New York City who helps his police inspector father solve baffling murder mysteries.[1][2][3] Dannay and Lee wrote most of the novels and short story collections in which Ellery Queen appears as a character, and these books were among the most popular American mysteries published between 1929 and 1971. Under the pseudonym Ellery Queen, they also edited more than thirty anthologies of crime fiction and true crime. Dannay founded, and for many years edited, the crime fiction magazine Ellery Queen\\'s Mystery Magazine, which has been published continuously from 1941 to the present. From 1961 onwards, Dannay and Lee commissioned other authors to write thrillers using the pseudonym Ellery Queen, but not featuring Ellery Queen as a character; some such novels were juvenile and were credited to Ellery Queen Jr.  They also wrote four mysteries under the pseudonym Barnaby Ross, which featured the detective Drury Lane.[3][4][5] Several movies, radio shows, and television shows were based on their works.[6]\\nDannay and Lee were cousins, who were better known by their professional names.[2][7]Frederic Dannay was the professional name of Daniel Nathan[8][2] and Manfred Bennington Lee that of Emanuel Benjamin Lepofsky.[2][8][5] Since 2013, the complete works of Ellery Queen have been represented by JABberwocky Literary Agency.[9][10]\\nManfred Bennington Lee was born as Emanuel Benjamin Lepofsky on 11 January 1905 in Brooklyn, New York.[2] He graduated from the New York University with a summa cum laude degree in English in the 1920s.[8] He died on 3 April 1971 in Roxbury, Connecticut.[2][11]\\nFrederic Dannay was born as Daniel Nathan on 20 October 1905 in Brooklyn, New York.[2][12] He married Rose Koppel, an assistant registrar at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, in 1975.[13] He died on 3 September 1982 in White Plains, New York.[2][14]\\nEllery Queen was created in the fall of 1928 when Dannay and Lee entered a mystery novel writing contest offering a prize of $7500 (equivalent to $128,000 in 2022) jointly sponsored by McClure\\'s magazine and Frederick A. Stokes Company. They decided to use as their collective pseudonym the same name they had given to their detective as they believed readers tended to remember the names of detectives but forget those of their creators. They were informed that they had won the contest, but McClure\\'s magazine went bankrupt and was absorbed by The Smart Set magazine before they received any money.[15][16][17][18]\\nThe Smart Set magazine rejudged the contest and awarded the prize to an entry by the writer Isabel Briggs Myers but in 1929, Frederick A. Stokes Company agreed to publish Dannay and Lee\\'s story under the title The Roman Hat Mystery. Buoyed by its success, they were contracted to write more mysteries and they went on to write a successful series of novels and short stories that lasted 42 years.[15][19][20][21]\\nDuring the 1940s, Ellery Queen was probably the most popular American mystery writer.[22][4] More than 150 million copies of Queen\\'s books were sold globally and \\'he\\' remained the best-selling mystery writer in Japan till the end of the 1970s.[23][24]\\nMany short stories were also published under the Queen name, which were mostly well-received. The novelist and critic Julian Symons called them \"as absolutely fair and totally puzzling as the most passionate devotee of orthodoxy could wish\" and said they were \"composed with wonderful skill\"[25] whereas the historian Jaques Barzun said they were \"full of ingenious gimmicks and adorned with excellent titles\".[26]\\nDannay, without much involvement from Lee, founded the crime fiction magazine Ellery Queen\\'s Mystery Magazine in 1941, and served as its editor-in-chief until his death in 1982. However, they together edited numerous collections and anthologies of crime fiction such as The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes and 101 Years\\' Entertainment, The Great Detective Stories, 1841–1941. They were awarded the Grand Master Award by the Mystery Writers of America in 1961 for their work under the Ellery Queen pseudonym.[3][15][27]\\nFrom 1961 onwards, they allowed the \\'Ellery Queen\\' nom de plume to be used as a house name for several novels written by other authors. None of these novels feature Ellery Queen as a character.[15] Three of them star \"the governor\\'s troubleshooter\" Micah \"Mike\" McCall and six of them feature Captain Tim Corrigan of the New York City Police Department. The prominent science-fiction writer Jack Vance wrote three such novels including the 1965 locked room mystery A Room to Die In.[3]\\nDannay and Lee remained reticent about their writing methods.[7][28] Novelist and critic H.R.F. Keating wrote, \"How actually did they do it? Did they sit together and hammer the stuff out word by word? Did one write the dialogue and the other the narration? ... What eventually happened was that Fred Dannay, in principle, produced the plots, the clues, and what would have to be deduced from them as well as the outlines of the characters and Manfred Lee clothed it all in words. But it is unlikely to have been as clear cut as that.\"[29]\\nAccording to the crime fiction critic Otto Penzler, \"As an anthologist, Ellery Queen is without peer, his taste unequalled. As a bibliographer and a collector of the detective short story, Queen is, again, a historical personage. Indeed, Ellery Queen clearly is, after Poe, the most important American in mystery fiction.\"[30]\\nBritish crime novelist Margery Allingham said that Dannay and Lee had \"done far more for the detective story than any other two men put together\" and critic Anthony Berkeley Cox famously quoted \"Ellery Queen is the American Detective Novel\".[31][32]\\nAlthough Dannay outlived Lee by eleven years, the Ellery Queen nom de plume died with Lee. The last novel featuring the character Ellery Queen, A Fine and Private Place, was published in 1971, the year of Lee\\'s death.[33] However, Ellery Queen\\'s Mystery Magazine is still in print as of 2023, now published as six \"double issues\" per year by Dell Magazines.[34]\\nIn 1932 and 1933, Dannay and Lee wrote four novels using the pseudonym Barnaby Ross featuring Drury Lane, a Shakespearean actor who had retired from the stage due to deafness and is now often consulted as an amateur detective. The novels also feature Inspector Thumm (initially as a member of the New York police, later as a private investigator) and his crime-solving daughter Patience. From the 1940s, republications of the Drury Lane books were mostly under the Ellery Queen name.[15]\\nIn the early 1930s, before their identity as the authors behind Ellery Queen and Barnaby Ross had been made public, Dannay and Lee staged a series of public debates with Lee impersonating Queen and Dannay impersonating Ross, both of them wearing masks to preserve their anonymity. According to H.R.F. Keating, \"People said Ross must be the wit and critic Alexander Woollcott and Queen [must be] S.S. Van Dine, creator of the super-snob detective Philo Vance, on whom \\'Ellery Queen\\' was indeed modeled.\"[29]\\nIn the 1960s, Dannay and Lee allowed the Barnaby Ross name to be used as a pseudonym for a series of historical romance novels by the writer Don Tracy.[15][35]\\nThe Queen novels are examples of \"fair play\" mysteries, a subgenre of the whodunit mystery in which the reader obtains the clues along with the detective and the mysteries are presented as intellectually challenging puzzles. These type of novels comprised what would later be known as the Golden age of detective fiction (Usually dated from 1920 to 1940 but some critics include the 1940s and even the 1950s).[33] Mystery writer John Dickson Carr called this subgenre \"the grandest game in the world\".[36]\\nThe first Ellery Queen book The Roman Hat Mystery established a reliable template: a geographic formula title (The Dutch Shoe Mystery, The Egyptian Cross Mystery, etc.); an unusual crime; a complex series of clues and red herrings; multiple misdirected solutions before the final correct solution is revealed, and a cast of supporting characters including Ellery Queen, the detective, Queen\\'s father Inspector Richard Queen and his irascible assistant Sergeant Thomas Velie. What became the best known part of the early Ellery Queen books was the \"Challenge to the Reader\", a single page near the end of the book, on which Queen, the detective, paused the narrative, directly addressed the reader, declared that they had now seen all the clues needed to solve the mystery, and only one solution was possible. According to Julian Symons, \"The rare distinction of the books is that this claim is accurate. These are problems in deduction that do really permit of only one answer, and there are few crime stories indeed of which this can be said... Judged as exercises in rational deduction, these are certainly among the best detective stories ever written.\"[37]\\nIn many earlier books like The Greek Coffin Mystery and The Siamese Twin Mystery, multiple solutions to the mystery are proposed, a feature that also showed up in later books such as Double, Double and Ten Days\\' Wonder. Queen\\'s \"false solution, followed by the true\" became a hallmark of the canon. Another stylistic element in many early books (notably The Dutch Shoe Mystery, The French Powder Mystery and Halfway House) is Queen\\'s method of creating a list of attributes (the murderer is male, the murderer smokes a pipe, etc.) and comparing each suspect to these attributes, thereby reducing the list of suspects to a single name, often an unlikely one.[38][4]\\nBy the late 1930s, when Ellery Queen, the fictional character, had moved to Hollywood to try movie scriptwriting, the tone of the novels changed along with the detective\\'s character. Romance was introduced, solutions began to involve more psychological elements, and the \"Challenge to the Reader\" vanished. The novels also shifted from mere puzzles to more introspective themes. The three novels set in the fictional New England town of Wrightsville even showed the limitations of Queen\\'s methods of detection. Julian Symons said \"Ellery... occasionally lost his father, as his exploits took place more frequently in the small town of Wrightsville... where his arrival as a house guest was likely to be the signal for the commission of one or more murders. Very intelligently, Dannay and Lee used this change in locale to loosen the structure of their stories. More emphasis was placed on personal relationships and less on the details of investigation.\"[39]\\nIn the 1950s and the 1960s, Dannay and Lee became more experimental, especially in the novels they wrote with other writers. The Player on the Other Side (1963), ghost-written with Theodore Sturgeon, delves more deeply into motive than most Queen novels. And on the Eighth Day (1964), ghost-written with Avram Davidson, is a religious allegory about fascism.[33]\\nEllery Queen, the fictional character, is the hero of more than thirty novels and several short story collections, written by Dannay and Lee and published under the Ellery Queen pseudonym. He is probably inspired by Philo Vance, the detective created by the writer S.S. Van Dine.[15] According to the critic H.R.F. Keating, \"Later the cousins [Dannay and Lee] took a sharper view of Vance, Manfred Lee calling him, with typical vehemence, \\'the biggest prig that ever came down the pike\\'.\"[29]\\nAs Van Dine had done earlier with Philo Vance, Dannay and Lee gave Ellery Queen an extremely elaborate back story that was rarely mentioned after the first few novels. In fact, Queen goes through several transformations in his personality and his approach to investigation over the course of the series.[1][3]\\nIn the earlier novels, he is a snobbish Harvard-educated intellectual of independent means who wears pince-nez glasses and investigates crimes because he finds them stimulating. He supposedly derives these characteristics from his unnamed late mother, the daughter of an aristocratic New York family, who had married Richard Queen, a bluff and short policeman.[4]\\nBeginning in the 1938 novel The Four of Hearts, he spends some time working in Hollywood as a screenwriter. Soon, he has a slick façade, is part of Hollywood society and hobnobs comfortably with the wealthy and the famous. Beginning with Calamity Town in 1942, he becomes less of a cypher and more of a human being, often becoming emotionally affected by the people in his cases, and at one point quitting detective work altogether. Calamity Town and some other novels during this period are set in the imaginary town of Wrightsville, where subsidiary characters recur from story to story as Queen relates to the various strata of American society as an outsider.[4]\\nHowever, after his Hollywood and Wrightsville periods, he returns to his New York City roots for the rest of his career, and is then seen again as an ultra-logical crime solver who remains distant from his cases. In the very late novels, he often seems a near-faceless, near-characterless persona whose role is purely to solve the mystery. So striking are the differences between the different periods of the Ellery Queen character that Julian Symons advanced the theory that there were two Ellery Queens — an older and younger brother.[40]\\nQueen is said to be married and the father of a child in the introductions of the first few novels, but this plot line is never developed and he is portrayed as a bachelor in all of his later appearances. Nikki Porter, who acts as Queen\\'s secretary and is something of a love interest, is first introduced in the radio series The Adventures of Ellery Queen in 1939. Her first appearance in a written story is on the final pages of the 1943 novel There Was an Old Woman, when a character with whom Queen has had some flirtatious moments suddenly announces that she will change her name to Nikki Porter and will work as Queen\\'s secretary. Nikki Porter appears sporadically thereafter in the novels and short stories, linking the character from radio and movies to the written canon.[3]\\nPaula Paris, an agoraphobic gossip columnist, is linked romantically with Queen in the 1938 novel The Four of Hearts and in some short stories in the 1940s but does not appear in the radio series or films and soon vanishes from the books. Queen is not given any serious romantic interests after Nikki Porter and Paula Paris disappear from the books.[3]\\nThe Queen household, an apartment on West 87th street in New York City, is shared by Ellery Queen and his father Richard Queen. It also contains a houseboy named Djuna in the earlier novels. Possibly of Roma origin, Djuna appears periodically in the canon, apparently ageless and family-free, in a supporting role as cook, receiver of parcels, valet, and occasional comedy relief.  He is the protagonist in most of the juvenile novels ghost-written under the pseudonym Ellery Queen Jr.[3][15]\\nThe radio series The Adventures of Ellery Queen was broadcast on several networks from 1939 to 1948 with the lead role played by Hugh Marlowe (1939–1940), Carleton Young (1942–1943), Sydney Smith (1943–1947), Lawrence Dobkin (1947–48) and Howard Culver (1948). All episodes in this series were paused just before the end to allow a panel of celebrities a chance to solve the mystery.[41][42][43][44] Some of the surviving scripts were published for the first time in the 2005 book The Adventure of the Murdered Moths.[45]\\nBetween 1965 and 1967, Ellery Queen\\'s Minute Mysteries were broadcast as radio fillers. They began with the radio announcer Bill Owen saying  \"This is Ellery Queen...\" and contained a short one-minute case.[15][46]\\nSome of the scripts of the television series The Adventures of Ellery Queen (1950–1951 on Dumont, 1951-1952 on ABC) were written by Helene Hanff, best known for her 1970 novel 84, Charing Cross Road.[47]Shortly after the series began, Richard Hart, who played Queen, died and was replaced by Lee Bowman.[48]\\nIn 1954, Norvin Productions produced the syndicated series Ellery Queen, Detective with Hugh Marlowe as the title character. Episodes from this series were broadcast on many local American networks and in United Kingdom between 1954 and 1959 under various titles like Mystery is my Business, Crime Detective and New Adventures of Ellery Queen.[49]\\nGeorge Nader played Queen in NBC\\'s The Further Adventures of Ellery Queen (1958–1959), but was replaced by Lee Philips in the final episodes.[50]\\nPeter Lawford starred as Ellery Queen in the 1971 television film Ellery Queen: Don\\'t Look Behind You (a loose adaptation of the 1949 novel Cat of Many Tails). Harry Morgan played Inspector Richard Queen in this film, but he is described as Ellery Queen\\'s uncle (perhaps to account for the fact that Morgan was only eight years Lawford\\'s senior, or to account for Lawford\\'s British accent).[51]\\nThe 1975 television movie Ellery Queen (aka Too Many Suspects, a loose adaptation of the 1965 novel The Fourth Side of the Triangle) led to the 1975–1976 television series of the same name starring Jim Hutton in the title role with David Wayne as his widowed father Richard Queen. This series was developed by Richard Levinson and William Link, who later won a Special Edgars Award for creating it and Columbo.[52] It was done as a period piece set in New York City in 1946–1947.[53] Sergeant Velie, Inspector Queen\\'s assistant, regularly appeared in it; he had previously appeared in the novels and the radio series, but had not been seen regularly in any of the previous television versions. Each episode contained a \"Challenge to the Viewer\" in which Queen broke the fourth wall to go over the facts of the case and encouraged the audience to try to solve the mystery before the correct solution was revealed. Eve Arden, George Burns, Joan Collins, Roddy McDowall, Milton Berle, Guy Lombardo, Rudy Vallée, and Don Ameche were among the celebrities featured in this series.[54]\\nIn 2011, in the crime series Leverage\\'s episode The 10 Li\\'l Grifters Job, Timothy Hutton\\'s character Nate Ford appears at a murder mystery party dressed as Ellery Queen, in a homage to the actor\\'s late father Jim Hutton.[55]\\nIn 1936, Dannay and Lee, in collaboration with playwright Lowell Brentano, wrote the play Danger, Men Working. The production never made it to Broadway, closing after a few performances in Baltimore and Philadelphia.[15]\\nIn 1949, novelist and playwright William Roos adapted the 1938 novel The Four of Hearts for stage, although it is not known if it was ever performed.[65]\\nIn 2016, American playwright Joseph Goodrich adapted the 1942 novel Calamity Town for stage. The play premiered at the Vertigo Theatre in Calgary, Alberta on January 23, 2016.[66]\\nEllery Queen appears as a character in some issues of Crackajack Funnies beginning in 1940, a four issue series by Superior Comics in 1949, two issues of a short-lived series by Ziff Davis in 1952, and three comics published by Dell in 1962.[67]\\nIn February 1990, Queen was used as a guest star by the comic book writer Mike W. Barr in the ninth issue of the magazine Maze Agency in the story titled The English Channeler Mystery: A Problem in Deduction.[68]\\nIn July 1996, Queen, the character, was highlighted in the Gosho Aoyoma\\'s Mystery Library section of volume 11 of the Detective Conan manga, a section of the series in which Aoyoma introduces a detective (or occasionally a villain) from mystery literature. A character also stated that he preferred Queen, the author, to Arthur Conan Doyle in volume 12 of the manga.[69]\\nEllery Queen\\'s name was attached to many games and puzzles including (Ellery Queen\\'s Great Mystery Game) Trapped in 1956, The Case of the Elusive Assassin by Ellery Queen in 1967,[70] Ellery Queen: The Case of His Headless Highness in 1973, Ellery Queen\\'s Mystery Magazine Game in 1986 and a VCR-based game called Ellery Queen\\'s Operation: Murder (loosely based on The Dutch Shoe Mystery) in 1986.[71]\\nQueen, the character, was one of the twelve fictional detectives featured on a series of stamps issued by Nicaragua in 1973 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Interpol[72] and on a similar series issued by San Marino in 1979.[73]\\n\\'Ellery Queen\\' received the following Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America:\\nThey were also runners-up for the Edgar in the following categories:\\nThe Mystery Writers of America established the Ellery Queen Award in 1983 \"to honor writing teams and outstanding people in the mystery-publishing industry\".[75]\\nUnless noted, all these titles feature Ellery Queen and Inspector Richard Queen as characters.[15][33]\\nAll ghostwriters are identified where known.[15] All titles were edited and supervised by Lee except The Blue Movie Murders (1972), which was edited and supervised by Dannay after Lee\\'s death.

       " '\\nChinese Academy of Social Sciences (MA 1981) \\nQiu Xiaolong (Chinese: 裘小龙, Chinese pronunciation /tɕʰjoʊː ˌɕjɑʊˈlʊŋ/, American English pronunciation /ˈtʃuː ˌʃaʊˈlɒŋ/; born Shanghai, China, 1953)[1] \\nis a Shanghai born-American crime novelist, English-language poet, literary translator, critic, and academic,[1] who has lived for many years in St. Louis, Missouri. He originally visited the United States in 1988 to write a book about T. S. Eliot, but following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, he remained in America to avoid persecution by the Chinese Communist Party.[2]\\nHe has published twelve crime-thriller/mystery novels as part of the Inspector Chen Cao series. These include Death of a Red Heroine, which won the Anthony Award for best first novel in 2001,[1] and A Loyal Character Dancer. All books follow Shanghai Chief Inspector Chen Cao, a poetry-quoting cop who writes poems himself, and his sidekick Detective Yu.[1] Alongside the plot, the major concern in the books is modern China itself. Each book features quotes from ancient and modern poets, Confucius, insights into Chinese cuisine, architecture, history, politics, herbology and philosophy as well as criminal procedure.\\nQiu says his father was an \"accidental capitalist\": in the late 1940s the trading company his father worked for went bankrupt and as severance received a case of unsold perfume essence. His father taught himself how to make perfume and started a small perfume factory in Shanghai.  The factory was transferred to the state in the mid-1950s, following the communist takeover of China, and thereafter his father was a manual laborer in a state-run factory.[3]\\nThe Cultural Revolution began in 1966, and the family was branded as \"black\", part of the counter-revolutionary class.  The Red Guard searched their home for two days, taking away anything regarded as decadent (jewelry, books, even electric fans); Qiu\\'s mother had a nervous breakdown, from which she never really recovered.[4]\\nQiu\\'s father came home at times with bruises from being attacked at work.\\nThen his father suffered an acute retinal detachment and was hospitalized.  In order to be eligible for eye surgery, his father had to write a confession of guilt for his capitalist bourgeois sins; but it was not deemed sufficiently repentant.  So the teenage Qiu re-wrote it, using melodramatic language and framing his father\\'s capitalist sins as no accident.  It seemed to work, as soon after his father received his surgery.  Ironically, Qiu says, \"The Red Guard’s approval of my father’s confession gave me some confidence in my writing\".[3][5]\\nQiu\\'s older brother (Qiu Xiaowei), handicapped from childhood due to infantile paralysis, also suffered a breakdown during the Cultural Revolution, being unable to work or study (the schools all being shut down).  The brother is still hospitalized, and Qiu makes regular trips to Shanghai to visit him.[6]\\nHe also has a younger sister, Xiaohong.[3]\\nAt age 16, Qiu would have been sent to the countryside to be \"re-educated\", but was allowed to stay in Shanghai because he suffered from bronchitis.  With schools closed, Qiu spent his time practicing Tai Chi in the park on the Bund; one day, he noticed people studying English on a park bench and decided to join them.[7] This interest in English grew into his academic specialty: he got a B.A. in English from East China Normal University (1978), an M.A. in English Literature from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (1981), and was an Assistant and Associate Research Professor at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences (1986 – 1988).[8]\\nIn 1988, prior to a fellowship in the United States, he married his wife Wang Lijun.[4]\\nIn 1988, Qiu went on a Ford Foundation grant to Washington University in St. Louis to work on a book about T.S. Eliot.[9]\\nEliot was born in St. Louis, and his grandfather founded the university.\\nBut in 1989, Qiu and fellow Chinese academics were stunned to watch TV reports of the severe government crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests.  On July 4, Qiu was volunteering at a St. Louis fair, selling egg rolls as a fundraiser for Chinese student protesters, when he overheard a Voice of America broadcast describing him as \"a published poet who supported the democratic movement in China.\"[9][4] Subsequent signs suggested Qiu might have trouble if he returned to China: his sister was visited by the Shanghai police who told her \"to tell me to behave myself\"; and he learned that his latest poetry book, already at the galley stage, would not be published.  So Qiu made the momentous choice to stay in the United States, and arranged for his wife to come a month later. The next year, his daughter Julia was born in St. Louis.[4]\\nQiu enrolled as student at Washington University in St. Louis and earned an M.A. (1993) and Ph.D. (1995) in Comparative Literature.  From 1996 to 2005 he was an adjunct professor there.[8]  He and his family continue to live in St. Louis.\\nQiu began writing poems in Chinese in 1978, studying under the poet Bian Zhilin (卞之琳).[10]\\nWhile an academic in China, Qiu wrote poetry and scholarly articles,[4]\\nand translated work by the modernist poet T.S. Eliot into Chinese, including The Waste Land and The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.[5]\\nEliot has been a major influence on Qiu, both in his poetry and, more obliquely, in his detective novels.  Eliot\\'s \"impersonal theory\", as opposed to the romantic tradition, holds that the poet should not identify himself with the persona of the poem.  Likewise, Inspector Chen of his novels has some of Qiu\\'s traits but is not him, \"embracing the tension between the impersonal and personal.\"[11]\\nWith Qiu\\'s 1989 decision to stay in the United States for political reasons, publishing in China became difficult and he began writing mostly in English.  After Qiu finished his Ph.D. in 1995, he visited China again after a long absence.[4]\\nHe was impressed by the astounding social changes in the country, with newly minted capitalists becoming darlings and old socialist norms fading. He tried to express some of this in a long poem “Don Quixote in China,” but was not very satisfied with the result.[12]\\nSo he decided that a novel was better for describing \"this type of dramatic change -- you can call it \\'best of times, worst of times\\'\".[9]\\nNever having written a novel before, and writing it in his second language of English, he latched onto the \"detective story as a ready-made framework\".[13]\\nThus was born his protagonist Inspector Chen Cao, like Qiu a Chinese poet and translator from Shanghai who studied English literature, but also a policeman. Qiu says, \"A cop needs to walk around, knock on people\\'s doors and talk to various people. This particular cop is very helpful because he\\'s an intellectual. He\\'s not only going to catch a murderer; he also tries to think what\\'s wrong historically, socially, culturally — in what kind of a context did this tragedy occur?\"[4]\\nQiu\\'s first Inspector Chen novel, Death of a Red Heroine, garnered him the 2001 Anthony Award for Best First Novel by a mystery writer.[13]\\nand The Wall Street Journal ranked it as the third best political novel of all time.\\nIt was based in part on an actual sex and drug scandal from the early 1990s.[4]\\nUp to 2019, Qiu has written eleven Inspector Chen novels.  The early novels are often occupied with legacies of the Cultural Revolution.  The series has tried to keep up with the continuing changes in China.  Qiu goes back regularly to visit, watches Chinese TV via satellite, and reads Chinese newspapers over the internet.[4]\\nThe seventh novel, Don\\'t Cry, Tai Lake touches on environmental contamination in modern China.[5]\\nDiscussions and revelations on Chinese microblogs (Weibo) inspired some of the eighth novel, The Enigma of China.[14][15]\\nThe scandals and downfall of the high Chinese official Bo Xilai formed a basis for the ninth novel, Shanghai Redemption.[16]\\nIn many of the Inspector Chen novels, Qiu portrays traditional Shanghai life amidst the old alleyways and also how it is rapidly disappearing with modernization.  These are also themes in two of his other works: Red Dust is a set of short stories about the inhabitants of a small lane in Shanghai, spanning Mao\\'s rise to the return of capitalism; Disappearing Shanghai combines intimate black-and-white photos of older Shanghai with poems by Qiu.[17]\\nQiu visits his old family house in Shanghai occasionally; frozen in time, it is filled with old carved furniture and devoid of plumbing (having instead a chamber pot).[14]\\nCultural background is a major influence in Qiu\\' s novels. From the Cultural Revolution to the Economic Reform, his writing reflects the society during those times. For Qiu, a lot of the writing is inspired by his own childhood experiences. Qiu also writes about Chinese cuisine in his novels, which gives Western readers a glimpse into Chinese food culture, and the Chinese people, as the Chinese people in Qiu\\'s novels are not portrayed as the stereotypical characters who are ignorant and foolish, living an exotic lifestyle. Rather, he portrays a range of realistic characters who are talented, virtuous, and open-minded.[18][19]\\nOne of the most significant stylistic symbols in Qiu Xiaolong\\' s novel is that he incorporates a lot of poetic writing, which stylistically owes more to Eliot and Yeats than it does to classical Chinese verse.[20]\\nQiu\\'s teacher, Bian ZhiLin, significantly influenced him on his career path as well. When he was pursuing his master\\'s degree, he started writing poems when his teacher Bian suggested him to do so. Furthermore, following Bian\\'s footstep, Qiu started to write novels in English as Bian was writing English novels instead of Chinese novels.[21]\\n\\nQiu believes it is an advantage rather than a disadvantage to write from a distance, which reflects the fact that he is writing about China from a distance. One may see from an angle what those living in the place fail to see.[22] According to Qiu, he is using his detective novels as a scope to view Chinese society, raising important political and social issues about contemporary China. As he said:“The \\'protagonist\\' of my novel is actually China, whereas the detective fictions are just the masks--the Western society has many bias and misunderstanding when they are introducing China. I hope to portray parts of the true China using English, and talk about the changes and confusions Chinese people are experiencing during the period of social transition.\"[23]His series of novels featuring Shanghai Inspector Chen Cao has been praised for its accurate portrayal of modern life in communist China, where a difficult transition toward a more Western society and capitalist economy conflicts with traditional Chinese values and a still-oppressive and bureaucratic government.\\nMany reviewers concluded that Qiu\\'s descriptions of China and its society were the most interesting parts of the book, and that the murder mystery serves as a device to paint the nation\\'s portrait. Connie Fletcher, writing in Booklist, declared that the book was \"fascinating for what it reveals about China as well as what it reveals about a complex man in this setting.\"[24]\\nQiu Xiaolong\\'s work has been criticized by Chinese critics and readers who claim that his depiction of China is not real as his target audience is primarily Western readers.\\nSome Chinese critics have complained that Qiu\\'s content plays to orientalism that appeals to Western perceptions of China, utilizing cultural elements like folklore, ancient poetry, and cuisine.[25] Critics also argue that Qiu\\'s novels lack deductive reasoning and suspenseful enough plot to be considered a worthy detective story.[19][26]\\nQiu\\'s themes often revolve around corruption in China. He has claimed that since the Communist party has taken over control of the media, the internet has become an important and effective way for people to speak out for justice in spite of constant censorship. He has argued that political reform in China would be impossible despite dramatic economic changes. His detective novels’ protagonist Inspector Chen often uncovers corruption while investigating case, which turns his idealism toward pessimism about the Chinese political system. He also has commented that his love of incorporating  authentic regional Chinese food into his fiction is related to feelings of nostalgia, such as  Marcel Proust famously does in Remembrance of Things Past; and that traditional food in present China still exists because of the food-safety scandals.[27]\\nThe novels have been adapted as BBC Radio 4 dramas, starring Jamie Zubairi as Chen and Dan Li as Detective Yu. The adaptations were handled by Joy Wilkinson (Death of a Red Heroine, Red Mandarin Dress, The Mao Case, Don\\'t Cry, Tai Lake and Hold Your Breath, China) and John Harvey (A Loyal Character Dancer, When Red is Black, A Case of Two Cities, Enigma of China and Shanghai Redemption).\\nIn 2011, it was announced that the Inspector Chen novels would be adapted into a series of seven feature films, to be made as a co-production between Australia and China. There has been no further word on the project since then.[28]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nSir Ian James Rankin OBE DL FRSE FRSL FRIAS[2] (born 28 April 1960) is a Scottish crime writer and philanthropist, best known for his Inspector Rebus novels.\\nRankin was born in Cardenden, Fife. His father, James, owned a grocery shop, and his mother, Isobel, worked in a school canteen.[3] He was educated at Beath High School, Cowdenbeath. His parents were horrified when he then chose to study literature at university, as they had expected him to study for a trade.[3] Encouraged by his English teacher, he persisted and graduated in 1982 from the University of Edinburgh, where he also worked on a doctorate on Muriel Spark but did not complete it.[4] He has taught at the university and retains an involvement with the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.[5] He lived in Tottenham, London, for four years and then rural France for six while he developed his career as a novelist.[6] Before becoming a full-time novelist, he worked as a grape picker, swineherd, taxman, alcohol researcher, hi-fi journalist, college secretary and punk musician in a band called the Dancing Pigs.[7][8][3]\\nRankin did not set out to be a crime writer. He thought his first novels, Knots and Crosses and Hide and Seek, were mainstream books, more in keeping with the Scottish traditions of Robert Louis Stevenson and even Muriel Spark. He was disconcerted by their classification as genre fiction. The Scottish novelist Allan Massie, who tutored Rankin while Massie was writer-in-residence at the University of Edinburgh, reassured him by saying, \"Do you think John Buchan ever worried about whether he was writing literature or not?\"[9]\\nRankin\\'s Inspector Rebus novels are set mainly in Edinburgh. They are considered major contributions to the tartan noir genre.[10] Thirteen of the novels—plus one short story— were adapted as a television series on ITV, starring John Hannah as Rebus in series 1 and 2 (4 episodes) and Ken Stott in that role in series 3–5 (10 episodes).\\nIn 2009, Rankin donated the short story \"Fieldwork\" to Oxfam\\'s Ox-Tales project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Rankin\\'s story was published in the Earth collection.[11]\\nIn 2009 Rankin stated on Radio Five Live that he would start work on a five- or six-issue run on the comic book Hellblazer, although he may turn the story into a stand-alone graphic novel instead. The Vertigo Comics panel at WonderCon 2009 confirmed that the story would be published as a graphic novel, Dark Entries, the second release from the company\\'s Vertigo Crime imprint.[12][13][14]\\nIn 2013, Rankin co-wrote the play Dark Road with Mark Thomson, the artistic director of the Royal Lyceum Theatre.[15][16] The play, which marked Rankin\\'s play-writing debut,[17] premiered at the Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, in September 2013.[18]\\nIn 2005, Rankin became the tenth best-selling writer in Britain, accounting for 10% of all crime fiction sold.[19] He writes under the pseudonym Jack Harvey as well.[4]\\nIn 2021, Rankin helped finish a draft by William McIlvanney, a prequel telling the story of an early case of McIlvanney\\'s fictional detective Jack Laidlaw. McIlvanney, whom Rankin admires, had died in 2015 leaving the manuscript unfinished.

She is well known for inspiring the television series Bones.[2]\\nKathleen Joan Toelle was born in 1948 in Chicago, Illinois.[3]\\nShe earned her Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in anthropology from American University in 1971.  In 1972, she completed her Master of Arts in physical anthropology at Northwestern University, where, in 1975, she completed her PhD, also in physical anthropology.[4][3]\\nSince 1975, Reichs has taught at Northern Illinois University, University of Pittsburgh, Concordia University, and McGill University, and currently holds a position as adjunct professor of anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. In the past, Kathy Reichs has consulted for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in North Carolina.[4][5]\\nReichs has appeared in Tanzania to testify at the United Nations\\'s International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.[6]  She has assisted Clyde Snow and the Foundation for Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology in an exhumation in the area of Lake Atitlan in the highlands of southwest Guatemala.  She was a member of the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team assigned to assist at the World Trade Center disaster.[4]\\nShe is one of 100 anthropologists certified by the American Board of Forensic Anthropology[7] and is on the board of directors of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences.  She is also affiliated with the Laboratoire des Sciences Judiciaires et de Médecine Légale for the province of Quebec.[4]\\nIn addition to technical books, as of January 2019, Reichs has written 21 novels, which have been translated into 30 languages.  20 of those novels constitute the \"Temperance Brennan\" series.[8] Her first novel, Déjà Dead, won the 1997 Arthur Ellis Award for Best First Novel.[9]\\nThe fictional heroine in her novels, Temperance \"Tempe\" Brennan, is also a forensic anthropologist.  Her lifestyle closely mimics that of her creator,[10][11] with Reichs stating that Brennan and she \"have the same CV\"[10] and that \"Some of Tempe\\'s personality traits are also mine,\"[11] but there are differences in their personal lives, such as the character\\'s alcoholism.[10]  A good portion of the novels are based on real life science, and Reichs has stated that she is \"fastidiously conscientious about getting the science right.\"\\n[12] She has used experience from her career in her novels and said about Déjà Dead that \"Everything I describe in the book, I actually did.\"[11] In the novel Grave Secrets, she uses her experience from her visit to Guatemala.[12]\\nShe has also co-written (with her son Brendan) the young adult novels series named Virals, centered on Tempe\\'s great-niece, Tory Brennan, and a pack of her friends, Ben, Hiram, Shelton, and wolfdog Cooper.\\nA stand-alone novel, Two Nights, published July 11, 2017, features Sunday Night, a tough-talking, scarred heroine.[13]\\nThe 2005 Fox television series Bones is inspired by Reichs\\' life and novels.[14] The series borrows the name of her books\\' heroine, Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan.[15] As in the books, Brennan (Emily Deschanel) is a forensic anthropologist; however, there are many differences: the television character is younger, more socially awkward,[15] and is based in the Jeffersonian, a fictionalized version of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.[15] Additionally, the TV-Brennan moonlights as an author,[14] writing about a fictional forensic anthropologist named Kathy Reichs.[16] Aside from the character\\'s name and occupation, there are few similarities between the TV show and the novels.\\nReichs works as a producer on the show to \"keep the science honest\".[15] She appeared in the second-season episode \"Judas on a Pole\", playing Professor Constance Wright, a forensic anthropologist on the Jeffersonian\\'s board of trustees who conducts Zack Addy\\'s dissertation defense.[17]\\nReichs wrote the season five episode, \"The Witch in the Wardrobe,\"[18] the season nine episode, \"The Dude in the Dam,\" and wrote the season eleven episode, \"The Stiff in the Cliff\" with her daughter Kerry.[19]\\nIn 2011, Reichs was an expert witness in the Casey Anthony murder trial. Reichs was reluctant to get involved, but later agreed and performed a full skeletal analysis of Anthony\\'s daughter, Caylee, but could not determine a cause of death.

       " '\\nRuth Barbara Rendell, Baroness Rendell of Babergh, CBE (née\\xa0Grasemann; 17 February 1930\\xa0– 2 May 2015) was an English author of thrillers and psychological murder mysteries.[1]\\nRendell is best known for creating Chief Inspector Wexford.[2] A second string of works was a series of unrelated crime novels that explored the psychological background of criminals and their victims. This theme was developed further in a third series of novels, published under the pseudonym Barbara Vine.\\nRendell was born as Ruth Barbara Grasemann in 1930, in South Woodford, Essex (now Greater London).[3] Her parents were teachers. Her mother, Ebba Kruse, was born in Sweden to Danish parents and brought up in Denmark; her father, Arthur Grasemann, was English. As a result of spending Christmas and other holidays in Scandinavia, Rendell learned Swedish and Danish.[4]  Rendell was educated at the County High School for Girls in Loughton, Essex,[3] the town to which the family moved during her childhood.\\nAfter high school, she became a feature writer for her local Essex paper, the Chigwell Times.  However, she was forced to resign after filing a story about a local sports club dinner she hadn\\'t attended and failing to report that the after-dinner speaker had died midway through the speech.[5]\\nRendell met her husband Don Rendell when she was working as a newswriter.[3] They married when she was 20, and in 1953 had a son, Simon,[6] now a psychiatric social worker who lives in the U.S. state of Colorado. The couple divorced in 1975 but remarried two years later.[7]  Don Rendell died in 1999 from prostate cancer.[6]\\nShe made the county of Suffolk her home for many years, using the settings in several of her novels. She lived in the villages of Polstead and later Groton, both east of Sudbury. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1996 Birthday Honours[8] and a life peer as Baroness Rendell of Babergh, of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk, on 24 October 1997.[9] She sat in the House of Lords for the Labour Party. In 1998 Rendell was named on a list of the party\\'s biggest private financial donors.[10] She introduced into the Lords the bill that would later become the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 (the intent was to prevent the practice).\\nIn August 2014, Rendell was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September\\'s referendum on that issue.[11]\\nRendell was a vegetarian who was described as living mostly on fruit.[12] She described herself as \"slightly agoraphobic\" and slept in a specially made four-poster bed because \"I like to feel enclosed.\"[12]\\nBaroness Rendell\\'s awards include the Silver, Gold, and Cartier Diamond Daggers from the Crime Writers\\' Association, three Edgars from the Mystery Writers of America, The Arts Council National Book Awards, and The Sunday Times Literary Award.[2] A number of her works (see the section below) have been adapted for film or television.[13][14] She was also a patron of the charity Kids for Kids[15] which helps children in rural areas of Darfur. There is a blue plaque on one of her homes, 45 Millsmead Way, in Loughton. This was unveiled by her son Simon on 24 February 2016.[16]  Four of her novels appear on the British-based Crime Writers Association Poll (1990) of the best crime fiction novels ever written: two under the Rendell name and two under her pen name of Barbara Vine.[citation needed]\\nHer Crime Writer’s Association Dagger wins (four Gold, one Silver and one Cartier Diamond) remains unmatched, as does her record of being the first author to be nominated and win under multiple names.  Her unparalleled Edgar and Dagger finalist nominations include: A Judgement In Stone (1977 Gold Dagger finalist), A Sleeping Life (1979 Edgar finalist for Best Novel), Make Death Love Me (1980 Edgar finalist for Best Novel), The Speaker Of Mandarin (1983 Gold Dagger finalist), An Unkindness Of Ravens and The Tree Of Hands (both 1986 Edgar finalists for Best Novel), A Dark-Adapted Eye (as Barbara Vine, 1986 Gold Dagger finalist), A Fatal Inversion (as Barbara Vine 1988 Macavity Award finalist for Best Novel), and Going Wrong (1990 Gold Dagger finalist.)  [17] Additionally, she was nominated four times in the Edgar “Best Short Story” category (in 1976 for The Fall Of The Coin and 1977 for People Don’t Do Such Things) winning twice for The Fallen Curtain (1975) and The New Girlfriend (1984).[18]\\nRendell had a stroke on 7 January 2015[19] and died on 2 May 2015.[20]\\nThe Ruth Rendell Award was introduced in 2016 by the National Literacy Trust. It is awarded to authors for their work in inspiring children and improving their literacy.[21]\\nRendell wrote two unpublished novels before the 1964 publication of From Doon with Death, which was purchased for £75 by John Long; it was the first mystery to feature Chief Inspector Reginald Wexford. Rendell said that the character of Wexford was based on herself.[22] The Monster in the Box, released in October 2009, was widely suggested to be Wexford\\'s last case.[23] This was incorrect; however it was the final novel featuring Wexford as an employed policeman. In the two following novels, The Vault and No Man\\'s Nightingale, he was retired but was still involved in police investigations as a \"consultant\".[24]\\nIn Introducing Chief Inspector Wexford by Daniel Mallory he says (based on a 1990 interview with Rendell by Marilyn Stasio) that Rendell refers to the hated Agatha (Christie) and that awful Marple woman; and says of St. Mary Mead that she can hardly bear to say the name of that village where one finds a lot of normal, law-abiding people living ordinary, blameless lives, who suddenly decide to murder their aunt. Well, I don’t believe that.[25] (Introducing Chief Inspector Wexford by Daniel Mallory; from 1990 Rendell interview with Marilyn Stasio)\\nIn addition to these police procedurals starring Wexford, Rendell wrote psychological crime novels exploring such themes as romantic obsession, misperceived communication, the impact of chance and coincidence, and the humanity of the criminals involved. Among such books are A Judgement in Stone, The Face of Trespass, Live Flesh, Talking to Strange Men, The Killing Doll, Going Wrong and Adam and Eve and Pinch Me. For the last novel published in her lifetime, The Girl Next Door, she returned to the Loughton of her childhood, with an implied comparison of the moral climate of wartime England and 2014.\\nRendell created a third strand of writing with the publication in 1986 of A Dark-Adapted Eye under her pseudonym Barbara Vine (the name was derived from her own middle name and her great-grandmother\\'s maiden name).[4] King Solomon\\'s Carpet, A Fatal Inversion and Asta\\'s Book (alternative U.S. title, Anna\\'s Book), among others, inhabited the same territory as her psychological crime novels while further developing themes of human misunderstandings and the unintended consequences of family secrets and hidden crimes. The author was noted for her elegant prose and sharp insights into the human mind, as well as her cogent plots and characters. Rendell injected the social changes of the last 40 years into her work, bringing awareness to such issues as domestic violence.[26]\\nThe Inspector Wexford series was successfully televised, starring George Baker as Inspector Wexford and Christopher Ravenscroft as Detective Mike Burden, under the title The Ruth Rendell Mysteries, with 48 episodes from 1987 to 2000.  Rendell praised Baker\\'s performance, stating \"It was a marvellous achievement as an actor to make him more and better than the author intended.\"[22] Many of her other works have been adapted for film and television. She said that Claude Chabrol\\'s 1995 version of A Judgement in Stone, La Cérémonie with Sandrine Bonnaire, was one of the few film adaptations of her work that she was happy with. The novel was also filmed in 1986 with Rita Tushingham.[27] Chabrol made La Demoiselle d\\'honneur in 2004, based on The Bridesmaid.\\nOther adaptations are Diary of the Dead (1976), from the book One Across, Two Down; the 1997 Pedro Almodóvar film Live Flesh;[28] The Tree of Hands, directed by Giles Foster for Granada with Lauren Bacall (U.S. title: \"Innocent Victim\"); and another version of  The Tree of Hands, Betty Fisher et autres histoires (2001, a.k.a. Alias Betty), with screenplay and direction by Claude Miller. François Ozon\\'s 2015 film The New Girlfriend was based on Rendell\\'s short story of the same name.[29] Two episodes of Tales of the Unexpected were based on Rendell\\'s short stories - \"A Glowing Future\" (series 4, episode 15) and \"People Don\\'t Do Such Things\" (series 8, episode 1).\\nA critical essay on Rendell\\'s crime novels appears in S.

       " '\\nRichard Russell Riordan Jr. (/ˈraɪərdən/ RIRE-dən; born June 5, 1964)[1] is an American author, best known for writing the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. Riordan\\'s books have been translated into forty-two languages and sold more than thirty million copies in the United States.[2] 20th Century Fox adapted the first two books of his Percy Jackson series as part of a series of films, while a Disney+ adaptation is in production. His books have spawned related media, such as graphic novels and short story collections.\\n\\nRiordan\\'s first full-length novel was Big Red Tequila, which became the first book in the Tres Navarre series. His big breakthrough was The Lightning Thief (2005), the first novel in the five-volume Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, which placed a group of modern-day adolescents in a Greco-Roman mythological setting. Since then, Riordan has written The Heroes of Olympus, a sequel to the Percy Jackson series; The Kane Chronicles, a trilogy of similar premise focusing on Egyptian mythology; and Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard, again a trilogy of similar premise focusing on Norse mythology.[3][4] Riordan also helped Scholastic Press develop The 39 Clues series and its spinoffs, and penned its first book, The Maze of Bones.[5] In 2021, he published Daughter of the Deep. His third standalone novel, The Sun and the Star, co-written with author Mark Oshiro, was published on May 2, 2023.[6] Riordan was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas. He graduated from Alamo Heights High School, and first attended the music program at North Texas State University, wanting to be a guitarist. He transferred to the University of Texas at Austin and studied English and History. He received his teaching certification in those subjects from the University of Texas at San Antonio. He taught English and Social Studies for eight years at Presidio Hill School in San Francisco.[7][8]\\nRick married Becky Riordan in 1985 on the couple\\'s shared birthday.[9] They have two sons, Haley and Patrick. They moved from San Antonio to Boston in June 2013, in conjunction with older son Haley starting college in Boston.[9][10]\\nRiordan has created several successful book series. Tres Navarre, an adult mystery series about a Texas private eye, won the Shamus, Anthony, and Edgar Awards.[11]\\nHe conceived the idea for the Percy Jackson series as bedtime stories about ancient Greek heroes for his son Haley.[12]\\nHaley had been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia, inspiring Riordan to make the titular protagonist hyperactive and dyslexic.[13] Riordan published the first novel in the series, The Lightning Thief, in 2005. Four sequels followed, with the last, The Last Olympian, in 2009. Prior to Percy Jackson, Riordan had written the Tres Navarres series, a series of mystery novels for adult readers.[14]\\nHis Percy Jackson & the Olympians series features the titular twelve-year-old who discovers he is the modern-day son of the ancient Greek god Poseidon. 20th Century Fox purchased the film rights and released two feature film adaptations between 2010 and 2013. Following the success of Percy Jackson, Riordan created The Kane Chronicles, which features a modern-day Egyptian pantheon and two new sibling protagonists, Sadie and Carter Kane.[15] Riordan also created a sequel series to Percy Jackson, The Heroes of Olympus.[3]\\nRiordan also helped create the children\\'s book series The 39 Clues. He authored several of its books, including The Maze of Bones, which topped The New York Times Best Seller list on September 28, 2008.[16] He also wrote the introduction to the Puffin Classics edition of Roger Lancelyn Green\\'s Tales of the Greek Heroes, in which he states that the book influenced him to write his Greek mythology series.[17]\\nIn 2022, Riordan co-wrote the pilot for the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series on Disney+ and is serving as an executive producer for the show.[18] Disney had earlier acquired Fox in 2019, allowing it to gain the rights to adapt the Percy Jackson novels.[19]\\nPublished individually first, then as an anthology titled Demigods and Magicians in 2016.[38]\\nIn September 2016, Disney-Hyperion announced a new Rick Riordan imprint. The imprint is called \"Rick Riordan Presents\" and was launched in March 2018. It is headed by Riordan\\'s editor, Stephanie Owens Lurie.[49]\\nLurie said that Riordan had been approached about an imprint several years ago but initially dismissed the idea because of his heavy workload. Later, he reported back that he had been \"toying with the idea\" and was \"willing to go forward with a publishing line that was not a brand extension for his own work but a platform for Riordan to bring other great writers to the attention of his vast and loyal audience.\"[49] She also said that the imprint planned to launch with two then undetermined books. \"The point of making this announcement now is to get the word out about what we’re looking for.”[49]\\nThe imprint will not publish books written by Riordan, \"whose role will be closer to curator\".[49] In an interview with the Iowa Gazette, Riordan said, \"Instead of me writing all of the mythologies we are going to look for authors who already are writing about that stuff. If I feel like I can recommend them [to my readers] ... we’re going to have them out here in the spotlight.\"[50] A focus will be placed on \"diverse, mythology-based fiction by new, emerging, and under-represented authors\". Lurie expressed hopes that the imprint will help satisfy Riordan fans without asking the author to write more than his usual two books a year.[49]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nNora Roberts (born Eleanor Marie Robertson on October 10, 1950) is an American author of over 225 romance novels.[1] She writes as J. D. Robb, Jill March and (in the U.K.) Sarah Hardesty.\\nRoberts was the first author to be inducted into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame. As of 2011, her novels had spent a combined 861 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, including 176 weeks in the number-one spot.\\nRoberts was born on October 10, 1950, in Silver Spring, Maryland, the youngest of five children.[2] Her parents have Irish ancestry, and she has described herself as \"an Irishwoman through and through\".[3] Her family were avid readers, so books were always important in her life.[4] Although she had always made up stories in her head, Roberts did not write as a child, other than essays for school. She does claim to have \"told lies. Really good ones—some of which my mother still believes.\"[5] She credits the nuns at her Catholic school for instilling in her a sense of discipline.[5]\\nDuring her second year in high school, Roberts transferred to Montgomery Blair High School,[6] where she met her first husband, Ronald Aufdem-Brinke.[7] They married, against her parents\\' wishes, in 1968, as soon as she graduated,[8][9] and settled in Boonsboro. \\nRoberts\\' husband worked at his father\\'s sheet-metal business before joining her parents in their lighting company. She gave birth to two sons, Dan and Jason. Roberts would later refer to this time period as her \"Earth Mother\" years, when she did crafts, including ceramics and sewing her children\\'s clothes.[8] The couple divorced[10] in 1983.\\nRoberts met her second husband, Bruce Wilder, a carpenter, when she hired him to build bookshelves in July 1985.[11][12] Her husband owns Turn the Page Books bookstore in Boonsboro, Maryland,[13] and works as an adult content photographer and videographer.[14]   The couple also owned the nearby historic Boone Hotel. After it was destroyed by a fire in February 2008, it was restored and reopened as the Inn BoonsBoro in 2009; the suites were inspired by and named for literary romantic couples with happy endings.[15]\\nShe is an ardent baseball fan, having been honored by the local minor league baseball team Hagerstown Suns several times.[16]\\nShe began to write during a blizzard in February 1979. Roberts states that with three feet of snow, a dwindling supply of chocolate, and no morning kindergarten for her two boys, she had little else to do.[17][18] She fell in love with the writing process, and quickly produced six manuscripts[19] which she submitted to Harlequin, the leading publisher of romance novels, but was repeatedly rejected. Roberts says,\\nI got the standard rejection for the first couple of tries, then my favorite rejection of all time. I received my manuscript back with a nice little note which said that my work showed promise, and the story had been very entertaining and well done. But that they already had their American writer. That would have been Janet Dailey.[20]Dailey would go on to be embroiled in a plagiarism scandal in which she eventually confessed to stealing some of Roberts\\' work.\\nRoberts once stated: \"You\\'re going to be unemployed if you really think you just have to sit around and wait for the muse to land on your shoulder.\"[21] She concentrates on one novel at a time,[22] writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation.[9] Rather than begin with an outline, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting.[21] She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. Roberts then  goes back to the beginning of the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the \"texture and color\" of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower.[23]\\nShe often writes trilogies, finishing the three books in a row so that she can remain with the same characters.[24] In the past, her trilogies were all released in paperback, as Roberts believed the wait for hardcover editions was too long for the reader.[4] All her new publications are released in hardcover first and e-book, with paperback editions following. \\nRoberts does much of her research over the Internet, as she has an aversion to flying.[9]\\nIn 1980, a new publisher, Silhouette Books, formed to take advantage of the manuscripts from the American writers that Harlequin had rejected.[25] Roberts\\' first novel, Irish Thoroughbred, was published in 1981, using the pseudonym Nora Roberts, a shortened form of her birth name Eleanor Marie Robertson because she assumed that all romance authors had pen names.[8]\\nBetween 1982 and 1984, Roberts wrote 23 novels for Silhouette,[8] published under various Silhouette imprints: Silhouette Sensation, Silhouette Special Edition and Silhouette Desire, as well as Silhouette Intrigue, and MIRA\\'s reissue program. In 1985, Playing the Odds, the first novel in the MacGregor family series, was published and was an immediate bestseller.[8]\\nIn 1987, she began writing single title books for Bantam. Five years later she moved to Putnam to write single title hardcovers and original paperbacks,[26] reaching the hardcover bestseller lists with her fourth hardcover release, 1996\\'s Montana Sky. Roberts has continued to release single-title novels in paperback. She still occasionally writes shorter category romances. Her attachment to the shorter category books stems from her years as a young mother of two boys without much time to read, as she \"[remembers] exactly what it felt like to want to read and not have time to read 200,000 words.\"[9]\\nRoberts was featured in Pamela Regis\\' A Natural History of the Romance Novel. Regis calls Roberts \"a master of the romance novel form\", because she \"has a keen ear for dialogue, constructs deft scenes, maintains a page-turning pace, and provides compelling characterization.\"[20] Publishers Weekly once talked about her \"wry humor and the use of different narrators, two devices that were once rarities\" in the romance novel genre.[9]\\nRoberts had long wanted to write romantic suspense in the vein of Mary Stewart, but, at the urging of her agent, she concentrated on classic contemporary romance while she built a following of readers.[9] After moving to Putnam in 1992, the publishing company quickly realized that they were unable to keep up with Roberts\\'s prolific output. They suggested that she adopt a second pseudonym so they would be able to publish more of her work each year.[24]\\nHer agent, Amy Berkover, convinced the publishers to allow Roberts to write romantic suspense under the new name.[9]  She chose the pseudonym D. J. MacGregor, but right before publication, discovered it was in use by another author.[17]  Instead, her first romantic suspense novel was published in 1995 under the pseudonym J. D. Robb. The initials \"J. D.\" were taken from her sons, Jason and Dan, while \"Robb\" is a shortened form of Roberts.\\nAs J. D. Robb, Roberts has published a series of futuristic science fiction police procedurals. These books, all part of the in Death series, feature detective Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke and are set in a mid-21st century New York City. Despite the emphasis on solving a crime in each of the books, the overall theme of the series is the development of the relationship between Eve and Roarke.[24] When the in Death series began, neither Roberts nor her publisher acknowledged that she was the author. They hoped to allow the series to stand on its own merits and build its own following.[27]\\nAfter publishing 18 novels in the in Death series, Putnam published the nineteenth, Divided in Death, first in hardcover. The book became Roberts\\' first bestselling novel of 2004.[28]\\nAs of March 2022, Roberts has published 54 novels plus ten novellas in the in Death series.[29]\\nRoberts wrote a story for a magazine titled Melodies of Love under the pseudonym Jill March.[17] She has also been known as Sarah Hardesty in the UK.

Her first appearance on The New York Times Best Seller list came in 1991,[22] and between 1991 and 2001, she had 68 New York Times Bestsellers, counting hardbacks and paperbacks. [30] In 2001, Roberts had 10 best-selling mass-market paperbacks, according to Publishers Weekly, not counting those books written under the J.D. Robb name. In September 2001, for the first time Roberts took the numbers 1 and 2 spots on the Publishers Weekly bestseller list, as her romance Time and Again was number one, and her J.D.

The practice came to light after a reader read Roberts\\' Sweet Revenge and Dailey\\'s Notorious back-to-back; she noticed several similarities and posted the comparable passages on the Internet. Calling the plagiarism \"mind-boggling\", Roberts sued Dailey.[9] Dailey acknowledged the plagiarism and attributed it to a psychological disorder. She admitted that both Aspen Gold and Notorious lifted heavily from Roberts\\' work. Both of those novels were pulled from print after Dailey\\'s admission.[37][38] In April 1998, Dailey settled the case. Roberts donated the settlement to various literary causes including the Literacy Volunteers of America (now ProLiteracy).[9][39][40][41]\\nRoberts joined the chorus strongly criticizing fellow romance writer Cassie Edwards, who had lifted many passages from much older sources (many in the public domain) without giving credit, forcing Edwards out of the business.[42][43]\\nIn 2019 Roberts, along with other authors, was a victim of plagiarism by Cristiane Serruya.[44][45][46]\\nRoberts has been included repeatedly on the Giving Back Fund\\'s annual lists of the most philanthropic celebrities, with the bulk of her donations going to the Nora Roberts Foundation.[47][48][49] The foundation financially supports organizations that promote literacy and the arts, assist children and engage in humanitarian efforts.

In 1978, he moved to Minneapolis and started writing for The Saint Paul Pioneer Press as a features reporter; in 1980 he became a daily columnist. That year, he was a Pulitzer finalist for a series of stories on Native American culture.[9] In 1985, during the Midwest farm crisis, he wrote a series titled \"Life on the Land: an American Farm Family,\" which followed a typical southwest Minnesota farm family through the course of a full year. For that work, he won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing[9] and the American Society of Newspaper Editors award for Non-Deadline Feature Writing. He worked part-time at the Pioneer Press in 1989[10] and left the following year.\\nCamp is an avid fiction reader himself. When asked in 2018, \"What\\'s your favorite book of all time?\" by the New York Times, he responded, \"An impossible question.

       " '\\nDorothy Leigh Sayers (/sɛərz/;[n 1] 13 June 1893 – 17 December 1957), known professionally as Dorothy L. Sayers, was an English crime novelist, playwright, translator and critic.\\nBorn in Oxford, Sayers was brought up in rural East Anglia and educated at Godolphin School in Salisbury and Somerville College, Oxford, graduating with first class honours in medieval French. She worked as an advertising copywriter between 1922 and 1929 before success as an author brought her financial independence. Her first novel Whose Body? was published in 1923. Between then and 1939 she wrote ten more novels featuring the upper-class amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey. In 1930, in Strong Poison, she introduced a leading female character, Harriet Vane, the object of Wimsey\\'s love. Harriet appears sporadically in future novels, resisting Lord Peter\\'s proposals of marriage until Gaudy Night in 1935, six novels later.\\nSayers moved the genre of detective fiction away from pure puzzles lacking characterisation or depth, and became recognised as one of the four \"Queens of Crime\" of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction of the 1920s and 1930s, along with Agatha Christie, Margery Allingham and Ngaio Marsh. She was a founder member of the Detection Club, and worked with many of its members in producing novels and radio serials collaboratively, such as the novel The Floating Admiral in 1931.\\nFrom the mid‐1930s Sayers wrote plays, mostly on religious themes; they were performed in English cathedrals and broadcast by the BBC. Her radio dramatisation of the life of Christ, The Man Born to Be King (1941–42), initially provoked controversy but was quickly recognised as an important work. From the early 1940s her main preoccupation was translating the three books of Dante\\'s Divine Comedy into colloquial English. She died unexpectedly at her home in Essex, aged 64, before completing the third book.\\nSayers was born on 13 June 1893 at the Old Choir House in Brewer Street, Oxford; she was the only child of the Rev Henry Sayers and his wife Helen (Nell) Mary, née Leigh.[2] Henry Sayers, born at Tittleshall, Norfolk, was the son of the Rev Robert Sayers, from County Tipperary, Ireland.[3][4] At the time of Sayers\\'s birth her father was headmaster of Christ Church Cathedral School and chaplain of Christ Church, one of the colleges of the University of Oxford.[4] Her mother, born in Shirley, Hampshire, was a daughter of a solicitor descended from landed gentry on the Isle of Wight.[5] Sayers was proud of the Leigh connection and later considered calling herself \"D. Leigh Sayers\" in professional matters, before settling for \"Dorothy L. Sayers\"—insisting on the inclusion of the middle initial.[6]\\nWhen Sayers was four years old her father accepted the post of rector of Bluntisham-cum-Earith in the Fen Country of East Anglia. The appointment carried a better stipend than the Christ Church posts and the large rectory had considerably more room than the family\\'s house in Oxford,[7] but the move cut them off from the city\\'s lively social scene. This affected the rector and his wife differently: he was scholarly and self-effacing; she, like many of the Leigh family—including her great-uncle Percival Leigh, a contributor to the humorous magazine Punch—was outgoing and gregarious and she missed the stimulation of Oxford society.[8]\\nIn the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB), Catherine Kenney writes that the lack of siblings and neighbouring children of her own age or class made Sayers\\'s childhood fairly solitary, although her parents were loving and attentive. Sayers formed one lasting friendship in these years: Ivy Shrimpton, eight years her senior, her first cousin and Nell\\'s niece. Shrimpton, raised in California as an infant but educated in an Anglican convent school in Oxford, made extended visits to the Bluntisham rectory. Kenney writes that the two formed a lifelong friendship through \"a youthful sharing of books, imagination, and confidences\". Otherwise, Kenney comments, Sayers, \"like many future authors\\xa0... lived largely a life of books and stories\". She could read by the age of four, and made full use of her father\\'s extensive library as she grew up.[3]\\nSayers was educated chiefly at home. Her father began teaching her Latin before she was seven, and she had lessons from governesses in other subjects, including French and German. In January 1909, when she was fifteen, her parents sent her to Godolphin School, a boarding school in Salisbury. Her biographer Barbara Reynolds writes that Sayers took a lively part in the life of the school, acting in plays, some of which she wrote and produced herself, singing (sometimes solo), playing the violin and the viola in the school orchestra and forming highly charged friendships.[9]\\nDespite some excellent teachers, Sayers was not happy at the school. Joining at the age of fifteen, rather than the school\\'s normal starting age of eight, she was seen as an outsider by some of the other girls, and not all the staff approved of her independence of mind.[10] As an Anglican with strong high church views, she was repelled by the form of Christianity practised at Godolphin, described by her biographer James Brabazon as \"a low church pietism, drab and mealy-mouthed\", which came close to putting her off religion completely.[11]\\nDuring an outbreak of measles at the school in 1911 Sayers nearly died. Her mother was allowed to stay at the school, where she nursed her daughter who recovered in time to study and sit for a Gilchrist Scholarship, which she was awarded in March 1912.[12][13] Among the purposes of these scholarships was to sponsor women to study at Oxbridge colleges. Sayers\\'s scholarship, worth £50 a year for three years, enabled her to study modern languages at Somerville College, Oxford.[13][n 2] After her experiences with the religious regime at the Godolphin, Sayers chose Somerville in preference to the other Oxford college for women, Lady Margaret Hall, which was closely connected to the Church of England; Somerville was secular.[16]\\nAccording to Kenney, Somerville had a tradition of nurturing women to play leading roles in the arts and public life, and the college suited Sayers well.[3][17] She enjoyed her time there, and, she later said, acquired a scholarly method and habit of mind which served her throughout her life. She was a distinguished student, and, in Kenney\\'s view, Sayers\\'s novels and essays reflect her liberal education at Oxford.[3] Among the lifelong friends she made at Somerville was Muriel St. Clare Byrne, who later played an important part in Sayers\\'s career and became her literary executor.[18]\\nSayers was co-founder, with Amphilis Middlemore and Charis Ursula Barnett, of the Mutual Admiration Society, a literary society where female students would read and critique each other\\'s work. Sayers gave the group its name, remarking, \"if we didn\\'t give ourselves that title, the rest of College would\".[19] The society was a forerunner of the Inklings, the informal literary discussion group at Oxford;[20] Sayers never belonged to the latter—an all-male group of writers—but became friendly with C. S. Lewis and other members.[21]\\nSayers, who was considered to have a good contralto voice,[22] joined the Oxford Bach Choir and developed an unrequited passion for its director, Hugh Allen.[3] Later in her time at Oxford, she became attracted by a fellow student named Roy Ridley, later chaplain of Balliol, on whose appearance and manner she later drew for her best-known character, Lord Peter Wimsey.[23] She studied diligently, with the encouragement of her tutor, Mildred Pope, and in 1915 she was awarded first class honours in what was termed modern (in fact medieval) French in her final examinations.[3] Despite her examination results, she was ineligible to be awarded a degree, as Oxford did not formally confer them on women. When the university changed its rules in 1920, Sayers was among the first to have her degree officially awarded.[24]\\nAfter graduating from Oxford, Sayers, who had begun writing verse in childhood, brought out two slim volumes of poetry, Op. I (1916) and Catholic Tales and Christian Songs (1918).[3][n 3] To earn a living she taught modern languages at Hull High School for Girls.[26] Teaching did not greatly appeal to her, and in 1917 she secured a post with the publisher and bookseller Basil Blackwell in Oxford.[27] Returning to the city suited her well. A younger contemporary, Doreen Wallace, later described her in these years:\\nThe post with Blackwell lasted for two years, after which Sayers moved to France. She was engaged in 1919 by a school near Verneuil-sur-Avre in Normandy as assistant to Eric Whelpton, who was teaching English there.[29] She had been in love with him at Oxford, and he was among the models for the appearance and character of Wimsey.[3] In 1921 Sayers began a relationship with a fellow writer, John Cournos, which intensified after her return to England shortly afterwards.[30]\\nIn 1922, after moving back to England, Sayers took a job as a copywriter at S. H. Benson, then Britain\\'s largest advertising agency.[3] Although she had reservations about the misleading nature of advertising,[n 4] she became a skilled practitioner, and remained with the firm until the end of 1929. She originated successful campaigns for products including Guinness stout and Colman\\'s mustard. She is sometimes credited with coining the slogan \"My Goodness, My Guinness\",[3] but it dates from 1935, more than five years after she left Benson\\'s.[32] She was, though, responsible for the introduction of the Guinness toucan, painted by the artist John Gilroy, for which she penned accompanying verse such as \"If he can say as you can/Guinness is good for you/How grand to be a Toucan/Just think what Toucan do\".[33] The toucan was used in Guinness\\'s advertisements for decades.[34] Kenney writes that at Benson\\'s, Sayers again enjoyed \"some of the fun and camaraderie she had experienced as a student at Oxford\".[3]\\nIn her off-duty hours Sayers devoted herself to writing fiction. Detective novels were popular, and Sayers saw an opportunity to produce remunerative, accessible but well-written works in the genre. She mastered the mechanics of the craft by making a close analytical study of the best models.[35] In a biographical sketch, a later crime novelist, J. I. M. Stewart, wrote:\\nThe first of Sayers\\'s series of detective novels, Whose Body?, featured her amateur detective Lord Peter Wimsey. She had begun writing it before joining Bensons, and it was published in 1923, to mixed reviews; one critic thought it a \"somewhat complicated mystery\\xa0... clever but crude\", and another found the aristocratic Wimsey unconvincing as a detective and the story \"a poor specimen of sensationalism\".[37] Some other reviews were more favourable: \"the solution does not, as is so often the case, come as anti-climax to disappoint expectations and lead the reader to feel that he has been \\'had\\'\\xa0... We hope to hear from the noble sleuth again\";[38] \"We had hardly thought a woman writer could be so robustly gruesome\\xa0... a very diverting problem\";[39] \"First-rate construction\\xa0... a thoroughly satisfactory yarn from start to finish\".[40]\\nSayers\\'s relationship with Cournos continued until 1923.[30] It remained unconsummated because Cournos did not want children and Sayers refused, for religious reasons, to use contraception.[41] After that affair ended she met a man, Bill White, by whom she had a son in 1924. The novelist A. N. Wilson describes White as \"motorcycling rough trade\".[42] That liaison was short-lived—White turned out to be married—and the son, whom Sayers named John Anthony, was brought up by Ivy Shrimpton, who already had foster children in her care.[43] Sayers concealed her son\\'s parentage from him and from the world in general. She was known to him at first as Cousin Dorothy, and she later posed as his adoptive mother. Only after her death were the facts made explicit.[44]\\nWhose Body?, published in both Britain and the US, sold well enough for the London publishers, Fisher Unwin, to ask for a sequel.[45] Before that was published Sayers featured Wimsey in a short story, \"The Fascinating Problem of Uncle Meleager\\'s Will\", published in Pearson\\'s Magazine in July 1925,[46] which, together with other short stories centred on Wimsey, came out in book form in Lord Peter Views the Body in 1928.[47]\\nClouds of Witness, the second Wimsey novel, was published in 1926, and was well received. The Daily News commented: \\nOther reviewers wrote of a \"well-written and pulsating mystery story, with an astonishing number of clues cleverly evolved, and totally unexpected conclusion\",[49] and a \"pleasantly-going and smartly-written detective story\";[50] another commented, \"Miss Sayers is frankly out to thrill us; but her novel is something far other than a typical shocker. Her characters (especially her hero) are very much alive, and she has an admirable narrative style and great constructive skill\".[51] With this second novel, Sayers was being compared with the established crime novelist Agatha Christie as an author of detective stories that that were also entertaining novels about human beings.[48]\\nIn the same year Sayers married a divorcé, Captain Oswald Arthur (known as \"Mac\") Fleming, a well-known journalist.[35] Her son was given the latter\\'s surname but was not brought to live with Sayers and her husband. The marriage, happy at first, grew more difficult as Fleming\\'s health declined, but the couple stayed together until his death in 1950.[3]\\nThe series of Wimsey novels continued with Unnatural Death in 1927,[n 6] and The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club in 1928.[53] In that year Sayers published Lord Peter Views the Body and edited and introduced an anthology of other writers\\' works, Great Short Stories of Detection, Mystery and Horror, retitled for its American edition the following year as The Omnibus of Crime.[52]\\nIn 1929, her last year as an employee of Benson\\'s, Sayers and her husband moved from London to the small Essex town of Witham, which remained their home for the rest of their lives.[54] In that year she published Tristan in Brittany, a verse and prose translation of the 12th-century poetic fragments The Romance of Tristan by Thomas of Britain.[55] The scholar George Saintsbury wrote an introduction to the book, and Sayers was praised for making a historically important poem available for the first time in modern English.[56]\\nIn 1930 Sayers became a founder member of the Detection Club. This grew from informal dinners arranged by Anthony Berkeley for writers of detective fiction \"for the enjoyment of each other’s company and for a little shop talk\".[57] The dinners proved such a success that the participants agreed to form themselves into a club, under the presidency of G. K. Chesterton, whom Sayers admired.[57][n 7] She was one of the club\\'s most enthusiastic members; she devised its elaborate initiation ritual in which new members swore to write without relying on \"Divine Revelation, Feminine Intuition, Mumbo Jumbo, Jiggery Pokery, Coincidence or the Act of God\" and \"to observe a seemly moderation in the use of Gangs, Conspiracies, Death-Rays, Ghosts, Hypnotism, Trap-Doors, Chinamen, Super-Criminals and Lunatics, and utterly and forever to forswear Mysterious Poisons unknown to Science\".[59] The club charged no subscription fees, and to raise money for the acquisition of premises members contributed to collaborative works for broadcast or print.[60] The first, organised by Sayers, was Behind the Screen (1930) in which six club members took it in turn to read their own fifteen-minute episodes of a crime mystery on BBC radio.[n 8]\\nSayers published two novels in 1930. Prompted by a suggestion from a fellow author, Robert Eustace, she worked on The Documents in the Case. Eustace, a medical practitioner, provided the main plot device and scientific details; Sayers turned them into prose, hoping to write a notable novel in the manner of Wilkie Collins, whom she admired.[62] She was working on a biography of Collins and adopted his first person narrative technique in a story mostly told in exchanges of letters between the characters. Peter Wimsey does not appear in the book: Brabazon writes that Sayers \"tasted the joys of freedom from Wimsey\".[63] Reviews were favourable without being laudatory.[64] In The Graphic, Evelyn Waugh contrasted Sayers and Christie:\\nSayers was disappointed with the book, and reproached herself for failing to do better with the material provided by her co-author.[62] Her second book of the year was Strong Poison, in which she introduced the character Harriet Vane, whom Wimsey proves innocent of a murder charge. Sayers originally intended that at the end of the book Wimsey would marry Harriet and retire from detection, but financial necessity led the author to postpone their union for another five novels while Wimsey provided his creator with a good income.[66] Brabazon describes Harriet as Sayers\\'s alter ego, sharing many attributes—favourable and otherwise—with the author.[66] Harriet is described by Wimsey\\'s mother as \"so interesting and a really remarkable face, though perhaps not strictly good-looking, and all the more interesting for that\".[67] Sayers had never been conventionally beautiful, and after attending one of her lectures in the 1930s Mary Ellen Chase wrote of her, \"There can be few plainer women on earth than Dorothy Sayers [but] I have never come across one so magnetic to listen to\".[68]\\nIn 1931 Sayers collaborated with Detection Club colleagues on a longer serial for the BBC, The Scoop, and on a book, The Floating Admiral.[57] She edited a second collection of Great Short Stories of Detection, Mystery and Horror, and as a solo effort wrote The Five Red Herrings, published in the US as Suspicious Characters.[69] Harriet Vane does not appear in that novel, but is the central character in the next Wimsey book, Have His Carcase, published in 1932. Wimsey solves the murder but is no more successful in winning Harriet\\'s love than he had been in Strong Poison.[70] Have His Carcase was well received. The Scotsman called it a book to keep the most jaded reviewer out of bed until the small hours;[71] The Times said that the final twist \"is really startling and ingenious, and though the reader is given a perfectly fair chance of guessing it none but the most ingenious can hope to do so\";[72] and the reviewer in The Liverpool Echo called Sayers \"the greatest of all detective story writers\", though worrying that her plots were so clever that some readers might struggle to keep up with them.[73]\\nOver the following two years Sayers published two Wimsey novels (neither featuring Harriet Vane)—Murder Must Advertise (1933) and The Nine Tailors (1934)—and a collection of short stories, Hangman\\'s Holiday, featuring not only the patrician Wimsey but also a proletarian salesman and solver of mysteries, Montague Egg.[74] She edited a third and final volume of Great Stories of Detection, Mystery and Horror and began reviewing crime novels for The Sunday Times. Her reviews covered works by most of her important contemporaries, including her fellow \"Queens of Crime\" of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction—Christie and Margery Allingham.[3][75] Kenney comments that much of Sayers\\'s thinking on the mystery novel and literature generally can be gleaned from her reviews, which reveal much about her attitude to art.[3]\\nSayers did not enjoy writing Murder Must Advertise and thought it an artistic failure:\\nKenney describes the book as \"flawed but brilliant\", and ranks it below the final three Wimsey novels—The Nine Tailors, Gaudy Night and Busman\\'s Honeymoon—in terms of its literary status in relation to more manifestly serious fiction of Sayers\\'s day.[3]\\nLike Murder Must Advertise, The Nine Tailors draws on the author\\'s personal experiences. As her portrait of the Rev Theodore Venables \"tenderly evoked\" her father, \"unworldly, self-effacing [and] lovable\", as Reynolds puts it.[77] The rectory in which Wimsey and his manservant, Bunter, are offered refuge after a car crash, resembles that in which Sayers grew up.[77] The book gained enthusiastic notices. In The News Chronicle, Charles Williams wrote that it was \"not merely admirable; it is adorable.\\xa0... It is a great book\".[78] The Daily Herald said, \"This is unquestionably Miss Sayers\\' best—until the next one\".[79]\\nIn 1935 Sayers published what she intended to be the last Wimsey novel, Gaudy Night, set in Harriet Vane\\'s old Oxford college. There is attempted murder but Wimsey identifies the culprit in time to prevent further harm. At the end of the book Wimsey proposes to Harriet (in Latin) and is accepted (also in Latin).[80] In Oxford in May, and in London in June, Sayers delivered a lecture entitled \"Aristotle on Detective Fiction\", humorously contending that in his Poetics, Aristotle shows that what he most wished for was a good detective story.[81] The same year Sayers worked on a script for a film to be called The Silent Passenger. Although she was promised editorial control, it was not forthcoming and the script was altered; according to her biographer David Coombes, the Wimsey character \"looked like a member of the Mafia\".[82]\\nSayers was growing tired of the solitary vocation of a novelist, and was glad to collaborate with her old university friend Byrne on a new Wimsey story written for the theatre.[83] Busman\\'s Honeymoon, \"a detective comedy in three acts\", had a short provincial tour before opening in the West End. Sayers, who kept in close contact with her son, sent him an account of the demanding rehearsals for the opening, a milieu new to her.[84] The London premiere was at the Comedy Theatre in December 1936. Dennis Arundell and Veronica Turleigh played Wimsey and Harriet.[85] It ran for more than a year,[86] and while it was still running, Sayers rewrote it as a novel, published in 1937, the last of her full-length books featuring Wimsey.[3]\\nWhile the play was in rehearsal the organisers of the Canterbury Festival invited Sayers to write a drama for performance in Canterbury Cathedral, following the staging there of T. S. Eliot\\'s Murder in the Cathedral, and other plays.  The result, The Zeal of Thy House, was her dramatisation in blank verse of the life and work of William of Sens, one of the architects of the cathedral.[87] It opened in June 1937, was well reviewed, and made a profit for the festival.[88]\\nThe following year Sayers returned to a religious theme with He That Should Come, a radio Nativity play, broadcast by the BBC on Christmas Day,[89] and in 1939 the Canterbury Festival staged another of her plays, The Devil to Pay.[69] In the same year she published a collection of short stories, In the Teeth of the Evidence—featuring Wimsey, Egg and others[90]—and began a series of articles for The Spectator called The Wimsey Papers, using Wimsey and his family and friends to convey Sayers\\'s thoughts on life and politics in the early weeks of the Second World War.[91]\\nFor the theatre Sayers wrote a comedy, Love All, a wry take on the eternal triangle. It opened in a London fringe theatre in April 1940. Notices were friendly—The Times said that Sayers poked some agreeable fun at a number of conventions, sentimental, literary, and theatrical and The Stage called the play \"very amusing and provocative\"[92]—but at that stage of the war there was no demand for another light comedy in the West End, and there was no transfer.[93]\\nThe task that preoccupied Sayers from the 1940s to the end of her life was her translation of Dante Alighieri\\'s Divine Comedy. She said she began it after reading the original Italian version in an air-raid shelter during bombing raids.[n 9] She saw parallels between the writing and the state of the world during the war.[95]\\nShe thought Dante was \"simply the most incomparable story-teller who ever set pen to paper\",[97] and in addition to the parallels of the world during war, she also saw similarities in his outlook on the lack of faith, declining morality, dishonesty, exploitation, disharmony and other problems.[97] Once she began to read, she found herself unable to stop:\\nAs well as her work on Dante, Sayers continued to write drama. At the BBC\\'s request she created a cycle of twelve radio plays portraying the life of Christ, The Man Born to be King (1941–42), which, Kenney observes, were broadcast to \"a huge audience of Britons during the darkest days of the Second World War\".[3] Sayers insisted from the outset on realism, modern speech and a portrayal of Jesus. He had appeared as a character in numerous Passion plays in earlier centuries, but this was the first time an actor had played the part on radio; the press referred to \"a radio Oberammergau\".[98] Some conservative Christians expressed outrage. The Lord\\'s Day Observance Society called it a \"revolting imitation of the voice of our Divine Saviour and Redeemer\" and declared, \"to impersonate the Divine Son of God in this way is an act of irreverence bordering on the blasphemous\".[99] The actor Robert Speaight, who played Jesus, said the plays were successful because \"we did not approach the parts in a reverential frame of mind. We approached them exactly as if it was any other kind of play\".[100] As the series progressed, the controversy died down. The BBC\\'s religious advisory committee, representing all the major Christian denominations, was united in support of the cycle, which came to be regarded as one of Sayers\\'s greatest achievements.[101]\\nSayers\\'s other main work from the wartime years was her extended essay The Mind of the Maker, arguing that human creativity is the attribute that gives mankind its best chance of understanding, however imperfectly, the nature of God\\'s mind.[102] Between 1944 and 1949 she published two volumes of essays and a collection of stories for children, and wrote another religious play, The Just Vengeance, commissioned for the 750th anniversary celebrations of Lichfield Cathedral, which, she later said, pleased theologians more than it pleased the actors.[103]\\nIn 1949 Penguin Books published The Divine Comedy, Cantica I, Hell in Sayers\\'s translation. Notices were excellent. One reviewer wrote, \"Her translation\\xa0... is not only scholarly but is being hailed as the best English translation of that poem\".[104] In The Observer, Sir Ronald Storrs praised the \"illuminating\" translation and Sayers\\'s \"compendious notes\", and said that future readers would be \"profoundly in her debt\".[105] The Chicago Tribune criticised some of the archaisms in Sayers\\'s version, but concluded \"but all in all it looks to me like the translation to read\\xa0... you can\\'t read very far into it and still think Dante is dull\".[106]\\nIn 1950 Sayers was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by the University of Durham.[n 10] After years of declining health her husband died at their home in Witham.[108] The following year, for the Festival of Britain, she wrote her last play, The Emperor Constantine, described by The Stage as \"long, rambling, episodic, and wholly absorbing\".[109]\\nSayers made a last foray into crime fiction in 1953 with No Flowers By Request, another collaborative serial, published in The Daily Sketch, co-written with E. C. R. Lorac, Anthony Gilbert, Gladys Mitchell and Christianna Brand.[110] The following year she published Introductory Papers on Dante,[111] and in 1955 Penguin Books published Purgatory, the second volume of her translation of The Divine Comedy.[112] Like its predecessor, it enjoyed substantial sales.[113] The last books by Sayers were The Song of Roland, translated from the French, and a second volume of papers on Dante (both 1957).[114]\\nOn 17 December 1957 Sayers died suddenly at her home in Witham, aged 64; she was cremated six days later at Golders Green Crematorium.[115] Her translation of the third and final volume of The Divine Comedy, two-thirds complete, was finished by Reynolds.[116]\\nAccording to the literary critic Bernard Benstock, Sayers\\'s reputation as a novelist is based on her works featuring Peter Wimsey, the aristocratic amateur detective who appears in eleven of her twelve novels and four collections of short stories.[117][118] Benstock considers the novels to be \"of consistently high literary quality\" displaying \"witty repartee and erudite epigrams\",[119] while Bruce Merry, an analyst of detective fiction, thinks them \"intellectually\\xa0... resourceful and highly refined\", even though they have not aged well.[120]\\nThe crime writer Julian Symons observes that the growth of the Golden Age writing in Britain during the inter-war years came \"not by adherence to the rules but through a measure of revolt against them\" by Sayers, Anthony Berkeley and Agatha Christie.[121] For Sayers, her revolt lay partly in character development and the introduction of a love interest for Wimsey, allowing emotions to become apparent in the story: Wimsey falls in love with Harriet Vane in Strong Poison, romances her in Gaudy Night and marries her in Busman\\'s Honeymoon. The last of these was sub-titled \"A love story with detective interruptions\",[122] and was described in The Times Literary Supplement as \"a love story and a detective story, and so much more besides\".[123]\\nThe revolt against the rules was shown in the development of the Wimsey character.[122] Several critics have considered that on Wimsey\\'s first appearance—in Whose Body?—he is not a fully rounded character.[n 11] By the final Wimsey novel—Busman\\'s Honeymoon—he has undergone a change to become a sensitive scholar, feeling guilt over condemning a murderer (\"a poor devil who hasn’t got a bean in the world and hasn’t done us any harm\"[129]) to hanging, while he struggles with the shell shock he suffered from the war. The change is one that the writer P. D. James describes as \"less a development than a metamorphosis\".[125] Sayers\\'s portrayal of Wimsey\\'s mental crises as a result of shell shock and aspects of the war run throughout the Wimsey series.[130][n 12]\\nSayers\\'s use of a monied aristocrat has been criticised. In 1963, in an article in The Listener, the cultural critic Martin Green described Sayers as \"one of the world\\'s masters of the pornography of class-distinction\", while he outlined Wimsey\\'s treatment of his social inferiors.[132] The writer Colin Watson in his study of interwar thrillers, Snobbery with Violence, also saw in Wimsey the habit of mocking those from different social classes;[133] for Sayers\\'s descriptions of the wealthy and titled, he described her a \"sycophantic bluestocking\".[134] Eric Sandberg, in his examination of the Wimsey novels, dissents from this view, and considers \"it would not be accurate to describe Sayers\\'s depiction of the aristocracy as adulatory or sycophantic\" as, with the exception of Wimsey and his mother, other members of the upper classes are written as being dim or archaic.[135] Peter Latham, in his examination of snobbery in modern novels Am I a Snob?, also sees Sayers\\'s treatment of the upper classes as satire. He considers that she \"revels in the comedy of snobbery and the absurdity of pretension, making even her detective a ridiculously affected stereotype\".[136]\\nA 2021 study by Laura Mayall draws parallels between Wimsey and his valet Bunter and the P. G. Wodehouse characters Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, particularly around the choice of clothing—determined by the valet, rather than his employer; Mayall concludes there is parody in such interactions, showing Sayers mocking stereotypes, rather than portraying reality.[137] The literature academic Valerie Pitt highlights an interchange between Bunter and Wimsey from The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club which she considers parody: \"Bunter produced an innocent looking monocle which was, in reality, a powerful magnifier. \\'And the finger-print powder is in your lordship\\'s right-hand coat pocket\\'\".[138][139] Pitt sees comparisons between the Wimsey novels and the Sherlock Holmes novels of Arthur Conan Doyle, together with the influence of Wodehouse on the  character. Bunter she sees as fulfilling the role of both Jeeves and Dr Watson, while there are also parallels between the roles of Sayers\\'s Chief Inspector Charles Parker and Conan Doyle\\'s Inspector Lestrade, just as there is with Wimsey\\'s unofficial assistance from Miss Climpson and Holmes\\'s Baker Street Irregulars.[140] Physically there is a resemblance between Wimsey and Wooster; one of the characters in Murder Must Advertise describes him as \"Tow-coloured, supercilious-looking blighter.\\xa0... Cross between Ralph Lynn and Bertie Wooster.\"[141]\\nSayers wrote on religious themes from early in her life. Her second volume of verse, Catholic Tales and Christian Songs (1918), included a short satirical verse play, \"The Mocking of Christ\", but it was not until the late 1930s that she turned away from detective fiction to concentrate on religious subjects. Within about a decade her reputation was based as much on her writing as a \"lay Christian apologist\" as on her novels.[142]\\nThe Zeal of Thy House, the play she wrote for the Canterbury Festival in 1937, went on tour nationally, played a limited West End season, and was well reviewed.[143] A London critic wrote, \"Not only is this play sincere and impressive\\xa0... it is good entertainment\\xa0... an essentially serious treatment of theological questions\\xa0... which with rare skill Miss Sayers has made at the same time dramatic\".[144] According to the literary academic Crystal Downing, the staging of The Zeal of Thy House \"radically changed Sayers\\'s life\".[145] The success of the play led the festival to commission another, produced two years later. This was a version of the Faust legend, called The Devil to Pay. Between these two stage works Sayers wrote a Nativity play for the BBC and two articles on theology for The Sunday Times.[143]\\nFrom 1940 Sayers published volumes containing studies, lectures, and essays on theological topics.[143] According to the historian Lucy Wooding the plays and the books combine a high degree of professional competence with \"fresh and penetrating insights into the meaning of the Christian faith in the modern world\".[146] Wooding writes that Sayers was loosely associated with several other representatives of \"what might be called lay orthodoxy\", including C. S. Lewis, Charles Williams, and T. S. Eliot, writing before and after the Second World War.[146]\\nSayers insisted in an article titled \"Playwrights are Not Evangelists\" that her purpose was not to proselytise. Her view of theological aesthetics was that a work of art will speak to its audience only if the artist serves the work rather than trying to preach. She said that her motive in writing The Man Born to Be King was not \"to do good\", but to tell the story to the best of her ability\\xa0... \"in short, to make as good a work of art as I could\".[147]\\nIn a 2017 study for the Ecclesiastical History Society, Margaret Wiedemann Hunt writes that The Man Born to Be King was \"an astonishing and far-reaching innovation\", not only because it used colloquial speech and because Jesus was portrayed by an actor (something not then permitted in theatres in Britain), but also because \"it brought the gospels into people\\'s lives in a way that demanded an imaginative response\".[148] In preparation for writing the cycle, Sayers made her own translations of the Gospels from the original Greek into modern English; she hoped to persuade listeners that the 17th-century King James version was over-familiar to churchgoers and incomprehensible to everyone else.[149] In a 1984 study of religious broadcasting in Britain, Kenneth Wolfe writes of The Man Born to Be King, \"That it was the most astonishing and far-reaching innovation in all religious broadcasting so far is beyond dispute\".[150]\\nSayers\\'s 1949 translation of Dante\\'s Hell was a best-seller: its first print run of 50,000 quickly sold out.[113] Cantica 2 of the Divine Comedy, Purgatory, was published in 1955, but when Sayers died her version of the final Cantica, Heaven, was only two-thirds complete. Reynolds finished the translation and it was published in 1962.[151][152] The three volumes of the Sayers translation sold 1.25 million copies by 1999.[113] Writing in 1989 Reynolds noted that because of Sayers\\'s translations, Dante has been read by \"more English-speaking readers in the last forty years than he had in the preceding six and a quarter centuries\".[153]\\nFor her translation Sayers chose to use modern colloquial English,[154] and as she described, \"to eschew \\'Marry, quotha!\\' without declining upon \\'Sez you!\\'\".[155] Where she differed from this was in Purgatory, where Dante used the dialect of Provence for the words of the southern French poet Arnaut Daniel: Sayers instead used a Southern Scots dialect and explained it was \"a dialect which bears something of the same relation to English as Provençal does to Italian\".[156] Sayers\\'s biographer Mary Brian Durkin observes that \"many find her translation of the passage jarring and distracting\", while Durkin thinks it \"forced\\xa0... almost doggerel\".[157]\\nSayers retained Dante\\'s terza rima structure—three-line stanzas linked by their rhyme scheme—a difficult form to use in English translations, given the fewer rhyme endings when compared with Italian.[158] The theological academic Mary Prentice Barrows considers that when the form is used in English translations of Dante, including those by Sayers, \"the necessity of fitting the exact sense into triple rhymes inevitably forces distorted syntax and strange choices of words, so that the limpidity—the characteristic beauty of the original—is lost\".[159] Thomas G. Bergin, a scholar of Italian literature who had also translated The Divine Comedy, thought that Sayers\\'s translation has \"the directness of Dante in tone, and the very technique of Dante in execution. And indeed the merits of Miss Sayers\\' version are great.\"[160] Although, he noted, the limitations of the form meant some of Sayers\\'s rhymes were forced.[160] The critic Dudley Fitts criticised Sayers\\'s use of terza rima in English, and her use of some archaisms for the sake of rhyme which \"are so nearly pervasive that they reduce the impact of a work generously conceived and lovingly elaborated\".[161] In the introduction to Purgatory, Sayers advised readers to\\nReynolds considers Sayers was well placed to deal with Dante\\'s rhyming structure. She had been interested in translating poetry from her schooldays and had enjoyed writing her own early verses. Her first works of poetry, according to Reynolds, contain \"a masterly and beautiful example of a lay, a series of poems linked to a complex structure\".[163] Fitts considers her \"not\\xa0... an accomplished poet; but she does handle verse intelligently\".[161] With each of the Dante translations, Sayers included detailed introductions to explain her word choices and to provide alternative translations. Notes were included on each canto to explain the allegories and symbology; the writer Anne Perry considers these \"acutely satisfying and thought provoking and infinitely enriching the work\".[164] Sayers also provided an outline on Dante\\'s life and personality, \"without which\", in Perry\\'s view, \"the whole work would be robbed of much of its meaning\".[165]\\nSayers\\'s novels have been criticised for racism, particularly antisemitism. Philip L. Scowcroft, in a study of her approach to race, cites examples from Unnatural Death such as \"\\'God bless my soul\\', said Sir Charles horrified, \\'an English girl in the hands of a nigger. How abominable\"; \"Nigger taste runs rather to boots and hair oil\"; and \"The second man\\xa0... seemed to wear the long-toed boots affected by Jew boys of the louder sort.\"[166] Scowcroft also highlights the stereotypical descriptions physical of Jewish characters in Whose Body?, and the description of Jewish lifestyle by Wimsey\\'s mother:\\nThe writer Nancy-Lou Patterson observes that while Sayers reflected the prejudices of her time, the casual manner in which the racism is used is unpleasant, although, she notes, in none of her novels does Sayers make the villain or murderer Jewish.[166] Brabazon, reflecting on the criticism against her generally, wrote:\\nScowcroft concludes his examination by saying that although Sayers showed some elements of contemporary attitudes, \"the much stronger evidence of her Jewish and foreign characters as they unfold in her books suggest that in the matter of \\'racial prejudice\\',\\xa0... [that] she and Lord Peter were more enlightened than the average.\"[169] When Sayers was asked by her publisher if the French translation could tone down some of the references to Jewish characteristics and attributes, she replied \"Certainly they can soften the thrusts against the Jews if they like and if there are any. My own opinion is that the only people who were presented in a favourable light were the Jews!\"[170]\\nB. J. Rahn, an academic who specialises in detective fiction, believes Sayers was the first writer to use a whodunit to include feminist topics in her work.[171] This includes the character of Harriet Vane, who is portrayed as a strong, independent woman. She has her own career, is strong enough to have a co-habiting relationship in an age when it was socially unacceptable and was nearly an equal to Wimsey as a detective.[172][173] Vane takes a leading part in Sayers\\'s penultimate novel, Gaudy Night, which is a whodunit without a murder.[174] Anna Bogen, in her examination of the novel as a work of middlebrow fiction, views the work \"positively in terms of both literary quality and feminist politics\", calling it \"a pioneering defense of women\\'s education\".[175] The literary critic Melissa Schaub sees Vane as \"a feminist model for everyday readers\"[176] Sandberg considers the introduction of Vane as \"a watershed moment in Sayers\\'s career as a detective writer\" as it signalled the change towards her new literary form of detective novel.[177] He sees Vane as \"a literary self-portrait of Sayers\",[178] being financially independent, a career woman and one who eschewed the patriarchal expectations of inter-war Britain. In cohabiting with a lover and rejecting a marriage proposal from him and then initially rejecting marriage to Wimsey before accepting him, there is a display of Sayers\\'s view of the basis of marriage: one that is \"equal, intellectual, passionate, amusing, challenging\", according to Sayers\\'s biographer, Catherine Kenny.[179]\\nThe literary critic Laurel Young considers that Sayers was a feminist, as not only did she have strong female characters within her works, but also led an independent and seemingly non-conformist life.[180] Sayers did not consider herself as such, and in a 1938 address, she said:\\nSayers published no autobiographical work, and told her literary executor, Muriel St Clare Byrne, that she wanted no biography of her to be written until fifty years after her death.[182] This wish was not legally enforceable, and several biographies and literary studies of Sayers were published in the 1970s, including Dorothy L. Sayers: A Bio-Bibliography by Leslie H. Romer (1975),[183] Such A Strange Lady: An Introduction to Dorothy L. Sayers by Janet Hitchman (1975),[184] Maker and Craftsman: The Story of Dorothy L. Sayers by Alzina Dale (1978),[185]  and Dorothy L. Sayers: A Literary Biography by Ralph E. Hone (1979).[186] Such books were written without access to Sayers\\'s personal papers, which included a large archive of correspondence, an unpublished memoir of her early years and an unfinished autobiographical novel. Byrne and Anthony Fleming, Sayers\\'s son, concluded around 1980 that the accounts thus far published were \"incomplete or inaccurate or both\" and that, despite Sayers\\'s wish for a fifty-year moratorium, an authoritative biography should be written \"which incorporated the available facts, before those who knew her had died and the records had been scattered\".[182]\\nAt the request of Byrne and Fleming, the author James Brabazon, a friend of Sayers, wrote an authorised biography, aiming to give a full and accurate account of Sayers\\'s life.[187] It was published as Dorothy L. Sayers: The Life of a Courageous Woman in 1981, with a preface by Fleming and a foreword by P. D. James.[188] Among later full-length biographies is  Dorothy L. Sayers: Her Life And Soul by Barbara Reynolds, the then chairman of the Dorothy L. Sayers Society, published in 1993, marking the centenary of the subject\\'s birth.[189] Like Brabazon, Reynolds had been a friend of Sayers; the literary critic of The Times commented that her book \"delivers a far warmer and more humane Sayers than previous biographers\\xa0... Where Ralph Hone and James Brabazon attempted to dig Sayers out of the social psychology of late Victorian England\\xa0... Reynolds allows her to speak in her own voice\".[190] In 2020 Colin Duriez published a further biography of Sayers,[191] interspersing the factual material with imagined dramatised scenes and conversations.[192]\\nSome studies of Sayers\\'s works include biographical sections; among them are Dorothy L. Sayers by Mary Brian Durkin (1980),[193] Dorothy L. Sayers, A Pilgrim Soul by Nancy Tischler (1980),[194] and The Remarkable Case of Dorothy L. Sayers by Catherine Kenney (1990).[195] Kenney is also the author of the article on Sayers in the ODNB, which replaced an earlier one by J. I. M. Stewart.[3][35] Various aspects of Sayers\\'s relationships and career have been examined in Dorothy and Jack: The Transforming Friendship of Dorothy L. Sayers and C. S. Lewis by Gina Dalfonzo and Subversive: Christ, Culture and the Shocking Dorothy L. Sayers by Crystal Downing (both 2020).[196]\\nUnder the aegis of the Dorothy L. Sayers Society, Reynolds collected and edited Sayers\\'s letters, written between 1889 and 1957 and published in five volumes between 1995 and 2002. The final volume includes the texts of Sayers\\'s autobiographical fragment and unfinished autobiographical novel first used by Brabazon in his 1982 biography.[197]\\nFrom the outset, Sayers aimed to develop the detective novel from the pure puzzle into a less artificial style, comparable with non-crime fiction of the period. A later writer of crime novels, P. D. James, writes that Sayers \"did as much as any writer in the genre to develop the detective story from an ingenious but lifeless puzzle into an intellectually respectable branch of fiction with serious claims to be judged as a novel\".[198] As a reviewer Sayers wrote of one book by a now neglected writer, A. E. Fielding, \"The plot is extremely intricate and full of red herrings, and the solution is kept a dark secret up to the last moment. The weakness\\xa0... is that the people never really come alive.\"[199] She admired Agatha Christie, but in her own works Sayers moved away to some extent from the traditional whodunit towards what has been dubbed the \"howdunit\": \"There is still an idea going about that the \\'Who?\\' book is the only legitimate variety of the species. Yet, if we demand any sort of likeness to real life, the \\'How?\\' book is much nearer to the facts\".[199] James notes that Sayers nonetheless wrote within the \"Golden Age\" conventions,[n 13] with a central mystery, a closed circle of suspects and a solution that the reader can work out by logical deduction from clues \"planted with deceptive cunning but essential fairness\\xa0... Those were not the days of the swift bash to the skull followed by 60,000 words of psychological insight\".[198]\\nSome of Sayers\\'s stories have been filmed for the cinema and television. Robert Montgomery and Constance Cummings played Wimsey and Harriet Vane in a 1940 film adaptation of Busman\\'s Honeymoon, and for BBC television Ian Carmichael played Wimsey in serial adaptations of six of the novels (none of them featuring Vane), broadcast between 1972 and 1975. Edward Petherbridge played Wimsey and Harriet Walter played Vane in television versions of Strong Poison, Have His Carcase and Gaudy Night in 1987.[201] On BBC radio, in numerous adaptations of Sayers\\'s detective stories, Wimsey has been played by more than a dozen actors, including Rex Harrison, Hugh Burden, Alan Wheatley, Ian Carmichael and Gary Bond.[202] New productions of The Man Born to Be King were broadcast in every decade from the 1940s to the 1970s, and the cycle was repeated in the first and second decades of the 21st century.[203]\\nIn 1998, at the invitation of Sayers\\'s estate, Jill Paton Walsh published a completion of an unfinished Wimsey novel,  Thrones, Dominations, which Sayers began in 1936 but abandoned after six chapters.[204] It was well received—The Times found it \"miraculously right\" with \"a thrilling denouement\"[205]—and Paton Walsh wrote three more Wimsey novels. A Presumption of Death (2002) incorporated extracts from The Wimsey Papers published by Sayers in 1939 and 1940.[206] The Attenbury Emeralds (2010) was based on Wimsey\\'s first case, referred to in a number of Sayers\\'s novels; in The Times, Marcel Berlins said that Sayers would not have recognised that the book was not her own work.[207] In The Late Scholar (2013), Peter and Harriet, now Duke and Duchess of Denver,[n 14] return to Shrewsbury College, Oxford, Harriet\\'s alma mater.[209]\\nIn 1973 the minor planet 3627 Sayers was named after her. The asteroid was discovered by Luboš Kohoutek, but the name was suggested by the astronomer Brian G. Marsden, with whom Sayers consulted extensively during the last year of her life, in her attempt to rehabilitate the Roman poet Lucan.[210][211][n 15] Sayers has a feast day on 17 December in the American Episcopal Church liturgical calendar, given because of her work as a Christian apologist and spiritual writer.[213][214] In 2000 English Heritage installed a blue plaque at 24 Great James Street, Bloomsbury, where Sayers lived between 1921 and 1929.[215] The Dorothy L. Sayers Society was founded in 1976 and, as at 2023, continues in its mission \"to promote the study of the life, works and thoughts of this great scholar and writer, to encourage the performance of her plays and the publication of books by and about her, to preserve original material for posterity and to provide assistance for researchers\".[216][217]\\n',\n",

Born in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan.\\nSoji Shimada graduated from Seishikan High School in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima Prefecture, and later Musashino Art University as a Commercial arts design major.[1]\\nAfter spending years as a dump truck driver, free writer, and musician, he made his debut as a mystery writer in 1981 when The Tokyo Zodiac Murders was shortlisted for the Edogawa Rampo Prize.[2]\\nHis most well-known works in Japan include the Detective Mitarai Series and the Detective Yoshiki Series.[2] His works often involve themes such as the death penalty, Nihonjinron (his theory on the Japanese people), and Japanese and international culture.[citation needed] He is a strong supporter of amateur Honkaku (i.e. authentic, orthodox) mystery writers.[citation needed] Following the trend of Social School of crime fiction led by Seicho Matsumoto, he was the pioneer of \"Shin-Honkaku\" (New Orthodox) logic mystery genre.[3] He bred authors such as Yukito Ayatsuji, Rintaro Norizuki and Shogo Utano, and he led the mystery boom from the late 1980s to present day. As the father of \"Shin-Honkaku,\" Shimada is sometimes referred to as \"The Godfather of Shin-Honkaku\" or \"God of Mystery.”[4]\\nHis humor mysteries such as Soseki and the London Mummy Murders and Let There Be Murder, Any Kind of Murder involve an extravagant mystery trick as well as elements of satire, confusion, youth, and survival.\\nIn recent years, he has begun a new challenge—an animated series called the \"Taiga Novels,\" collaborated with the renowned illustrator Masamune Shirow.

       " '\\nGeorges Joseph Christian Simenon (French: [ʒɔʁʒ simnɔ̃]; 12/13 February 1903 – 4 September 1989) was a Belgian writer, most famous for his fictional detective Jules Maigret. One of the most popular authors of the 20th century, he published around 400 novels, 21 volumes of memoirs and many short stories, selling over 500 million copies.\\nApart from his detective fiction, he achieved critical acclaim for his literary novels which he called romans durs (hard novels). Among his literary admirers were Max Jacob, François Mauriac and André Gide. Gide wrote, “I consider Simenon a great novelist, perhaps the greatest, and the most genuine novelist that we have had in contemporary French literature.”[1]\\nBorn and raised in Liège, Belgium, Simenon lived for extended periods in France (1922–45), the United States (1946–55) and finally Switzerland (1957-1989). Much of his work is semi-autobiographical, inspired by his childhood and youth in Liège, extensive travels in Europe and the world, wartime experiences, troubled marriages, and numerous love affairs.\\nCritics such as John Banville have praised Simenon\\'s novels for their psychological insights and vivid evocation of time and place. Among his most notable works are The Saint-Fiacre Affair (1932), Monsieur Hire\\'s Engagement (1933), Act of Passion (1947), The Snow was Dirty (1948) and The Cat (1967).\\nSimenon was born at 26 Rue Léopold (Liège)\\xa0[fr] (now number 24) to Désiré Simenon and his wife Henriette Brüll. Désiré Simenon worked in an accounting office at an insurance company and had married Henriette in April 1902. Simenon was either born at 11.30 pm on Thursday 12 February 1903 (according to the birth certificate), or just after midnight on Friday 13th (the date possibly being falsified on the certificate due to superstition).[2]\\nThe Simenon family was of Walloon and Flemish ancestry, settling in the Belgian Limburg in the seventeenth century.[3] His mother\\'s family was of Flemish, Dutch and German descent. One of his mother\\'s most notorious ancestors was Gabriel Brühl, a criminal who preyed on Limburg from the 1720s until he was hanged in 1743.[3] Later, Simenon would use Brühl as one of his many pen names.[4]\\nIn April 1905, two years after Simenon\\'s birth, the family moved to 3 rue Pasteur (now 25 rue Georges Simenon) in Liège\\'s Outremeuse\\xa0[fr] neighbourhood. Simenon\\'s brother Christian was born in September 1906 and eventually became their mother\\'s favourite child, which Simenon resented.[5] The young Simenon, however, idolised his father and later claimed to have partly modelled Maigret\\'s temperament on him.[6]\\nAt the age of three, Simenon learned to read at the Ecole Guardienne run by the Sisters of Notre Dame. Then, between 1908 and 1914, he attended the Institut Saint-André, run by the Christian Brothers.[7]\\nIn 1911, the Simenons moved to 53 rue de la Loi, where they took in lodgers, many of them students from Eastern Europe, Jews and political refugees.[8] This gave the young Simenon an introduction to the wider world, which was later reflected his novels, notably Pedigree (published 1948) and Le Locataire (The Lodger) (1938).\\nFollowing the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Liège was occupied by the German army. Henriette took in German officers as lodgers, much to Désiré\\'s disapproval. Simenon later said that the war years provided some of the happiest times of his life. They were also memorable for a child because, \"my father cheated, my mother cheated, everyone cheated.\"[9]\\nIn October 1914, Simenon began his studies at the Collège Saint-Louis, a Jesuit high school. After a year, he switched to Collège St Servais, where he studied for three years. He excelled at French, but his marks in other subjects declined. He read widely in the Russian, French and English classics, frequently played truant, and turned to petty theft in order to buy pastries and other war time luxuries.[10]\\nIn 1917, the Simenon family moved to a former post office building in the rue des Maraîchers.[11] Using his father\\'s heart condition as a pretext, Simenon quit school in June 1918, without taking his end-of-year exams.[12] After brief periods working in a patisserie and a bookshop, Simenon found himself unemployed when the war ended in November 1918. He witnessed scenes of violent retribution against residents of Liège accused of collaboration which stayed with him for the rest of his life. He described these scenes in Pedigree and Les trois crimes de mes amis (My Friends\\' Three Crimes) (1938).[13]\\nIn January 1919, the 15-year-old Simenon took a job as a junior reporter at the Gazette de Liège, a right-wing Catholic newspaper edited by Joseph Demarteau.[14] Within a few months he was promoted to crime reporting, signing his articles \"Georges Sim\". By April he was given his own opinion and gossip column which he signed \"Monsieur Le Coq.\" He was also assigned interviews with leading international figures such as Hirohito, Crown Prince of Japan, and French war hero Marshal Foch. In 1920-21 he enrolled in a course on forensic science at the University of Liège in order to improve his knowledge of the latest police methods.[15]\\nIn May 1920, Simenon began publishing short fiction in the Gazette. In September he completed his first novel, Au Pont des Arches which he self-published in 1921.[16] He wrote two other novels while working at the Gazette, but these were never published.[17]\\nIn June 1919, Simenon had been introduced into a group of young artists and bohemians which called itself \"Le Caque\" (herring barrel). The group met at night to drink, discuss art and philosophy, and experiment with drugs such as morphine and cocaine. In early 1922 one of the members of the group, Joseph Kleine, hanged himself at the doors of the St Pholien church of Liège after a night of excess with Le Caque. Simenon was one of the last people to see Kleine alive and was deeply affected by his suicide, later referring to the incident in Les trois crimes de mes amis and Le pendu de St Pholien (The Hanged Man of Saint Pholien) (1931).[18]\\nThrough Le Caque, Simenon met a young painter, Régine Renchon, and in early 1921 they began a relationship. They soon became engaged and agreed that Simenon should complete his year of compulsory military service before they married.[19]\\nSimenon\\'s father died In November 1921, an event which Simenon called, \"the most important day in a man\\'s life.\" Soon after, he began his military service. After a brief posting with the allied occupation forces in Germany, he was transferred to the cavalry barracks in Liège and was soon given permission to resume writing for the Gazette.[20]\\nWhen Simenon\\'s military service ended in December 1922, he resigned from the Gazette and moved to Paris to establish a base for himself and his future wife Régine, whom he preferred to call \"Tigy\".[21]\\nNow in Paris, Simenon found a menial job with a far-right political group headed by the writer Binet-Valmer. In March 1923, he returned to Liège to marry Régine. Although neither Simenon or Régine were religious, they were married in a Catholic church to please Simenon\\'s mother, who was devout.[22]\\nThe newly-weds moved to Paris where Régine tried to establish herself as a painter while Simenon resumed work for Binet-Valmer and sent articles to the Revue Sincère of Brussels for which he was the Paris correspondent. He also wrote short stories for popular magazines, but sales were sporadic.[23]\\nIn the summer of 1923, Simenon was engaged by the Marquis de Tracy as his private secretary, which obliged him to spend nine months of the year at the aristocrat\\'s various rural properties. Régine soon moved to a village near the Marquis\\'s principal estate at Paray-le-Frésil, near Moulins.[24]\\nWhile working for the Marquis, Simenon began submitting stories to Le Matin whose literary editor was Colette. Colette advised him to make his work \"less literary\" which Simenon took to mean that he should use simple descriptions and a limited stock of common words. Simenon followed her advice and within a year became one of the paper\\'s regular contributors.[25]\\nNow with a steady income from his writing, Simenon left the Marquis\\' employ in 1924 and returned to Paris where he and Régine found an apartment in the fashionable Place des Vosges. Simenon was writing and selling short stories at the rate of 80 typed pages a day, and now turned his hand to pulp novels. His first, Le roman d\\'une dactylo (The Story of a Typist) was quickly sold and two more appeared in 1924 under the pseudonyms \"Jean du Perry\" and \"Georges Simm\".[26] From 1921 to 1934 he used a total of 17 pen names while writing 358 novels and short stories.[27]\\nIn the summer of 1925, the Simenons took a holiday in Normandy where they met Henriette Liberge, the 18-year-old daughter of a fisherman. Régine offered her a job as their housekeeper in Paris and the young woman accepted. Simenon began calling her \"Boule\", and she was to become his lover and part of the Simenon household under that name for the next 39 years.[28]\\nSimenon began an affair with Josephine Baker in 1926 or 1927, and became her part-time assistant and editor of Josephine Baker\\'s Magazine.[29] However, the Simenons were tiring of their hectic life in Paris, and in April 1928 they set out with Boule for a six-month tour of the rivers and canals of France in a small boat, the Ginette. Without the distractions provided by Josephine Baker, Simenon\\'s tally of published popular novels increased from 11 in 1927 to 44 in 1928.[30]\\n\\nIn the spring of 1929, the Simenons and Boule set off for a tour of northern France, Belgium and Holland in a larger, custom-built boat, the Ostrogoth. Simenon had begun contributing detective stories to a new magazine called Détective and continued to publish popular novels, mainly with the publishers Fayard.[31]During his northern tour, Simenon wrote three popular novels featuring a police inspector named Maigret, but only one, Train de nuit (Night Train) was accepted by Fayard. Simenon began working on the latter novel (or possibly its successor Pietr-le-Letton (Pietr the Latvian)) in September 1929 when the Ostrogoth was undergoing repairs in the Dutch city of Delfzijl, and the city is now celebrated as the birthplace of Simenon\\'s most famous character.[32][33]\\nOn his return to Paris in April 1930, Simenon completed Pietr-le-Letton, the first novel in which commissioner Maigret of the Paris mobile crime brigade was a fully developed character. The novel was serialised in Fayard\\'s magazine Ric et Rac later that year, and was the first fictional work to appear under Simenon\\'s real name.[34][33]\\nThe first Maigret novels were launched in book form by Fayard in February 1931 at the fancy dress bal anthropométrique  which had a police and criminals theme. The launching party was widely reported and the novels received positive reviews. Simenon wrote 19 Maigret novels by the end of 1933, and the series eventually sold 500 million copies.[35]\\nIn April 1932, the Simenons and Boule moved to La Rochelle in south-west France. Soon after, they left for Africa where Simenon visited his brother, who was a colonial administrator in the Belgian Congo. Simenon also visited other African colonies and wrote a series of articles highly critical of colonialism. He drew on his African experience in novels such as Le Coup de Lune (Tropic Moon) (1933) and 450 à l\\'ombre (Aboard the Aquitaine) (1936).[36]\\nIn 1933, the Simenons visited Germany and Eastern Europe, and Simenon secured an interview with Leon Trotsky in exile in Turkey for Paris-Soir. On his return, he announced that he would write no more Maigret novels, and signed a contract with the prestigious publisher Gallimard for his new work.[37]\\nMaigret, written in June 1933, was intended to be the last of the series and ended with the detective in retirement. Simenon called the Maigret novels \"semi-literary\" and he wanted to establish himself as a serious writer. He stated his aim was to win the Nobel Prize for Literature by 1947.[38]\\nSimenon\\'s notable novels of the 1930s, written after the temporary retirement of Maigret, include Le testament Donadieu (The Shadow Falls) (1937), L\\'homme qui regardait passer les trains (The Man who Watched the Trains Go By) (1938) and Le bourgmestre de Furnes (The Burgomaster of Furnes) (1939).[39] André Gide and François Mauriac were among Simenon\\'s greatest literary admirers at the time.[40]\\nIn 1935, the Simenons undertook a world tour which included the Americas, the Galapagos Islands, Tahiti, Australia and India.[41] They then moved back to Paris, in the fashionable Neuilly district, where they lived a life of luxury which Simenon later described as \"too sumptuous\".[42]\\nThey moved home to La Rochelle in 1938 because, as Simenon later explained, \"I was sickened by the life I was leading.\" In April the following year, Simenon\\'s first child, Marc, was born.[43]\\nSimenon was in a café in La Rochelle when France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939.[43] In May 1940, Germany invaded Belgium, and La Rochelle became the reception centre for Belgian refugees. The Belgian government appointed Simenon Commissioner for Refugees, and he organised the reception, accommodation, and food and health needs for some 55,000 war refugees before the armistice of 22 June. By August, all Belgian refugees had been repatriated and Simenon resumed civilian life in his new home at Fontenay-le-Compte in the Vendée.[44]\\nLater in 1940, a local doctor examined Simenon and diagnosed a serious heart illness, advising him to cut back on his favourite pastimes of pipe smoking, excessive eating, alcohol, and sex. Simenon began working on his memoirs Je me souviens (I remember), intended as a letter to his son from a father who would soon be dead.  A second medical opinion was later sought, and Simenon was assured his heart was sound.[45]\\nSimenon returned to writing Maigret stories and novels, completing two in 1940 and three in 1941. He also wrote longer novels such as Pedigree, a fictionalised reworking of Je me souviens. As a popular, non-Jewish author who avoided war themes and anti-German sentiments, Simenon had few problems in having his works published at a time of censorship and paper restrictions.[46]\\nAmong his major works written during the war years are La veuve Couderc (The Widow Couderc) (1942), Le fuite de M. Monde (Monsieur Monde Vanishes) (published 1945), and Pedigree (published 1948).[47] Simenon also conducted correspondence, most notably with André Gide. Gide considered La veuve Couderc superior to Camus\\' The Stranger which was published around the same time and has a similar main character and themes.[48][49]\\nDuring the war, Simenon sold the film rights to five of his novels to Continental Films, which was funded by the German government and banned the participation of Jews. The Continental production of Simenon\\'s Les inconnus dans la maison (Strangers in the House) had exaggerated anti-Semitic themes which are not in the novel. Resistance underground newspapers began attacking Continental Films and anyone who took their money.[50]\\nIn 1942, the French Commissariat-Géneral aux Questions Juives notified Simenon that they suspected him of being Jewish and gave him one month to prove he wasn\\'t. Simenon was able to obtain the necessary certificates of birth and baptism through his mother, and soon after the Simenons moved to a more remote village in the Vendée.[51]\\nIn 1944, Régine discovered Simenon\\'s long-term affair with Boule, and Simenon also confessed to his numerous other affairs. The couple agreed to remain married for the sake of their child, but to give each other their sexual freedom.[52]\\nIn November 1944, following the German retreat, Simenon, Marc and Boule moved to a hotel in the resort town of Les Sable d\\'Olonne, while Régine returned to their house near La Rochelle which had now been evacuated by the Germans. In January 1945, Simenon was placed under house arrest by the police and the French Forces of the Interior on suspicion of collaboration. After three months of investigations, he was cleared of all charges.[53]\\nSimenon went to Paris in May 1945 while Marc and Boule returned to their house near La Rochelle with Régine. Simenon, possibly out of concern that the French Communist Party might take over France, had decided to move to America. The rest of the family soon joined him in Paris and Simenon used his contacts to secure the required travel documents for America. Régine, however, refused to travel to America with Marc unless Boule stayed behind in France. Simenon reluctantly agreed to Régine\\'s demand.[54]\\nThe Simenons arrived in New York in October 1945 and soon moved to Canada, where they set up home at Ste-Marguerite du Lac Masson, north of Montreal.[55] In November, Simenon met Denyse Ouimet, a 25-year-old French-Canadian, with whom he started an affair and hired as his secretary. Denyse moved into the Simenon home in January 1946,[56] and several weeks later told Régine that she was his new lover.[57] Simenon fictionalised his affair with Denyse in his novels Trois chambres à Manhattan (Three Bedrooms in Manhattan) (1947) and Lettre à mon juge (Act of Passion) (1947).[56]\\nThe Simenons and Denyse drove to Florida in the summer of 1946, and then visited Cuba in order to arrange for permanent residence visas for the United States. It was in Florida that Simenon wrote Lettre à mon juge, widely considered one of his major works.[58]\\nIn June 1947, the Simenons moved to Arizona. Boule joined them there in 1948, after Régine dropped her objections to Simenon\\'s desire to have a wife and two lovers in his household. Simenon continued to write quickly, working from 6 am to 9 am daily, and averaging 4,500 words a day. While in Arizona, Simenon wrote two Maigret novels and several romans durs (hard novels) including La neige était sale (The Snow Was Dirty) (1948), one of his major works.[59] The 1951 American paperback edition of this novel sold 2 million copies.[60]\\nDenyse became pregnant in early 1949, and Simenon asked Régine for a divorce. Denyse gave birth to Jean Dennis Chrétien Simenon (known as John) on 29 September.[61] Régine had moved to California with Marc and Boule, and Simenon, Denyse and the baby soon moved to Carmel-by-the-Sea where they would be close to Marc. The divorce was granted in Nevada on 21 June 1950. Simenon married Denyse the following day.[62]\\nThe newly-weds moved to Lakeville, Connecticut  and also rented a house in nearby Salmon Creek for Régine, Marc and Boule. In the five years he lived in Connecticut, Simenon wrote 13 Maigret novels and 14 romans durs including the major works La mort de Belle (Belle) (1952) and L\\'horloger d\\'Everton (The Watchmaker of Everton) (1954).[63]\\nWhile living in Connecticut, Simenon\\'s book sales increased to an estimated 3 million a year, and he was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America. Simenon and Denyse made two trips to Europe, in 1952 and 1954. On the 1952 trip, Simenon was admitted to the Royal Belgian Academy.[64] In February 1953, Denyse gave birth to a daughter, Marie-Georges Simenon (known as Marie-Jo).[65] By this time, Boule had moved in with Denyse and Simenon and had resumed her position as his lover.[66]\\nBy 1955, Simenon had become disillusioned with America and concerned that Denyse, who wanted to live in Europe, was becoming more distant from him. In March, Simenon, Denyse and Boule left for a European holiday and were never to return to live in America.[67]\\nThe Simenons took up residence in France at Mougins, near Cannes, while Régine and Marc lived in a hotel nearby. Simenon wrote two Maigret novels and two romans durs during his first six months on the French Riviera, but was still searching for a permanent home. In July 1957, the Simenons and Boule moved to the Château d\\'Echandens near Lausanne, Switzerland, and were to remain there for seven years.[68]\\nIn May 1959, Denyse gave birth to a son, Pierre, who soon became seriously ill but survived a difficult first year.[69] In December 1961, Simenon and Denyse employed Teresa Sburelin, a young Italian woman, as a maid. Teresa soon became Simenon\\'s lover and was to remain his companion for the rest of his life.[70]\\nSimenon continued to produce novels at a rate of three to five a year at Enchandens, including two of his most notable, Le président (The Premier) (1958) and Les anneaux de Bicêtre (The Patient) (1963).[71]\\nHowever, the relationship between Denyse and Simenon was deteriorating. They were both drinking heavily[72] and Simenon admitted that he had hit her.[73] In June 1962, Denyse was persuaded to admit herself to a mental health clinic for several months.[74] In 1961 the Simenons had decided to build a new house at Epalinges in the heights above Lausanne. The house was completed in December 1963, but Denyse lived there for only a few months before returning to the clinic.[75]\\nDenyse left Epalinges for the last time in April 1964. In November, Simenon dismissed Boule who went to live with Marc who was now married with children.[76]\\nAlthough Simenon never divorced Denyse, he was now living with his companion Teresa and three of his children: John, Marie-Jo, and Pierre. He continued to work steadily, completing three to four books a year from 1965 to 1971, including the important works Le petit saint (The Little Saint) (1965) and Le chat (The Cat) (1967).[77]\\nIn February 1973, Simenon announced that he was retiring from writing. A few months later, he and Teresa moved into a small house in Lausanne. He produced no new fiction from that date, but he dictated 21 volumes of memoirs.[78]\\nIn May 1978, Simenon\\'s daughter, Marie-Jo, killed herself in Paris at the age of 25. In his final volume of memoirs, Mémoires intimes (Intimate memoirs) (1981), he wrote, \"One never recovers from the loss of a daughter one has cherished. It leaves a void that nothing can fill.\"[79]\\nSimenon underwent a brain operation in 1984, but made a full recovery. From late 1988 he was confined to a wheelchair. He died on 4 September 1989, following a fall.[80]\\nSimenon\\'s published works include 192 novels written under his own name,[81] over 200 novels written under various pseudonyms, four autobiographies and 21 volumes of memoirs.[82] He also wrote a large quantity of short fiction. His novels had sold over 500 million copies by the time of his death, making him one of the highest selling novelists in history.[82]\\nSimenon\\'s fiction is often classified into his early pseudonymous popular novels, the last of which was written in 1933;[83] his fiction featuring police commissioner Jules Maigret (75 novels and 28 short stories);[81] and his 117 literary novels which he called romans durs (\"hard novels\").[84]\\nThe first Maigret novel published under Simenon\\'s name was Pietr-le-Letton (Pietr the Latvian) which was serialised in 1930. The last Maigret novel was Maigret et M. Charles (Maigret and Monsieur Charles) published in 1972.[85]\\n\\nThe early Maigret novels generally received positive reviews and were acknowledged as an attempt to raise the standard of the French crime novel. Several critics, however, made fun of the speed with which they were written. Le Canard Enchaîné told its readers, \"Monsieur Georges Simenon makes his living by killing someone every month and then discovering the murderer.\"[86]The Maigret stories are characterised by their short length, simple writing style and a deliberately restricted vocabulary (which Simenon estimated was limited to 2000 words). Simenon stated that his Maigret novels were designed to be read by people of average education in a single sitting.[87][88]\\nPatrick Marnham, Scott Bradfield and others state that the early Maigrets were innovative because the detective doesn\\'t hunt for clues or use deduction to find the guilty party, but rather immerses himself in the life and environment of the victim and suspected criminal. In most cases, Maigret seeks to understand the criminal rather than judge him.[89][90][91]\\nSimenon stated that his Maigret stories often deal with more serious themes that those of his other novels.[92] Recurrent themes include political influence over the justice system, snobbery and class divisions, and the role of social background and pure chance in determining whether an individual becomes a criminal or a respected member of society.[93]\\nMarnham, Fenton Besler and others have pointed out that the plots of the Maigret novels are often implausible and internally inconsistent.[94][95] However, critics have praised Simenon\\'s ability to concisely evoke the atmosphere of a particular place and to provide insights into human psychology.[96] Referring to The Saint-Fiacre Affair, John Banville wrote, \"The story is silly, as usual, but the evocation of the little town and its people makes such considerations irrelevant.\"[97]\\nSimenon suspended his writing of Maigret stories in 1933 in order to concentrate on the literary novels he called romans durs. In 1937 he stated that his aim was to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1947.[98]\\nSimenon defined the novel as, \"a passion which completely possesses and enslaves the writer and permits him to exorcise his demons by giving them form and casting them out into the world.\"[99] His novels were about \"the naked man, the one who looks at himself in the mirror while shaving and has no illusions about himself.\"[99]\\nMichel Lemoine has elaborated on this, stating, \"There is hardly a character in all the Simenon canon who does not ask, \\'Who am I? What have I done with my life?\"[100]Biographer Fenton Besler described the roman durs as \"psychological thrillers...in which he explores the darkest corners of the human mind and, in tautly written prose, creates an atmosphere which is sinister and entirely his own.\"[101] According to Besler, it doesn\\'t matter whether Simenon\\'s novels are set in France, Africa, Tahiti or America, the characters live the same traumas and despair, only \"with their problems and anxieties accentuated by the local setting.\"[102]\\nBiographer Patrick Marnham states that Simenon\\'s earliest romans durs contain many of Simenon\\'s typical themes: the street life of Paris, prostitution, the drudgery of domestic servants and shop assistants, police corruption and the hope of escape represented by railway stations. He compares Simenon\\'s preoccupation with the \"little people\" with that of Balzac.[103] According to Marnham, there is also a strong autobiographical strain in his fiction, where events which Simenon had experienced were lightly fictionalised and then taken to a social, criminal or psychological extreme.[104]\\nSimenon\\'s romans durs soon gained a high reputation among other writers, with Max Jacob, François Mauriac and André Gide among his admirers.[105] Nevertheless, the academic and critical reception of his novels in France and the United States was mixed, which Ralph Ingersoll, Brendan Gill and Gilbert Sigaux have attributed to suspicion about their popularity and the speed with which they were written.[106]\\nSimenon\\'s most acclaimed novels include Monsieur Hire\\'s Engagement (1933),[107] The Man who Watched the Trains Go By (1938),[108] Monsieur Monde Vanishes (1945),[109] Act of Passion (1947),[110] The Snow was Dirty (1948),[111] Red Lights (1953),[112] and The Little Saint (1967).[107]\\nIn 2003, the collection La Pléiade published 21 of Simenon\\'s novels in two volumes. The novels were selected by Professor Jacques Dubois, President of the Centre for Georges Simenon Studies at the Université de Liège, and his assistant Benoît Denis, both experts on Simenon.[117] A third volume of 8 novels and two autobiographical works was published in 2009.[118]\\nThe following works were selected for inclusion in the Pléiade editions of the works of Georges Simenon. The French title and year of first publication in France is given first, followed by the titles of major English translations published in book form. Unless otherwise specified, the sources for the French title and publication date are Bernard Alavoine,[119] Trudee Young,[120] Tout Simenon[121] and Tout Maigret.[122] The sources for the titles of English translations are Trudee Young,[120]  Barry Forshaw,[123] Patrick Marnham[124] and Penguin UK.[125]\\nSimenon\\'s work has been widely adapted to cinema and television.

He has since become known as a fiction writer, with sales in English exceeding 40 million by 2010 and translations into 46 languages.[1] He is known as the creator of The No. 1 Ladies\\' Detective Agency series.[1][2] The \"McCall\" derives from his great-great-grandmother Bethea McCall, who married James Smith at Glencairn, Dumfries-shire, in 1833.[3]\\nRodney Alexander Alasdair McCall Smith was born in 1948 in Bulawayo in the British colony of Southern Rhodesia (present-day Zimbabwe), to British parents.[4] He was the only son, having three elder sisters.[5] His father worked as a public prosecutor in Bulawayo.[6] McCall Smith\\'s paternal grandfather, Dr. George Marshall McCall Smith, born in Nairn, abandoned his wife and four children in Scotland and ran off with one of his patients to New Zealand in 1914. They settled in Rawene where he became the medical doctor and a community leader.[7][8][9] McCall Smith was educated at the Christian Brothers College in Bulawayo before moving to Scotland at age 17 to study law at the University of Edinburgh, where he earned his LLB[10] and PhD degrees.[4][11] He soon taught at Queen\\'s University Belfast, and while teaching there he entered a literary competition: one a children\\'s book and the other a novel for adults. He won in the children\\'s category.[6]\\nMcCall Smith returned to southern Africa in 1981 to help co-found the law school and teach law at the University of Botswana.[4] While there, he co-wrote The Criminal Law of Botswana (1992).[12]\\nHe was Professor of Medical Law at the University of Edinburgh and is now Emeritus Professor at its School of Law.

       " 'Frank Morrison Spillane (/spɪˈleɪn/; March 9, 1918\\xa0– July 17, 2006), better known as Mickey Spillane, was an American crime novelist, whose stories often feature his signature detective character, Mike Hammer. More than 225 million copies of his books have sold internationally. Spillane was also an occasional actor, once even playing Hammer himself in the 1965 film The Girl Hunters.[2][3]\\nFrank Morrison Spillane was born March 9, 1918, in Brooklyn, New York, and primarily raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Spillane was the only child of his Irish bartender father, John Joseph Spillane, and his Scottish mother, Catherine Anne. During his late adolescence, his family returned to Brooklyn, where he graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in 1936.[4] He started writing while in high school, briefly attended Fort Hays State College in Kansas and worked a variety of jobs, including summers as a lifeguard at Breezy Point, Queens, and a period as a trampoline artist for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.[5]\\nDuring World War II, Spillane enlisted in the Army Air Corps, becoming a fighter pilot and a flight instructor.[6]\\nHe was first stationed at the air base in Greenwood, Mississippi, where he met and married first wife Mary Ann Pearce in 1945.[7] He also met two younger writers, Earle Basinsky and Charlie Wells, who would become his protégés; each published two hardboiled-noir novels in the Spillane style in the early 1950s.[8][9]\\nSpillane claims that he started being published as an author of slicks where he was credited under house names, then went \"lower\" to the pulps,[10] then went lower still as a writer for comic books.[11] While working as a salesman in Gimbels department store basement in 1940, he met tie salesman Joe Gill, who later found a lifetime career in scripting for Charlton Comics. Gill told Spillane to meet his brother, Ray Gill, who wrote for Funnies Inc., an outfit that packaged comic books for different publishers.[citation needed]\\nSpillane soon began writing an eight-page story every day. He concocted adventures for major 1940s comic book characters, including Captain Marvel, Superman, Batman, and Captain America. In the early 1940s, working for Funnies, Inc., he wrote two-page text stories which were syndicated to various comic book publishers, including Timely Comics. At one point, Spillane estimated he wrote fifty of these \"short-short stories,\" which were intended to fulfill a postal regulation requiring comic books to have at least two pages of text to qualify for a second-class mailing permit.[citation needed]\\nWhile most comic books writers toiled anonymously, Spillane\\'s byline appeared on most of his prose \"filler\" stories. 26 stories were collected in Primal Spillane: Early Stories 1941–1942 (Gryphon Books, 2003). A new, expanded edition of Primal Spillane was released by Bold Venture Press in 2018, the new volume contained an additional fifteen stories, including the previously unpublished \"A Turn of the Tide\".[citation needed]\\nSpillane joined the United States Army Air Corps on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In the mid-1940s he was stationed as a flight instructor in Greenwood, Mississippi, where he met and married Mary Ann Pearce in 1945. The couple wanted to buy a country house in the town of Newburgh, New York, 60 miles north of New York City, so Spillane decided to boost his bank account by writing a novel. He wrote I, the Jury in just 9 days.[5] At the suggestion of Ray Gill, he sent it to E. P. Dutton.[citation needed]\\nWith the combined total of the 1947 hardcover and the Signet paperback (December 1948), I, the Jury sold 6-1/2 million copies in the United States alone. I, the Jury introduced Spillane\\'s most famous character, hardboiled detective Mike Hammer. Although tame by some standards, his novels featured more sex than competing titles, and the violence was more overt than the usual detective story. Covers tended to feature scantily dressed women or women who appeared as if they were about to undress. In the beginning, Mike Hammer\\'s chief nemeses consisted of gangsters, but by the early \\'50s, this broadened to communists and deviants.[3]\\nAn early version of Spillane\\'s Mike Hammer character, called Mike Danger, was submitted in a script for a detective-themed comic book. \"Mike Hammer originally started out to be a comic book. I was gonna have a Mike Danger comic book,\" Spillane said in a 1984 interview.[12] Two Mike Danger comic-book stories were published in 1954 without Spillane\\'s knowledge, as well as one featuring Mike Lancer (1942). These were published with other material in \"Byline: Mickey Spillane,\" edited by Max Allan Collins and Lynn F. Myers, Jr. (Crippen & Landru publishers, 2004).\\nThe Mike Hammer series proved hugely successful during the 1950s and 1960s, but the books were excoriated by the literary establishment. Malcolm Cowley of The New Republic called Spillane \"a dangerous paranoid, sadist, and masochist\" and even his own editors sometimes found his novels distasteful. Spillane for his part was unmoved by critics, saying \"You can sell a lot more peanuts than caviar\" and \"The literary world is made of second rate writers writing about other second rate writers.\" Attractively low prices (25 cents for a paperback copy, later raised to 50 cents) helped sales, and the 1956 informative guide Sixty Years of Best Sellers found that the six novels Spillane had written up to that point were among the top ten best selling American fiction titles of all time.[citation needed]\\nThe Signet paperbacks displayed dramatic front cover illustrations. Lou Kimmel created the cover paintings for My Gun Is Quick, Vengeance Is Mine, One Lonely Night, and The Long Wait. The cover art for Kiss Me, Deadly was by James Meese.[citation needed]\\nSpillane portrayed himself as a detective in Ring of Fear (1954), and rewrote the film without credit for John Wayne\\'s and Robert Fellows\\'s Wayne-Fellows Productions. The film was directed by screenwriter James Edward Grant. Several Hammer novels were made into movies, including Kiss Me Deadly (1955). In The Girl Hunters (1963) filmed in England, Spillane himself appeared as Hammer, one of the few occasions in film history in which an author of a popular literary hero has portrayed his own character. Spillane was scheduled to film The Snake as a follow-up, but the film was never made.[13]\\nOn October 25, 1956, Spillane appeared on The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford, with interest on his Mike Hammer novels.[14] In January 1974, he appeared with Jack Cassidy in the television series Columbo starring Peter Falk in the episode \"Publish or Perish\". He portrayed a writer who is murdered.[15] In 1995 and 1997, he appeared in the low budget films Mommy and its sequel, Mommy 2: Mommy\\'s Day.\\nIn 1969, Spillane formed a production company with Robert Fellows who had produced The Girl Hunters to produce many of his books, but Fellows died soon after and only The Delta Factor was produced.[16]\\nDuring the 1980s, he appeared in Miller Lite beer commercials.[17] In the 1990s, Spillane licensed one of his characters to Tekno Comix for use in a science-fiction adventure series, Mike Danger. In his introduction to the series, Spillane said he had conceived of the character decades earlier but never used him.[12]\\nEarly reaction to Spillane\\'s work was generally hostile. Malcolm Cowley dismissed the Mike Hammer character as \"a homicidal paranoiac.\"[18] John G. Cawelti called Spillane\\'s writing \"atrocious,\" and Julian Symons called Spillane\\'s work \"nauseating.\"[18] By contrast, Ayn Rand publicly praised Spillane\\'s work at a time when critics were almost uniformly hostile.  She considered him an underrated if uneven stylist and found congenial the black-and-white morality of the Hammer stories. She later publicly repudiated what she regarded as the amorality of Spillane\\'s Tiger Mann stories.[citation needed]\\nSpillane\\'s work was later praised by Max Allan Collins, William L. DeAndrea,[3] and Robert L. Gale.[18] DeAndrea argued that although Spillane\\'s characters were stereotypes, Spillane had a \"flair for fast-action writing,\" that his work broke new ground for American crime fiction, and that Spillane\\'s prose \"is lean and spare and authentically tough, something that writers like Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald never achieved.\"[3]\\nGerman painter Markus Lüpertz claimed that Spillane\\'s writing influenced his own work, saying that Spillane ranks as one of the major poets of the 20th century. American comic book writer Frank Miller has mentioned Spillane as an influence for his own hardboiled style. Avant-Garde musician John Zorn composed a piece influenced by Spillane\\'s writing titled Spillane.[citation needed]\\nIn 1983, Spillane received the lifetime achievement award from the Private Eye Writers of America.[19] He also received an Edgar Allan Poe Grand Master Award in 1995.[20][21]\\nWalt Kelly wrote two parodies of Hammer\\'s work which satirized his spare, disjointed style, overblown first person narration, and teetering, barely controlled paranoia: \"The Bloody Drip\" and \"The Bloody Drip Writhes Again\", both starring Albert the Alligator as the detective Meat Hamburg. They were published in the following \"Pogo\" collections:\\nSpillane was also parodied several times in Mad Magazine. The April, 1959 issue carried a piece called \"If Mickey Spillane Wrote Nancy\" (the comic strip Nancy, by Ernie Bushmiller).[22]\\nThe television show \"MASH\" had an episode devoted to Mickey Spillane and his books.\\nIn 1987, New York avant-garde jazz musician John Zorn published \"Spillane\", an album composed of three \"file-card pieces\", as well as a work for voice, string quartet and turntables. It is named after mystery writer Mickey Spillane, whose novels featuring detective Mike Hammer provided the basis for the album\\'s title track. Zorn wrote \"Spillane\" on a series of index cards, each containing an outline or instruction for the musicians that was intended to evoke scenes from one of Spillane\\'s novels.\\nIn 1945, Mickey met and married Mary Ann Pearce. They had four children, Caroline, Kathy, Michael, and Ward. Their marriage ended in 1962.\\nIn November 1965, he married his second wife, nightclub singer Sherri Malinou. The marriage ended in divorce (and a lawsuit) in 1983.\\nSpillane shared his waterfront house in Murrells Inlet with his third wife, Jane Rogers Johnson, and her two daughters, Jennifer and Margaret Johnson.

       " 'Rex Todhunter Stout (/staʊt/; December 1, 1886 – October 27, 1975) was an American writer noted for his detective fiction. His best-known characters are the detective Nero Wolfe and his assistant Archie Goodwin, who were featured in 33 novels, and 41 novellas and short stories, between 1934 and 1975.\\nIn 1959, Stout received the Mystery Writers of America\\'s Grand Master Award. The Nero Wolfe corpus was nominated Best Mystery Series of the Century at Bouchercon XXXI, the world\\'s largest mystery convention, and Rex Stout was nominated Best Mystery Writer of the Century.\\nIn addition to writing fiction, Stout was a prominent public intellectual for decades. Stout was active in the early years of the American Civil Liberties Union and a founder of the Vanguard Press. He served as head of the Writers\\' War Board during World War II, became a radio celebrity through his numerous broadcasts, and was later active in promoting world federalism. He was the long-time president of the Authors Guild, during which he sought to benefit authors by lobbying for reform of the domestic and international copyright laws,[specify] and served a term as president of the Mystery Writers of America in 1959.\\nStout was born in Noblesville, Indiana, in 1886, but shortly afterwards his Quaker parents John Wallace Stout and Lucetta Elizabeth Todhunter Stout moved their family (nine children in all) to Kansas.\\nHis father was a teacher who encouraged his son to read, leading to Rex having read the entire Bible twice by the age of four. At age thirteen he was the state spelling bee champion. Stout attended Topeka High School, Kansas, and the University of Kansas, Lawrence. His sister, Ruth Stout, also authored several books on no-work gardening and some social commentaries.\\nHe served in the U.S. Navy from 1906 to 1908 (including service as a yeoman on Theodore Roosevelt\\'s presidential yacht) and then spent about the next four years working at a series of jobs in six states, including cigar-store clerk.\\nIn 1910–11, Stout sold three short poems to the literary magazine The Smart Set. Between 1912 and 1918, he published about forty works of fiction in various magazines, ranging from literary publications such as Smith\\'s Magazine and Lippincott\\'s Monthly Magazine to pulp magazines like the All-Story Weekly.\\nNot his writing, but his invention of a school banking system in about 1916 gave him enough money to travel in Europe extensively. About 400 U.S. schools adopted his system for keeping track of the money that school children saved in accounts at school, and he was paid royalties.\\nIn 1916, Stout married Fay Kennedy of Topeka, Kansas. They divorced in February 1932[1]:\\u200axx\\u200a and, in December 1932, Stout married Pola Weinbach Hoffmann, a designer who had studied with Josef Hoffmann in Vienna.[2]:\\u200a234–236\\u200a[a][b]\\nRex Stout began his literary career in the 1910s writing for magazines, particularly pulp magazines, writing more than 40 stories that appeared between 1912 and 1918. Stout\\'s early stories appeared most frequently in All-Story Magazine and its affiliates, but he was also published in Smith\\'s Magazine, Lippincott\\'s Monthly Magazine, Short Stories, The Smart Set, Young\\'s Magazine, and Golfers\\' Magazine. The early stories spanned genres including romance, adventure, science fiction/fantasy, and detective fiction, including two serialized murder mystery novellas that prefigured elements of the Wolfe stories.\\nIn 1916, Stout was tired of writing a story whenever he needed money. He decided to stop writing until he had made enough money to support himself through other means, so that he would be able to write when and as he pleased. He wrote no fiction for more than a decade, until the late 1920s, when he had saved substantial money through his school banking system. Ironically, just as Stout was starting to write fiction again, he lost most of the money that he had made as a businessman in the Great Depression of 1929.\\nIn 1929, Stout wrote his first published book How Like a God, an unusual psychological story written in the second person and published by the Vanguard Press, which he had helped to found. During this phase of his writing career, Stout also published a pioneering political thriller The President Vanishes (1934), which was originally published anonymously.\\nIn the 1930s, Stout turned to writing detective fiction. In 1933–34, he wrote Fer-de-Lance, which introduced Nero Wolfe and his assistant Archie Goodwin. The novel was published by Farrar & Rinehart in October 1934, and in abridged form as \"Point of Death\" in The American Magazine (November 1934). The characters of Wolfe and Goodwin are considered among Stout\\'s main contributions to detective fiction. Wolfe was described by reviewer Will Cuppy as \"that Falstaff of detectives\".[2]:\\u200a287\\u200a[5][c]\\nIn 1937, Stout\\'s novel The Hand in the Glove introduced the character of Theodolinda \"Dol\" Bonner, a female private detective who would appear in later Wolfe stories and who is an early and significant example of the woman PI as fictional protagonist. He also created two other detective protagonists, Tecumseh Fox and Alphabet Hicks. After 1938, Stout wrote no fiction but mysteries, and after 1940, almost entirely Nero Wolfe stories. Stout continued writing the Nero Wolfe series for the rest of his life, publishing at least one adventure per year through 1966 (with the exception of 1943, when he was busy with activities related to World War II). Stout\\'s rate of production declined somewhat after 1966, but he still published four further Nero Wolfe novels prior to his death in 1975, at the age of 88.\\nDuring World War II, Stout cut back on his detective writing, joined the Fight for Freedom organization, and wrote propaganda. He hosted three weekly radio shows and coordinated the volunteer services of American writers to help the war effort. After the war, Stout returned to writing Nero Wolfe novels and took up the role of gentleman farmer on his estate at High Meadow in Brewster, north of New York City. He served as president of the Authors Guild and of the Mystery Writers of America, which in 1959 presented Stout with the Grand Master Award – the pinnacle of achievement in the mystery field.\\nStout was a longtime friend of British humorist P. G. Wodehouse, writer of the Jeeves novels and short stories. Each was a fan of the other\\'s work, and parallels are evident between their characters and techniques. Wodehouse contributed the foreword to Rex Stout: A Biography, John McAleer\\'s Edgar Award-winning 1977 biography of the author (reissued in 2002 as Rex Stout: A Majesty\\'s Life). Wodehouse also mentions Rex Stout in several of his Jeeves books, as both Bertie and his Aunt Dahlia are fans.\\nIn the fall of 1925, Roger Nash Baldwin appointed Rex Stout to the board of the American Civil Liberties Union\\'s powerful National Council on Censorship; Stout served one term.[2]:\\u200a196–197\\u200a Stout helped start the radical Marxist magazine The New Masses, which succeeded The Masses and The Liberator in 1926.[6] He had been told that the magazine was primarily committed to bringing arts and letters to the masses, but he realized after a few issues \"that it was Communist and intended to stay Communist\", and he ended his association with it.[2]:\\u200a197–198\\u200a\\nStout was one of the officers and directors of the Vanguard Press, a publishing house established with a grant from the Garland Fund to reprint left-wing classics at an affordable cost and publish new books otherwise deemed \"unpublishable\" by the commercial press of the day. He served as Vanguard\\'s first president from 1926 to 1928, and continued as vice president until at least 1931. During his tenure, Vanguard issued 150 titles, including seven books by Scott Nearing and three of Stout\\'s own novels—How Like a God (1929), Seed on the Wind (1930), and Golden Remedy (1931).[2]:\\u200a196–197\\u200a\\nIn 1942, Stout described himself as a \"pro-Labor, pro-New Deal, pro-Roosevelt left liberal\".[7]\\nDuring World War II, he worked with the advocacy group Friends of Democracy, chaired the Writers\\' War Board (a propaganda organization), and supported the embryonic United Nations. He lobbied for Franklin D. Roosevelt to accept a fourth term as president. He developed an extreme anti-German attitude and wrote the provocative essay \"We Shall Hate, or We Shall Fail\"[8] which generated a flood of protests after its January 1943 publication in The New York Times.[1]:\\u200a95\\u200a The attitude is expressed by Nero Wolfe in the 1942 novella \"Not Quite Dead Enough\".\\nOn August 9, 1942, Stout conducted the first of 62 wartime broadcasts of Our Secret Weapon on CBS Radio. The idea for the counterpropaganda series had been that of Sue Taylor White, wife of Paul White, the first director of CBS News. Research was done under White\\'s direction. \"Hundreds of Axis propaganda broadcasts, beamed not merely to the Allied countries but to neutrals, were sifted weekly\", wrote Stout\\'s biographer John McAleer. \"Rex himself, for an average of twenty hours a week, pored over the typewritten yellow sheets of accumulated data ... Then, using a dialogue format – Axis commentators making their assertions, and Rex Stout, the lie detective, offering his refutations – he dictated to his secretary the script of the fifteen-minute broadcast.\" By November 1942, Berlin Radio was reporting that \"Rex Stout himself has cut his own production in detective stories from four to one a year and is devoting the entire balance of his time to writing official war propaganda.\" Newsweek described Stout as \"stripping Axis short-wave propaganda down to the barest nonsensicals ... There\\'s no doubt of its success.\"[1]:\\u200a121–122\\u200a[2]:\\u200a305–307\\u200a\\nIn September 1942, Stout defended FDR\\'s policy of sending Japanese Americans to concentration camps in a debate with the Socialist civil libertarian Norman Thomas. Stout charged “that Japanese-Americans include more fifth columnists than any other comparable group in the United States.” When Thomas condemned the military’s role as a “disgrace to our democracy” and comparable to “the powers of totalitarian dictators,” Stout responded  that moving “Japanese-Americans inland hardly constitutes Totalitarianism.” [9]\\n\\nDuring the later part of the war and the post-war period, he also led the Society for the Prevention of World War III which lobbied for a harsh peace for Germany. When the war ended, Stout became active in the United World Federalists.[10]\\nHouse Committee on Un-American Activities chairman Martin Dies called him a Communist, and Stout is reputed to have said to him, \"I hate Communists as much as you do, Martin, but there\\'s one difference between us. I know what a Communist is and you don\\'t.\"[11]\\nStout was one of many American writers closely watched by J. Edgar Hoover\\'s FBI. Hoover considered him an enemy of the bureau and either a Communist or a tool of Communist-dominated groups. Stout\\'s leadership of the Authors League of America during the McCarthy era was particularly irksome to the FBI. About a third of Stout\\'s FBI file is devoted to his 1965 novel The Doorbell Rang.[12]:\\u200a216–217,\\u200a227\\u200a[d][e]\\nIn later years, Stout alienated some readers with his hawkish stance on the Vietnam War and with the contempt for communism expressed in certain of his works. The latter viewpoint is given voice in the 1952 novella \"Home to Roost\" (first published as \"Nero Wolfe and the Communist Killer\") and most notably in the 1949 novel, The Second Confession. In this work, Archie and Wolfe express their dislike for \"Commies\", while at the same time Wolfe arranges for the firing of a virulently anti-Communist broadcaster, likening him to \"Hitler\" and \"Mussolini\".\\nStout continued writing until just before his death. He died on October 27, 1975, at the age of 88 at his estate, High Meadow, on the New York/Connecticut border.[14]\\nIf he had done nothing more than to create Archie Goodwin, Rex Stout would deserve the gratitude of whatever assessors watch over the prosperity of American literature. For surely Archie is one of the folk heroes in which the modern American temper can see itself transfigured.\"A number of the paintings of René Magritte (1898–1967), the internationally famous Belgian painter, are named after titles of books by Rex Stout,\" wrote Harry Torczyner, Magritte\\'s attorney and friend.[2]:\\u200a578\\u200a[g][h] \"He read Hegel, Heidegger and Sartre, as well as Dashiell Hammett, Rex Stout and Georges Simenon,\" the Times Higher Education Supplement wrote of Magritte. \"Some of his best titles were \\'found\\' in this way.\"[20] Magritte\\'s 1942 painting Les compagnons de la peur (\"The Companions of Fear\") bears the title given to The League of Frightened Men (1935) when it was published in France by Gallimard (1939). It is one of Magritte\\'s series of \"leaf-bird\" paintings, created during the Nazi occupation of Brussels. It depicts a stormy, mountainous landscape in which a cluster of plants has metamorphosed into a group of vigilant owls.[21]\\nStout is also mentioned in Ian Fleming\\'s James Bond book On Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service (1963).[citation needed]\\nThe Rex Stout Archive anchors Boston College\\'s collection of American detective fiction.[22] The collection was donated by the Stout family and includes manuscripts, correspondence, legal papers, personal papers, publishing contracts, photographs, and ephemera. It also includes first editions, international editions, and archived reprints of Stout\\'s books, as well as volumes from Stout\\'s personal library, many of which found their way into Nero Wolfe\\'s office. The comprehensive archive at Burns Library also includes the extensive personal collection of Stout\\'s official biographer John McAleer, the Rex Stout collection of bibliographer Judson C. Sapp, and a collection of Nero Wolfe\\'s magazine appearances donated by Ed Price.[23]\\n',\n",

       " '\\nHemendra Kumar Roy (2 September 1888 – 18 April 1963) was an Indian Bengali writer noted for his contribution to the early development of the genre of children\\'s literature in the language.[1] He was a noted contributor to the early development of Bengali detective fiction with his \\'Jayanta-Manik\\' and adventurist \\'Bimal-Kumar\\' stories, dealing with the exploits of Jayanta, his assistant Manik, and police inspector Sunderbabu. Roy also translated the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyám into Bengali.[2] Roy\\'s \\'Ajab Deshe Amala\\' is a well-known translation of Alice in Wonderland.\\nSon of Radhikaprasad Roy, Hemendrakumar was born in Kolkata in 1888, in an affluent family originally hailing from Pathuriaghata. Roy inherited a part of his artistic talent from his father who was a more than competent player of the Esraj (a string instrument) and regularly gave performance at the famed Star Theatre in North Kolkata.  His first published work was a short-story Amar Kahini that appeared in the magazine Basudha in 1903. In 1916, he joined the circle of writers that published in the Bharati journal edited by Sourindramohan Mukherjee and Manilal Ganguly. He also composed a number of horror stories for children.\\nIn 1925, Hemendrakumar Ray became the editor of Nachghar. Apart from this magazine, he helped edit other literary magazines including Rongmoshal.  During the next few decades, Hemendrakumar Ray wrote over 80 books for children.  He was monumental in contributing a body of detective, horror, and science-fiction work that would form a substantial portion of the early literature for children in Bengali. In 1930, he wrote his first detective story which was published in Mouchak. He is best remembered as the creator of Bimal-Kumar, the adventurer duo and Jayanta-Manik the detective duo.  It was Bimal-Kumar\\'s adventure story  Jokher Dhan, for which he is famous in Bengali literature for children. He was a staunch believer in supernaturals (according to Khagendranath Mitra in his Introduction to Hemendra Kumar Roy Rachanabali, Volume 1) and he used the supernatural element in several of his adventure and mystery stories. One of the recurring characters in his stories and novels featuring Jayanta-Manik was Inspector Sunderbabu, a chubby and somewhat-cowardly police officer with an insatiable appetite who was also a good friend to the detectives. In Ratrir Jatri, Roy introduced a new detective character named, Hemanta Choudhury and his friend-associate Robin. Apart from literary productions for children, Roy also wrote numerous essays, short stories, and novels for adults. He adapted some foreign author\\'s stories in Bengali.He was also a painter and the choreographer for Shishirkumar Bhaduri\\'s Seeta. He also wrote a volume of lyrics Jaubaner Gaan (that is, \\'The Song of Youth\\').  Several of these lyrics were put to music and sung by Bengali legends like Sachin Dev Burman, Kanai Dey, and Manna Dey. Kazi Nazrul Islam composed music for the lyrics of Hemendra Kumar.One of his short stories, Sindur Chupri, was translated into German and was included in a collection of short stories.  He created a comic series titled Tara Teen Bondhu, which consists of seven short stories such as \\'Kukur Kahini\\', \\'Nakuler Daon Mara\\', \\'Maharaja Chor Churamoni Bahadur\\', \\'Kamon Kore Totlami Sare\\', \\'Kartik Pujor Bhoot\\', \\'Der Dozon Jahagi\\', and \\'Madhureno Somapoyet\\'.  The three main character of this series - Atal, Patol and Nakul - won huge popularity among the children and youngsters. One of his stories, \\'Dersho Khokar Kando\\' (that is, \\'The Deeds of 150 Boys\\') was made into a film, while several of his works, namely Abar Jokher Dhon and Ratrir Jatri, have been adapted for television.  His story Nishithini Bibhisikha was adapted for Bengali movie named Jighansha(1951).  The superhit Hindi film Bees Saal Baad was based on the story of Nishithini Bibhisikha.[3] In 1939 a movie named Jakher Dhan based on Hemendrakumar\\'s novel in the same name was made by director Haricharan Bhanja. This film starred Chhaya Devi, Ahindra Choudhury, Jahar Ganguly.[4] This was one of the most popular thriller of Bengali literature. A television serial in the same name was also telecast. over the story in the 1990s. Another Bengali movie in the named Jawker Dhan was released in August, 2017 directed by Sayantan Ghoshal.[5]\\nPinaki Roy, who has offered post-colonial interpretations of Bengali detective fiction, gives primacy to Roy more as a writer of sleuth narratives than of children\\'s literature. Pinaki Roy credits the litterateur for initiating a trend which would ultimately bring Bengali detective-story-writing from its colonial phase to its anti-imperialistic one: \"Jayanta, the detective-cum-scientist, is probably one of the earlier fictional Indian sleuths who use their Indian sensibilities to capture Indian criminals operating in what could be identified as an \\'indigenous\\' atmosphere. That Roy would adapt Bram Stoker\\'s Dracula into Bishalgarer Dushshashan, Arthur Conan Doyle\\'s The Hound of the Baskervilles into Nishachari Bibhishika and Agatha Christie\\'s Ten Little Niggers into Haradhaner Deep attest to his conscious following of Western sleuth writings in order to make something Indian - and therefore post-colonial - out of them\".\\n',\n",
       " '\\nSatyajit Ray  (Bengali pronunciation: [ˈʃotːodʒit ˈrae̯] ⓘ; 2 May 1921\\xa0– 23 April 1992) was an Indian director, screenwriter, documentary filmmaker, author, essayist, lyricist, magazine editor, illustrator, calligrapher, and composer. \\nRay is not only widely considered one of the greatest and most influential Indian directors of all time[7][8] but has been often described as \"one of the world\\'s greatest directors\".[9][10][11] He is celebrated for works including The Apu Trilogy (1955–1959),[12] The Music Room (1958), The Big City (1963) and Charulata (1964) and the Goopy–Bagha trilogy.\\nRay was born in Calcutta to nonsense rhyme author Sukumar Ray. Starting his career as a commercial artist, Ray was drawn into independent film-making after meeting French filmmaker Jean Renoir and viewing Vittorio De Sica\\'s Italian neorealist film Bicycle Thieves (1948) during a visit to London.\\nRay directed 36 films, including feature films, documentaries, and shorts. Ray\\'s first film, Pather Panchali (1955) won eleven international prizes, including the inaugural Best Human Document award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. This film, along with Aparajito (1956) and Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) (1959), form The Apu Trilogy. Ray did the scripting, casting, scoring, and editing, and designed his own credit titles and publicity material. He also authored several short stories and novels, primarily for young children and teenagers. Popular characters created by Ray include Feluda the sleuth, Professor Shonku the scientist, Tarini Khuro the storyteller, and Lalmohan Ganguly the novelist.\\nRay received many major awards in his career, including thirty-six Indian National Film Awards, a Golden Lion, a Golden Bear, two Silver Bears, many additional awards at international film festivals and ceremonies, and an Academy Honorary Award in 1992. In 1978, he was awarded an honorary degree by Oxford University. The Government of India honoured him with the Bharat Ratna, its highest civilian award, in 1992.\\nOn the occasion of the birth centenary of Ray, the International Film Festival of India, in recognition of the auteur\\'s legacy, rechristened in 2021 its annual Lifetime Achievement award to \"Satyajit Ray Lifetime Achievement Award\".\\nSatyajit Ray\\'s ancestry can be traced back for at least ten generations.[13] His family had acquired the name \\'Ray\\' (originally \\'Rai\\') from the Mughals. Although they were Bengali Kayasthas, the Rays were \\'Vaishnavas\\' (worshippers of Vishnu),[14] as opposed to the majority of Bengali Kayasthas who were \\'Shaktos\\' (worshippers of the Shakti or Shiva).[15]\\nThe earliest-recorded ancestor of Ray family was Ramsunder Deo (Deb), born in the middle of the sixteenth century.[14][16] He was a native of Chakdah village in Nadia district of present-day West Bengal, India and migrated to Sherpur in East Bengal. He became son-in-law of the ruler of Jashodal and was granted a jagir (a feudal land grant) at Jashodal (in present day Kishoreganj District of Bangladesh).[17] His descendants migrated to the village Masua in Katiadi Upazila of Kishoreganj district in the first half of eighteenth century.[17][18] Satyajit Ray\\'s grandfather Upendrakishore Ray was born in Masua village in 1863.[16] Upendrakishore\\'s elder brother Saradaranjan Ray was one of the pioneers of Indian cricket who was called the W.G. Grace of India.\\nUpendrakishore Ray was a writer, illustrator, philosopher, publisher, amateur astronomer, and a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, a religious and social movement in 19th-century Bengal. He set up a printing press named U. Ray and Sons.[19]\\nSukumar Ray, Upendrakishore\\'s son and father of Satyajit, was an illustrator, critic, and a pioneering Bengali writer of nonsense rhyme (Abol Tabol) and children\\'s literature.[19] Social worker and children\\'s book author Shukhalata Rao was his aunt.[20]\\nSatyajit Ray was born to Sukumar Ray and Suprabha Ray (nee Das Gupta) in Calcutta (now Kolkata). Sukumar Ray died when Satyajit was two years old.[21] Ray grew up in the house of his grandfather, Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury, and of his printing press. He was attracted by the machines and process of printing from an early age, and took particular interest in the production process of Sandesh, a children\\'s magazine started by Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury.[22]  Ray studied at Ballygunge Government High School in Calcutta, and completed his BA in economics at Presidency College, Calcutta (then affiliated with the University of Calcutta). During his school days, he saw a number of Hollywood productions in cinema.[23] The works of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Ernst Lubitsch and movies such as The Thief of Baghdad and  Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin made lasting impression on his mind.[23] He developed keen interest in Western classical music.[24]\\nIn 1940, his mother insisted him to study at Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan, founded by Rabindranath Tagore. Ray was reluctant to go, due to his fondness for Calcutta and the low regard for the intellectual life at Santiniketan.[25] His mother\\'s persuasiveness and his respect for Tagore finally convinced him to get admitted there for higher studies in Fine Art. In Santiniketan, Ray came to appreciate Oriental art. He later admitted that he learned much from the famous painters Nandalal Bose and Benode Behari Mukherjee.[26] He later produced a documentary, The Inner Eye, about Mukherjee. His visits to Ajanta, Ellora and Elephanta stimulated his admiration for Indian art.[27] Three books that he read in the university influenced him to become a serious student of film-making: Paul Rotha\\'s The Film Till Now, and two books on theory by Rudolf Arnheim and Raymond Spottiswoode.[28] Ray dropped out of the art course in 1942 as he could not feel inspired to become a painter.[28]\\nIn 1943, Ray started working at D.J. Keymer, a British advertising agency, as a junior visualiser. Here he was trained in Indian commercial art under artist Annada Munshi\\xa0[bn], the then Art Director of D.J. Keymer.[29] Although he liked visual design (graphic design) and he was mostly treated well, there was tension between the British and Indian employees of the firm. The British were better paid, and Ray felt that \"the clients were generally stupid.\"[30] In 1943, Ray started a second job for the Signet Press, a new publishing house started by D. K. Gupta.[31] Gupta asked Ray to create book cover designs for the company and gave him complete artistic freedom. Ray established himself as a commercial illustrator, becoming a leading Indian typographer and book-jacket designer.[32]\\n\\nRay designed covers for many books, including Jibanananda Das\\'s Banalata Sen and Rupasi Bangla, Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay\\'s Chander Pahar, Jim Corbett\\'s Maneaters of Kumaon, and Jawaharlal Nehru\\'s Discovery of India.[31] He worked on a children\\'s version of Pather Panchali, a classic Bengali novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, renamed Aam Antir Bhepu (The mango-seed whistle). Ray designed the cover and illustrated the book, and was deeply influenced by the work. He used it as the subject of his first film and featured his illustrations as shots in his ground-breaking film.[33]Ray befriended the American soldiers stationed in Calcutta during World War II, who kept him informed about the latest American films showing in the city. He came to know a RAF employee, Norman Clare, who shared Ray\\'s passion for films, chess and western classical music.[34] Ray was a regular in the addas (freestyle casual conversations)  at Coffee House where several intellectuals frequented. He formed lasting association with some of the compatriots, such as Bansi Chandragupta (who late became a celebrated art director), Kamal Kumar Majumdar (a polymath and author of stylish prose), Radha Prasad Gupta, Chidananda Das Gupta (film critic).[35] Along with Chidananda Dasgupta and others, Ray founded the Calcutta Film Society in 1947.[36] They screened many foreign films, many of which Ray watched and seriously studied, including several American and Russian films.[37] The use of Indian music and dancing in the 1948 Indian film Kalpana (transl.\\u2009Imagination), directed by the celebrated dancer Uday Shankar, had impact on Ray.[38]\\nIn 1949, Ray married Bijoya Das, his first cousin and long-time sweetheart.[39] The couple had a son, Sandip Ray, a film director.[40] In the same year, French director Jean Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River. Ray helped him to find locations in the countryside. Ray told Renoir about his idea of filming Pather Panchali, which had long been on his mind, and Renoir encouraged him in the project.[41]\\nIn 1950, D.J. Keymer sent Ray to London to work at the headquarters. During his six months in London, Ray watched 99 films, including Alexander Dovzhenko\\'s Earth (1930) and Jean Renoir\\'s The Rules of the Game (1939).[42] However, the film that had the most profound effect on him was the neorealist film Ladri di biciclette (Bicycle Thieves) (1948) by Vittorio De Sica.[43] Ray later said that he walked out of the theatre determined to become a filmmaker.[43]\\nAfter being \"deeply moved\" by Pather Panchali,[44] the 1928 classic Bildungsroman of Bengali literature, Ray decided to adapt it for his first film. Pather Panchali is a semi-autobiographical novel describing the maturation of Apu, a small boy in a Bengal village.[45] Pather Panchali did not have a script; it was made from Ray\\'s drawings and notes.[46] Before principal photography began, he created a storyboard dealing with details and continuity.[47] Years later, he donated those drawings and notes to Cinémathèque Française.[48]\\nRay gathered an inexperienced crew, although both his cameraman Subrata Mitra and art director Bansi Chandragupta would go on to achieve great acclaim. The cast consisted of mostly amateur actors. After unsuccessful attempts to persuade many producers to finance the project, Ray started shooting in late 1952 with his personal savings and hoped to raise more money once he had some footage shot, but did not succeed on his terms.[49] As a result, Ray shot Pather Panchali over two and a half years, an unusually long period.[49] He refused funding from sources who wanted to change the script or exercise supervision over production. He also ignored advice from the Indian government to incorporate a happy ending, but he did receive funding that allowed him to complete the film.[50]\\nMonroe Wheeler, head of the department of exhibitions and publications at New York\\'s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA),[51] heard about the project when he visited Calcutta in 1954. He considered the incomplete footage to be of high quality and encouraged Ray to finish the film so that it could be shown at a MoMA exhibition the following year.[52] Six months later, American director John Huston, on a visit to India for some early location scouting for The Man Who Would Be King, saw excerpts of the unfinished film and recognised \"the work of a great film-maker\".[53]\\nWith a loan from the West Bengal government, Ray finally completed the film; it was released in 1955 to critical acclaim. It earned numerous awards and had long theatrical runs in India and abroad. The Times of India wrote \"It is absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema [...] Pather Panchali is pure cinema.\"[54] In the United Kingdom, Lindsay Anderson wrote a positive review of the film.[54] However, the film also gained negative reactions; François Truffaut was reported to have said, \"I don\\'t want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands.\"[55] Bosley Crowther, then the most influential critic of The New York Times, criticised the film\\'s loose structure and conceded that it \"takes patience to be enjoyed\".[56] Edward Harrison, an American distributor was worried that Crowther\\'s review would dissuade audiences, but the film enjoyed an eight months theatrical run in the United States.[57]\\nRay\\'s international career started in earnest after the success of his next film, the second in The Apu Trilogy, Aparajito (1956) (The Unvanquished).[58] This film depicts the eternal struggle between the ambitions of a young man, Apu, and the mother who loves him.[58] Upon release, Aparajito won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, bringing Ray considerable acclaim.[59] In a retrospective review, Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Ray for his ability to capture emotions, and blend music with storytelling to create a \"flawless\" picture.[60] Critics such as Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak rank it higher than Ray\\'s first film.[58]\\nRay directed and released two other films in 1958: the comic Parash Pathar (The Philosopher\\'s Stone), and Jalsaghar (The Music Room), a film about the decadence of the Zamindars, considered one of his most important works.[61] Time Out magazine gave Jalsaghar a positive review, describing it as \"slow, rapt and hypnotic\".[62]\\nWhile making Aparajito, Ray had not planned a trilogy, but after he was asked about the idea in Venice, it appealed to him.[63] He finished the last of the trilogy, Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. Ray introduced two of his favourite actors, Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore, in this film. It opens with Apu living in a Calcutta house in near-poverty; he becomes involved in an unusual marriage with Aparna. The scenes of their life together form \"one of the cinema\\'s classic affirmative depictions of married life.\"[64] Critics Robin Wood and Aparna Sen thought it was a major achievement to mark the end of the trilogy.\\nAfter Apur Sansar was harshly criticised by a Bengali critic, Ray wrote an article defending it. He rarely responded to critics during his filmmaking career, but also later defended his film Charulata, his personal favourite.[65] Critic Roger Ebert summarised the trilogy as \"It is about a time, place and culture far removed from our own, and yet it connects directly and deeply with our human feelings. It is like a prayer, affirming that this is what the cinema can be, no matter how far in our cynicism we may stray.\"[66]\\nDespite Ray\\'s success, it had little influence on his personal life in the years to come. He continued to live with his wife and children in a rented house on Lake Avenue in South Calcutta,[67] with his mother, uncle and other members of his extended family.[68] The home is currently owned by ISKCON.\\nDuring this period, Ray made films about the British Raj period, a documentary on Tagore, a comic film (Mahapurush) and his first film from an original screenplay (\\'Kanchenjungha\\'). He also made a series of films that, taken together, are considered by critics among the most deeply felt portrayals of Indian women on screen.[69]\\nRay followed Apur Sansar with 1960\\'s Devi (The Goddess), a film in which he examined the superstitions in society. Sharmila Tagore starred as Doyamoyee, a young wife who is deified by her father-in-law. Ray was worried that the Central Board of Film Certification might block his film, or at least make him re-cut it, but Devi was spared. Upon international distribution, the critic from Chicago Reader described the film as \"full of sensuality and ironic undertones\".[70]\\nIn 1961, on the insistence of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Ray was commissioned to make Rabindranath Tagore, based on the poet of the same name, on the occasion of his birth centennial, a tribute to the person who likely most influenced Ray. Due to limited footage of Tagore, Ray was challenged by the necessity of making the film mainly with static material. He said that it took as much work as three feature films.[71]\\nIn the same year, together with Subhas Mukhopadhyay and others, Ray was able to revive Sandesh, the children\\'s magazine which his grandfather had founded.[19] Ray had been saving money for some years to make this possible. A duality in the name (Sandesh means both \"news\" in Bengali and also a sweet popular dessert) set the tone of the magazine (both educational and entertaining). Ray began to make illustrations for it, as well as to write stories and essays for children. Writing eventually became a steady source of income.[72]\\nIn 1962, Ray directed Kanchenjungha, Based on his first original screenplay, it was also his first colour film. It tells the story of an upper-class family spending an afternoon in Darjeeling, a picturesque hill town in West Bengal. They try to arrange the engagement of their youngest daughter to a highly paid engineer educated in London.\\nRay had first conceived shooting the film in a large mansion, but later decided to film it in the famous town. He used many shades of light and mist to reflect the tension in the drama. Ray noted that while his script allowed shooting to be possible under any lighting conditions, a commercial film crew in Darjeeling failed to shoot a single scene, as they only wanted to do so in sunshine.[73] The New York Times\\' Bosley Crowther gave the film a mixed review; he praised Ray\\'s \"soft and relaxed\" filmmaking but thought the characters were clichés.[74]\\nIn 1964, Ray directed Charulata (The Lonely Wife). One of Ray\\'s favourite films, it was regarded by many critics as his most accomplished.[75] Based on Tagore\\'s short story, Nastanirh (Broken Nest), the film tells of a lonely wife, Charu, in 19th-century Bengal, and her growing feelings for her brother-in-law Amal. In retrospective reviews, The Guardian called it \"extraordinarily vivid and fresh\",[76] while The Sydney Morning Herald praised Madhabi Mukherjee\\'s casting, the film\\'s visual style, and its camera movements.[77] Ray said the film contained the fewest flaws among his work and it was his only work which, given a chance, he would make exactly the same way.[78] At the 15th Berlin International Film Festival, Charulata earned him a Silver Bear for Best Director.[79] Other films in this period include Mahanagar (The Big City), Teen Kanya (Three Daughters), Abhijan (The Expedition), Kapurush (The Coward) and Mahapurush (Holy Man). The first of these, Mahanagar drew praise from British critics; Philip French opined that it was one of Ray\\'s best.[80][81]\\nAlso in the 1960s, Ray visited Japan and took pleasure in meeting filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, whom he highly regarded.[82]\\nIn the post-Charulata period, Ray took on various projects, from fantasy, science fiction, and detective stories to historical dramas. Ray also experimented during this period, exploring contemporary issues of Indian life in response to the perceived lack of these issues in his films.\\nThe first major film in this period is 1966\\'s Nayak (The Hero), the story of a screen hero travelling in a train and meeting a young, sympathetic female journalist. Starring Uttam Kumar and Sharmila Tagore, in the twenty-four hours of the journey, the film explores the inner conflict of the apparently highly successful matinée idol. Although the film received a \"Critics Prize\" at the Berlin International Film Festival, it had a generally muted reception.[83]\\n\\nIn 1967, Ray wrote a script for a film to be called The Alien, based on his short story \"Bankubabur Bandhu\" (\"Banku Babu\\'s Friend\"), which he wrote in 1962 for Sandesh magazine. It was planned to be a U.S. and India co-production with Columbia Pictures, with Marlon Brando and Peter Sellers cast in the leading roles. Ray found that his script had been copyrighted and the fee appropriated by Michael Wilson. Wilson had initially approached Ray through their mutual friend, Arthur C. Clarke, to represent him in Hollywood. Wilson copyrighted the script credited to Mike Wilson & Satyajit Ray, although he contributed only one word. Ray later said that he never received compensation for the script.[84] After Brando dropped out of the project, the producers tried to replace him with James Coburn, but Ray became disillusioned and returned to Calcutta.[84] Columbia attempted to revive the project, without success, in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1969, Ray directed one of his most commercially successful films; a musical fantasy based on a children\\'s story written by his grandfather, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha).[85] It is about the journey of Goopy the singer, and Bagha the drummer, endowed with three gifts by the King of Ghosts, to stop an impending war between two neighbouring kingdoms. One of his most expensive projects, the film was also difficult to finance. Ray abandoned his desire to shoot it in colour, as he turned down an offer that would have forced him to cast a certain Hindi film actor as the lead.[86] He also composed the songs and music for the film.[87]\\nNext, Ray directed the film adaptation of a novel by the poet and writer, Sunil Gangopadhyay. Featuring a musical motif structure acclaimed as more complex than Charulata,[88] Aranyer Din Ratri (1970) (Days and Nights in the Forest) follows four urban young men going to the forests for a vacation. They try to leave their daily lives behind, but one of them encounters women, and it becomes a deep study of the Indian middle class.[89] First shown at the New York Film Festival in 1970, critic Pauline Kael wrote \"Satyajit Ray\\'s films can give rise to a more complex feeling of happiness in me than the work of any other director [...] No artist has done more than Ray to make us reevaluate the commonplace\".[90] Writing for the BBC in 2002, Jamie Russell complimented the script, pacing and mixture of emotions.[91] According to one critic, Robin Wood, \"a single sequence [of the film] ... would offer material for a short essay\".[88]\\nAfter Aranyer Din Ratri, Ray addressed contemporary Bengali life. He completed what became known as the Calcutta trilogy: Pratidwandi (1970), Seemabaddha (1971), and Jana Aranya (1975), three films that were conceived separately but had similar themes.[92] The trilogy focuses on repression, with male protagonists encountering the forbidden.[93] Pratidwandi (The Adversary) is about an idealist young graduate; while disillusioned by the end of film, he is still uncorrupted. Seemabaddha (Company Limited) portrayed a successful man giving up his morality for further gains. Jana Aranya (The Middleman) depicted a young man giving in to the culture of corruption to earn a living. In the first film, Pratidwandi, Ray introduces new narrative techniques, such as scenes in negative, dream sequences, and abrupt flashbacks.[92]\\nAlso in the 1970s, Ray adapted two of his popular stories as detective films. Although mainly aimed at children and young adults, both Sonar Kella (The Golden Fortress) and Joi Baba Felunath (The Elephant God) became cult favourites.[94] In a 2019 review of Sonar Kella, critic Rouven Linnarz was impressed with its use of Indian classical instruments to generate \"mysterious progression\".[95]\\nRay considered making a film on the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War but later abandoned the idea, saying that, as a filmmaker, he was more interested in the travails of the refugees and not the politics.[96] In 1977, Ray completed Shatranj Ke Khilari (The Chess Players), a Hindustani film based on a short story by Munshi Premchand. It was set in Lucknow in the state of Oudh, a year before the Indian Rebellion of 1857. A commentary on issues related to the colonisation of India by the British, it was Ray\\'s first feature film in a language other than Bengali. It starred a high-profile cast including Sanjeev Kumar, Saeed Jaffrey, Amjad Khan, Shabana Azmi, Victor Bannerjee and Richard Attenborough.[97] Despite the film\\'s limited budget, The Washington Post critic gave it a positive review; \"He [Ray] possesses what many overindulged Hollywood filmmakers often lack: a view of history\".[98]\\nIn 1980, Ray made a sequel to Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, a somewhat political Hirak Rajar Deshe (Kingdom of Diamonds). The kingdom of the evil Diamond King, or Hirok Raj, is an allusion to India during Indira Gandhi\\'s emergency period.[99] Along with his acclaimed short film Pikoo (Pikoo\\'s Diary) and hour-long Hindi film, Sadgati, this was the culmination of his work in this period.[100]\\nWhen E.T. was released in 1982, Clarke and Ray saw similarities in the film to his earlier The Alien script; Ray claimed that E.T. plagiarised his script. Ray said that Steven Spielberg\\'s film \"would not have been possible without my script of \\'The Alien\\' being available throughout America in mimeographed copies.\" Spielberg denied any plagiarism by saying, \"I was a kid in high school when this script was circulating in Hollywood.\" (Spielberg actually graduated high school in 1965 and released his first film in 1968).[101] Besides The Alien, two other unrealised projects that Ray had intended to direct were adaptations of the ancient Indian epic, the Mahābhārata, and E. M. Forster\\'s 1924 novel A Passage to India.[102]\\nIn 1983, while working on Ghare Baire (Home and the World), Ray suffered a heart attack; it would severely limit his productivity in the remaining nine years of his life. Ghare Baire, an adaptation of the novel of the same name, was completed in 1984 with the help of Ray\\'s son, who served as a camera operator from then onward. It is about the dangers of fervent nationalism; he wrote the first draft of a script for it in the 1940s.[103] Despite rough patches due to Ray\\'s illness, the film did receive some acclaim; critic Vincent Canby gave the film a maximum rating of five stars and praised the performances of the three lead actors.[104] It also featured the first kiss scene portrayed in Ray\\'s films.\\nIn 1987, Ray recovered to an extent to direct the 1990 film Shakha Proshakha (Branches of the Tree).[105] It depicts an old man, who has lived a life of honesty, and learns of the corruption of three of his sons. The final scene shows the father finding solace only in the companionship of his fourth son, who is uncorrupted but mentally ill due to a head injury sustained while he was studying in England.\\nRay\\'s last film, Agantuk (The Stranger), is lighter in mood but not in theme; when a long-lost uncle arrives to visit his niece in Calcutta, he arouses suspicion as to his motive. It provokes far-ranging questions in the film about civilisation.[106] Critic Hal Hinson was impressed, and thought Agantuk shows \"all the virtues of a master artist in full maturity\".[107]\\nA heavy smoker but non-drinker, Ray valued work more than anything else. He would work 12 hours a day, and go to bed at two o\\'clock in the morning. He also enjoyed collecting antiques, manuscripts, rare gramophone records, paintings and rare books.[108] On his religious views, he was an atheist.[109]\\nIn 1992, Ray\\'s health deteriorated due to heart complications. He was admitted to a hospital but never recovered. Twenty-four days before his death, Ray was presented with an Honorary Academy Award by Audrey Hepburn via video-link; he was in gravely ill condition, but gave an acceptance speech, calling it the \"best achievement of [his] movie-making career.\"[110] He died on 23 April 1992, 9 days before his 71st birthday.[111]\\nRay created two popular fictional characters in Bengali children\\'s literature— Pradosh Chandra Mitter (Mitra) alias Feluda, a sleuth, and Professor Shonku, a scientist. The Feluda stories are narrated by Tapesh Ranjan Mitra aka Topshe, his teenage cousin, something of a Watson to Feluda\\'s Holmes. The science fiction stories of Shonku are presented as a diary discovered after the scientist had mysteriously disappeared.\\nRay also wrote a collection of nonsense verse named Today Bandha Ghorar Dim, which includes a translation of Lewis Carroll\\'s \"Jabberwocky\". He wrote a collection of humorous stories of Mullah Nasiruddin in Bengali.[112]\\nHis short stories were published as collections of 12 stories, in which the overall title played with the word twelve (for example Aker pitthe dui, or literally \"Two on top of one\"). Ray\\'s interest in puzzles and puns is reflected in his stories. Ray\\'s short stories give full rein to his interest in the macabre, in suspense and other aspects that he avoided in film, making for an interesting psychological study.[113] Most of his writings have been translated into English. Most of his screenplays have been published in Bengali in the literary journal Eksan. Ray wrote an autobiography about his childhood years, Jakhan Choto Chilam (1982), translated to English as Childhood Days: A Memoir by his wife Bijoya Ray.[114] In 1994, Ray published his memoir, My Years with Apu, about his experiences of making The Apu Trilogy.[115]\\nHe also wrote essays on film, published as the collections: Our Films, Their Films (1976), Bishoy Chalachchitra (1976), and Ekei Bole Shooting (1979). During the mid-1990s, Ray\\'s film essays and an anthology of short stories were also published in English in the West. Our Films, Their Films is an anthology of film criticism by Ray. The book contains articles and personal journal excerpts. The book is presented in two sections: Ray first discusses Indian film, before turning his attention toward Hollywood, specific filmmakers (Charlie Chaplin and Akira Kurosawa), and movements such as Italian neorealism. His book Bishoy Chalachchitra was published in translation in 2006 as Speaking of Films. It contains a compact description of his philosophy of different aspects of the cinemas.[116]\\n\"Project Tiger\" by Ray is both a comedical and a success prose made by him. It deals with a scene in the movie Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne when he needed a tiger in his film which was brought from Bharat circus which was doing shows in then Calcutta; the scene was reshooted both at Shuiri and Boral (The shooting location of the movie Pather Panchali) because of the tiger\\'s behaviour. It ended well at the end as the scene was shot successfully.[117]\\nRay designed four typefaces for roman script named Ray Roman, Ray Bizarre, Daphnis, and Holiday script, apart from numerous Bengali ones for the Sandesh magazine.[118][119] Ray Roman and Ray Bizarre won an international competition in 1971.[120]\\nIn certain circles of Calcutta, Ray continued to be known as an eminent graphic designer, well into his film career. Ray illustrated all his books and designed covers for them, as well as creating all publicity material for his films, for example, Ray\\'s artistic playing with the Bengali graphemes was also revealed in the cine posters and cine promo-brochures\\' covers. He also designed covers of several books by other authors.[121] His calligraphic technique reflects the deep impact of (a) the artistic pattern of European musical staff notation in the graphemic syntagms and (b) alpana (\"ritual painting\" mainly practised by Bengali women at the time of religious festivals (the term denotes \\'to coat with\\'). Generally categorised as \"Folk\"-Art cf. in Ray\\'s graphemes representations.[citation needed]\\nThus, so-called division between classical and folk art is blurred in Ray\\'s representation of Bengali graphemes. The three-tier X-height of Bengali graphemes was presented in a manner of musical map and the contours, curves in between horizontal and vertical meeting-point, follow the patterns of alpana. It is also noticed that the metamorphosis of graphemes (this might be designated as \"Archewriting\") as a living object/subject in Ray\\'s positive manipulation of Bengali graphemes.[122]\\nAs a graphic designer, Ray designed most of his film posters, combining folk art and calligraphy to create themes ranging from mysterious, surreal to comical; an exhibition for his posters was held at British Film Institute in 2013.[123] He would master every style of visual art, and could mimic any painter, as evidenced in his book and magazine covers, posters, literary illustrations and advertisement campaigns.[124]\\nRay had been subconsciously paying a tribute to Jean Renoir throughout his career, who influenced him the most. He also acknowledged Vittorio De Sica, whom he thought represented Italian Neorealism best, and taught him the cramming of cinematic details into a single shot, and using amateur actors and actresses.[125] Ray professed to have learnt the craft of cinema from Old Hollywood directors such as John Ford, Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch. He had deep respect and admiration for his contemporaries Akira Kurosawa and Ingmar Bergman, whom he considered giants.[125] Among others, he learnt the use of freeze frame shots from François Truffaut, and jump cuts, fades and dissolves from Jean-Luc Godard. Although he admired Godard\\'s \"revolutionary\" early phase, he thought his later phase was \"alien\".[89] Ray adored his peer Michelangelo Antonioni, but hated Blowup, which he considered having \"very little inner movement\". He was also impressed with Stanley Kubrick\\'s work.[126] Although Ray stated to have had very little influence from Sergei Eisenstein, films such as Pather Panchali, Aparajito, Charulata and Sadgati contains scenes which show striking uses of montage. He also had sketches of Eisenstein.[124]\\nRay considered script-writing to be an integral part of direction. Initially he refused to make a film in any language other than Bengali. In his two non-Bengali feature films, he wrote the script in English; translators adapted it into Hindustani under Ray\\'s supervision.\\nRay\\'s eye for detail was matched by that of his art director Bansi Chandragupta. His influence on the early films was so important that Ray would always write scripts in English before creating a Bengali version, so that the non-Bengali Chandragupta would be able to read it. Subrata Mitra\\'s cinematography garnered praise in Ray\\'s films, although some critics thought that Mitra\\'s eventual departure from Ray lowered its quality. Mitra stopped working for him after Nayak. Mitra developed \"bounce lighting\", a technique to reflect light from cloth to create a diffused, realistic light even on a set.[127][128]\\nRay\\'s regular film editor was Dulal Datta, but the director usually dictated the editing while Datta did the actual work. Due to finances and Ray\\'s meticulous planning, his films (apart from Pather Panchali) were mostly cut in-camera.\\nAt the beginning of his career, Ray worked with Indian classical musicians, including Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan, and Ali Akbar Khan. He found that their first loyalty was to musical traditions, and not to his film. He obtained a greater understanding of Western classical forms, which he wanted to use for his films set in an urban milieu.[129] Starting with Teen Kanya, Ray began to compose his own scores.[130] Beethoven was Ray\\'s favourite composer; Ray also went on to become a distinguished connoisseur of Western classical music in India.[131] The narrative structure of Ray\\'s films are represented by musical forms such as sonata, fugue and rondo. Kanchenjunga, Nayak and Aranyer Din Ratri are examples of this structure.[131]\\nThe director cast actors from diverse backgrounds, from well-known stars to people who had never seen a film (as in Aparajito).[132] Robin Wood and others have lauded him as the best director of children, recalling memorable performances in the roles of Apu and Durga (Pather Panchali), Ratan (Postmaster) and Mukul (Sonar Kella). Depending on the actor\\'s skill and experience, Ray varied the intensity of his direction, from virtually nothing with actors such as Utpal Dutt, to using the actor as a puppet (Subir Banerjee as young Apu or Sharmila Tagore as Aparna).[133]\\nActors who had worked for Ray trusted him, but said that he could also treat incompetence with total contempt.[134] With admiration of his cinematic style and craft, director Roger Manvell said, \"In the restrained style he has adopted, Ray has become a master of technique. He takes his timing from the nature of the people and their environment; his camera is the intent, unobtrusive observer of reactions; his editing the discreet, economical transition from one value to the next.\"[135] Ray credited life to be the best kind of inspiration for cinema; he said, \"For a popular medium, the best kind of inspiration should derive from life and have its roots in it. No amount of technical polish can make up for artificiality of the theme and the dishonesty of treatment.\"[135]\\nRay\\'s work has been described as full of humanism and universality, and of a deceptive simplicity with deep underlying complexity.[136][137] The Japanese director Akira Kurosawa said, \"Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon.\"[138][139] But his detractors find his films glacially slow, moving like a \"majestic snail.\"[75] Some critics find his work anti-modern; they criticise him for lacking the new modes of expression or experimentation found in works of Ray\\'s contemporaries, such as Jean-Luc Godard.[140] As Stanley Kauffmann wrote, some critics believe that Ray assumes that viewers \"can be interested in a film that simply dwells in its characters, rather than one that imposes dramatic patterns on their lives.\"[141] Ray said he could do nothing about the slow pace. Kurosawa defended him by saying that Ray\\'s films were not slow; \"His work can be described as flowing composedly, like a big river\".[142]\\nCritics have often compared Ray to Anton Chekhov, Jean Renoir, Vittorio De Sica, Howard Hawks and Mozart. The writer V. S. Naipaul compared a scene in Shatranj Ki Khiladi (The Chess Players) to a Shakespearean play; he wrote, \"only three hundred words are spoken but goodness!\\xa0– terrific things happen.\"[64][143][144] Even critics who did not like the aesthetics of Ray\\'s films generally acknowledged his ability to encompass a whole culture with all its nuances. Ray\\'s obituary in The Independent included the question, \"Who else can compete?\"[145]\\nHis work was promoted in France by The Studio des Ursuline cinema. French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson described Ray as\\xa0\"undoubtedly a giant in the film world\".[146] With positive admiration for most of Ray\\'s films, critic Roger Ebert cited The Apu Trilogy among the greatest films.[147] Vincent Canby once wrote about Ray\\'s films \"no matter what the particular story, no matter what the social-political circumstances of the characters, the cinema of Satyajit Ray (the Apu trilogy, The Music Room, Distant Thunder and The Chess Players, among others) is so exquisitely realized that an entire world is evoked from comparatively limited details.\"[148]\\nPraising his contribution to the world of cinema, Martin Scorsese said: \"His work is in the company of that of living contemporaries like Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa and Federico Fellini.\"[149] Francis Ford Coppola cited Ray as a major influence;[150] he praised 1960\\'s Devi,  which Coppola considers as his best work and a \"cinematic milestone\"; Coppola admits to learning Indian cinema through Ray\\'s works.[151] On a trip to India, Christopher Nolan expressed his admiration for Ray\\'s Pather Panchali. Nolan said, \"I have had the pleasure of watching [Satyajit Ray\\'s] Pather Panchali recently, which I hadn\\'t seen before. I think it is one of the best films ever made. It is an extraordinary piece of work.\"[150]\\nPolitics and ego have also influenced debate regarding Ray\\'s work. Certain advocates of socialism claim that Ray was not \"committed\" to the cause of the nation\\'s downtrodden classes while some critics accused him of glorifying poverty in Pather Panchali and Ashani Sanket (Distant Thunder) through lyricism and aesthetics. They said he provided no solution to conflicts in the stories, and was unable to overcome his bourgeois background. During the naxalite movements in the 1970s, agitators once came close to causing physical harm to his son, Sandip.[152]\\nIn early 1980, Ray was criticised by an Indian M.P., and former actress Nargis Dutt, who accused Ray of \"exporting poverty\". She wanted him to make films that represent \"Modern India\".[153] In a highly public exchange of letters during the 1960s, Ray harshly criticised the film Akash Kusum by colleague Mrinal Sen.[154] Ray said that Sen only attacked \"easy targets\", for example the Bengali middle classes. That Akash Kusum bore some resemblance to Parash Pathar, a film Sen had admitted to not liking, may have played a role in fracturing their previously cordial relationship. Ray would continue to make films on this \"easy target\" demographic, including Pratidwandi and Jana Aranya (set during the naxalite movement in Bengal), and the two filmmakers would continue to trade praise and criticism the rest of their careers.\\nRay is a cultural icon in India and in Bengali communities worldwide.[155] Following his death, the city of Calcutta came to a virtual standstill, as hundreds of thousands of people gathered around his house to pay their last respects.[156] Ray\\'s influence has been widespread and deep in Bengali cinema; many Bengali directors, including Aparna Sen, Rituparno Ghosh and Gautam Ghose as well as Vishal Bhardwaj, Dibakar Banerjee, Shyam Benegal and Sujoy Ghosh from Hindi cinema in India, Tareq Masud and Tanvir Mokammel in Bangladesh, and Aneel Ahmad in England, have been influenced by his craft. Across the spectrum, filmmakers such as Budhdhadeb Dasgupta, Mrinal Sen and Adoor Gopalakrishnan have acknowledged his seminal contribution to Indian cinema.[157] Beyond India, filmmakers Martin Scorsese,[158][159] Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas,[160] James Ivory,[161] Abbas Kiarostami, Elia Kazan, William Wyler,[162] François Truffaut,[163] John Huston,[164] Carlos Saura,[165] Isao Takahata,[166] Oliver Stone[167] Quentin Tarantino, Wes Anderson,[168] Danny Boyle[169] Christopher Nolan,[150] and many other international filmmakers have been influenced by Ray\\'s cinematic style.[138]\\nGregory Nava\\'s 1995 film My Family had a final scene that was reminiscent of Apur Sansar. Ira Sachs\\'s 2005 work Forty Shades of Blue was a loose remake of Charulata. Other references to Ray\\'s films are found, for example, in 2006\\'s Sacred Evil,[170] and the Elements trilogy by Deepa Mehta.[171] According to Michael Sragow of The Atlantic Monthly, the \"youthful coming-of-age dramas that have flooded art houses since the mid-fifties owe a tremendous debt to The Apu Trilogy\".[172] Kanchenjungha introduced a narrative structure that resembles later hyperlink cinema.[173] Pratidwandi helped pioneer photo-negative flashback and X-ray digression techniques.[174] Together with Madhabi Mukherjee, Ray was the first Indian film figure to be featured on a foreign stamp (Dominica).\\nIranian filmmaker Majid Majidi has expressed deep admiration for Ray. While discussing the inspiration for his first feature film on India, Beyond the Clouds (2017), Majidi said, \"I have learned a lot about India based on the works of remarkable Indian director Satyajit Ray so it was my dream to make a film in his land. His view point is very valuable to me and I love whatever he has done, so one of the main reasons behind making this film is my admiration for Satyajit Ray and his work\".[175] Wes Anderson said that his 2007 film, The Darjeeling Limited, is dedicated to Ray.[176]\\nMany literary works include references to Ray or his work, including Saul Bellow\\'s Herzog and J. M. Coetzee\\'s Youth. Salman Rushdie\\'s Haroun and the Sea of Stories contains fish characters named Goopy and Bagha, a tribute to Ray\\'s fantasy film. In 1993, University of California, Santa Cruz established the Satyajit Ray Film and Study collection, and in 1995, the Government of India set up Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute for studies related to film. In 2007, the BBC declared that two Feluda stories would be made into radio programs.[177] During the London Film Festival, a regular \"Satyajit Ray Award\" is given to a first-time feature director whose film best captures \"the artistry, compassion and humanity of Ray\\'s vision\".\\nA number of Documentary films have been produced about Ray in India, prominent ones include: Creative Artists of India – Satyajit Ray (1964) by Bhagwan Das Garga and Satyajit Ray (1982) by Shyam Benegal – both backed by the Government of India\\'s Films Division, The Music of Satyajit Ray (1984) by Utpalendu Chakrabarty with funding from the National Film Development Corporation of India, Ray: Life and Work of Satyajit Ray (1999) by Goutam Ghose.[178] In 2016, during the shooting of the film Double Feluda, Satyajit\\'s son, Sandip, filmed his father\\'s famous library.[179]\\nOn 23 February 2021 on the year of Satyajit Ray\\'s birth centenary, the Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar announced that the central government would institute an award in the name of Satyajit Ray.

At the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979, he was awarded with the Honorable Prize for the contribution to cinema.[186] At the Berlin International Film Festival, he was one of only four filmmakers to win the Silver Bear for Best Director more than once and holds the record for the most Golden Bear nominations, with seven.[187] At the Venice Film Festival, where he had previously won a Golden Lion for Aparajito (1956), he was awarded the Golden Lion Honorary Award in 1982. That same year, he received an honorary \"Hommage à Satyajit Ray\" award at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival.[188] Ray is the second film personality after Charlie Chaplin to have been awarded an honorary doctorate by Oxford University.[189]\\nHe was awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1985, and the Legion of Honor by the President of France in 1987.[190][191] The Government of India awarded him the Padma Bhushan in 1965 and the highest civilian honour,[192] Bharat Ratna, shortly before his death.[190] The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Ray an Honorary Award in 1992 for Lifetime Achievement. In 1992, he was posthumously awarded the Akira Kurosawa Award for Lifetime Achievement in Directing at the San Francisco International Film Festival; it was accepted on his behalf by actress Sharmila Tagore.[193]\\nParticipants in a 2004 BBC poll placed him No. 13 on the \"Greatest Bengali of all time\".[194] In 1992, the Sight & Sound Critics\\' Top Ten Poll ranked Ray at No. 7 in its list of \"Top 10 Directors\" of all time, making him the highest-ranking Asian filmmaker in the poll.[195] In 2002, the Sight & Sound critics\\' and directors\\' poll ranked Ray at No. 22 in its list of all-time greatest directors,[196] thus making him the fourth highest-ranking Asian filmmaker in the poll.[196] In 1996, Entertainment Weekly ranked Ray at No. 25 in its \"50 Greatest Directors\" list.[197] In 2007, Total Film magazine included Ray in its \"100 Greatest Film Directors Ever\" list.[198] In 2022, the Sydney Film Festival showcased 10 films by Ray as homage[199] and the BFI Southbank screened a complete retrospective in July.[200]\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nSharadindu Bandyopadhyay (30 March 1899 – 22 September 1970) was an Indian Bengali-language writer.[1] He was actively involved with Bengali cinema as well as Bollywood. The creator of the Bengali detective Byomkesh Bakshi, Sharadindu composed stories of a wide array of varieties including: novels, short stories, crime and detective stories, plays and screenplays. He wrote historical fiction like Kaler Mandira, Gourmollar (initially named as Mouri Nodir Teere), Tumi Sandhyar Megh, Tungabhadrar Teere, Chuya-Chandan, Maru O Sangha (later made into a Hindi film named Trishagni), Sadashib series and stories of the unnatural with the recurring character Baroda. Besides, he composed many songs and poems.[2]\\nHe was born to Tarabhushan and Bijaliprabha Bandyopadhyay at his maternal grandparents' home in Jaunpur, United Province, India on 30 March 1899. The Bandyopadhyay  family's residence was at Purnia, Bihar, India, where his father worked but the family originally hailed from Baranagar, North Kolkata, West Bengal, India.[3][4] He completed his matriculation in 1915 from a school in Munger. He wrote his first story 'Pretpuri', a Boroda story, when he was only 15 years. After matriculation, he joined the Vidyasagar College, Kolkata. Sisir Bhaduri, the doyen of Bengali stage, was his English professor there. After completing graduation, he went on to study law in Patna. He was only thirty years old when he gave up his practice and started working as a writer. In 1928, Himangshu Roy invited him to Bombay to write screenplays. Till 1952 he wrote films, and then settled down in Pune to pursue a full-fledged career as a writer.[5]\\nByomkesh Bakshi is a detective who calls himself Satyanweshi or the truth-seeker. He is known for his proficiency with observation, logical reasoning, and forensic science which he uses to solve complicated cases, usually murders.\\nBoroda is a ghost-chaser, obsessed with life-after death and in writer's words Bhootanweshi. Like the Mejokorta of Premendra Mitra, he has direct interactions with ghosts.  He recounts his many encounters with spirits much to the chagrin of his friends. In Byomkesh O Boroda, the two characters met each other.  This series of short stories provide great examples of spine-chilling atmosphere and last-minute twists. The list of stories in chronological order:-\\nSadashib,[a] or Sadashib Rao, is a fictional character of a young lad starring in a series of short stories of Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay. The protagonist of the series Sadashib is a Maratha soldier hailing from the village Dongarhpur. This character was created with the backdrop of 16th century Maharashtra when the Maratha-Adil Shah-Mughal antipathy was at its pinnacle. The conflict of Chhatrapati Shivaji and Aurangzeb provided the series with its own distinctive plot.[6][7]\\nAs per the pretext of the series, the Mughals were residing on Daulatabad north of Maharashtra and Sultan Adil Shah was in the charge of Bijapur fort in the south. Although at the time of the story's beginning the forces of Shivaji had not yet earned the total trust of entire mass, they were on the rise to end the daily oppression of the simple villagers and the common people in the hands of the tyrant rulers. During this time Sadashib, an orphan boy of around seventeen to eighteen was growing up in his maternal uncle's house in the village Dongarhpur with his uncle and aunt who strongly despised him. One day, his maternal uncle Sakharam decides to throw him out of his home after consulting with the villages head and other elders citing the reason that he is unable to provide sustenance to his household in the time of war and crisis. Sadashiv, who has nobody in the village to turn to leaves, but his friend Kumkum, the daughter of village elder Biththal Patil, advises him to go and join Shivaji's troops. Later, Kumkum helps him escape on the ailing horse of her father. Sadashiv sets course for Puna,[b] but he encounters Shivaji's forces en route, eventually helps them unknowingly. They take him to Torna, where Shivaji was camping and he joins Shivaji's force and gets popular by the day on the merit of his young as well as cunning stature. In the passage of time, he becomes the go-to-man of Shivaji and helps to tide him over of different problems.[8][9]\\nSadashib er Ghora Ghora kando\\nSource: Dey, Anindita (2021)[9]\\nSharadindu Bandyopadhyay was advised and motivated to write about Shivaji through the view of a young soldier by his friend and fellow author, Rajshekhar Basu.

Who can create that atmosphere, who else has the wit and humour…his prose had a different taste altogether – I am rather fond of it....’ that's what Sunil Gangopadhyay said about Saradindu Bandopadhyay regarding his historical novels and stories.  Set in different periods of Indian history, right from the Pre-Aryan days to the Gupta, Mauryan era till the age of the Mughals – they are a unique blend of scintillating twists and turns, of romance, adventure and revenge, characters brought to life by a unique idiom and vocabulary to suit the ethos of that bygone era.\\nSaradindu himself said – 'My stories are not fictionalised history, they are historical fiction.[17] Since the writer spent the latter half of his life in Maharashtra, Pune and the Western Ghats form a picturesque backdrop to quite a few of his stories, many of which narrate tales of the Maratha hero, Chhatrapati Shivaji.\\nSocial:\\nDadar Kirti [দাদার কীর্তি]\\nScreenplay:\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nSherlock Holmes (/ˈʃɜːlɒk ˈhoʊmz/) is a fictional detective created by British author Arthur Conan Doyle. Referring to himself as a \"consulting detective\" in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, deduction, forensic science and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.\\nThe character Sherlock Holmes first appeared in print in 1887\\'s A Study in Scarlet. His popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one[a] are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes\\'s friend and biographer Dr. John H. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin.\\nThough not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known.[1] By the 1990s, there were already over 25,000 stage adaptations, films, television productions and publications featuring the detective,[2] and Guinness World Records lists him as the most portrayed human literary character in film and television history.[3] Holmes\\'s popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual;[4][5][6] numerous literary and fan societies have been founded on this pretence. Avid readers of the Holmes stories helped create the modern practice of fandom.[7] The character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales as well as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.\\nEdgar Allan Poe\\'s C. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in fiction and served as the prototype for many later characters, including Holmes.[8] Conan Doyle once wrote, \"Each [of Poe\\'s detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed\\xa0... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\"[9] Similarly, the stories of Émile Gaboriau\\'s Monsieur Lecoq were extremely popular at the time Conan Doyle began writing Holmes, and Holmes\\'s speech and behaviour sometimes follow those of Lecoq.[10][11] Doyle has his main characters discuss these literary antecedents near the beginning of A Study in Scarlet, which is set soon after Watson is first introduced to Holmes. Watson attempts to compliment Holmes by comparing him to Dupin, to which Holmes replies that he found Dupin to be \"a very inferior fellow\" and Lecoq to be \"a miserable bungler\".[12]\\nConan Doyle repeatedly said that Holmes was inspired by the real-life figure of Joseph Bell, a surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, whom Conan Doyle met in 1877 and had worked for as a clerk. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing broad conclusions from minute observations.[13] However, he later wrote to Conan Doyle: \"You are yourself Sherlock Holmes and well you know it\".[14] Sir Henry Littlejohn, Chair of Medical Jurisprudence at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, is also cited as an inspiration for Holmes. Littlejohn, who was also Police Surgeon and Medical Officer of Health in Edinburgh, provided Conan Doyle with a link between medical investigation and the detection of crime.[15]\\nOther possible inspirations have been proposed, though never acknowledged by Doyle, such as Maximilien Heller, by French author Henry Cauvain. In this 1871 novel (sixteen years before the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes), Henry Cauvain imagined a depressed, anti-social, opium-smoking polymath detective, operating in Paris.[16][17][18] It is not known if Conan Doyle read the novel, but he was fluent in French.[19] Similarly, Michael Harrison suggested that a German self-styled \"consulting detective\" named Walter Scherer may have been the model for Holmes.[20]\\nDetails of Sherlock Holmes\\'s life in Conan Doyle\\'s stories are scarce and often vague. Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.\\nA statement of Holmes\\'s age in \"His Last Bow\" places his year of birth at 1854; the story, set in August 1914, describes him as sixty years of age.[21] His parents are not mentioned, although Holmes mentions that his \"ancestors\" were \"country squires\". In \"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\", he claims that his grandmother was sister to the French artist Vernet, without clarifying whether this was Claude Joseph, Carle, or Horace Vernet. Holmes\\'s brother Mycroft, seven years his senior, is a government official. Mycroft has a unique civil service position as a kind of human database for all aspects of government policy. Sherlock describes his brother as the more intelligent of the two, but notes that Mycroft lacks any interest in physical investigation, preferring to spend his time at the Diogenes Club.[22][23]\\nHolmes says that he first developed his methods of deduction as an undergraduate; his earliest cases, which he pursued as an amateur, came from fellow university students.[24] A meeting with a classmate\\'s father led him to adopt detection as a profession.[25]\\nIn the first Holmes tale, A Study in Scarlet, financial difficulties lead Holmes and Dr. Watson to share rooms together at 221B Baker Street, London.[26] Their residence is maintained by their landlady, Mrs. Hudson.[27] Holmes works as a detective for twenty-three years, with Watson assisting him for seventeen of those years.[28] Most of the stories are frame narratives written from Watson\\'s point of view, as summaries of the detective\\'s most interesting cases. Holmes frequently calls Watson\\'s records of Holmes\\'s cases sensational and populist, suggesting that they fail to accurately and objectively report the \"science\" of his craft:\\nDetection is, or ought to be, an exact science and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it [A Study in Scarlet] with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid. ... Some facts should be suppressed, or, at least, a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes, by which I succeeded in unravelling it.[29]Nevertheless, when Holmes recorded a case himself, he was forced to concede that he could more easily understand the need to write it in a manner that would appeal to the public rather than his intention to focus on his own technical skill.[30]\\nHolmes\\'s friendship with Watson is his most significant relationship. When Watson is injured by a bullet, although the wound turns out to be \"quite superficial\", Watson is moved by Holmes\\'s reaction:\\nIt was worth a wound; it was worth many wounds; to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation.[31]After confirming Watson\\'s assessment of the wound, Holmes makes it clear to their opponent that the man would not have left the room alive if he genuinely had killed Watson.[31]\\nHolmes\\'s clients vary from the most powerful monarchs and governments of Europe, to wealthy aristocrats and industrialists, to impoverished pawnbrokers and governesses. He is known only in select professional circles at the beginning of the first story, but is already collaborating with Scotland Yard. However, his continued work and the publication of Watson\\'s stories raise Holmes\\'s profile, and he rapidly becomes well known as a detective; so many clients ask for his help instead of (or in addition to) that of the police[32] that, Watson writes, by 1887 \"Europe was ringing with his name\"[33] and by 1895 Holmes has \"an immense practice\".[34] Police outside London ask Holmes for assistance if he is nearby.[35] A Prime Minister[36] and the King of Bohemia[37] visit 221B Baker Street in person to request Holmes\\'s assistance; the President of France awards him the Legion of Honour for capturing an assassin;[38] the King of Scandinavia is a client;[39] and he aids the Vatican at least twice.[40] The detective acts on behalf of the British government in matters of national security several times[41] and declines a knighthood \"for services which may perhaps some day be described\".[42] However, he does not actively seek fame and is usually content to let the police take public credit for his work.[43]\\nThe first set of Holmes stories was published between 1887 and 1893. Conan Doyle killed off Holmes in a final battle with the criminal mastermind Professor James Moriarty[44] in \"The Final Problem\" (published 1893, but set in 1891), as Conan Doyle felt that \"my literary energies should not be directed too much into one channel.\"[45] However, the reaction of the public surprised Doyle very much. Distressed readers wrote anguished letters to The Strand Magazine, which suffered a terrible blow when 20,000 people cancelled their subscriptions to the magazine in protest.[46] Conan Doyle himself received many protest letters, and one lady even began her letter with \"You brute\".[46] Legend has it that Londoners were so distraught upon hearing the news of Holmes\\'s death that they wore black armbands in mourning, though there is no known contemporary source for this; the earliest known reference to such events comes from 1949.[47] However, the recorded public reaction to Holmes\\'s death was unlike anything previously seen for fictional events.[7]\\nAfter resisting public pressure for eight years, Conan Doyle wrote The Hound of the Baskervilles (serialised in 1901–02, with an implicit setting before Holmes\\'s death). In 1903, Conan Doyle wrote \"The Adventure of the Empty House\"; set in 1894, Holmes reappears, explaining to a stunned Watson that he had faked his death to fool his enemies.[48] Following \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", Conan Doyle would sporadically write new Holmes stories until 1927.\\nHolmes aficionados refer to the period from 1891 to 1894—between his disappearance and presumed death in \"The Final Problem\" and his reappearance in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\"—as the Great Hiatus.[49] The earliest known use of this expression dates to 1946.[50]\\nIn His Last Bow, the reader is told that Holmes has retired to a small farm on the Sussex Downs and taken up beekeeping as his primary occupation.[51] The move is not dated precisely, but can be presumed to be no later than 1904 (since it is referred to retrospectively in \"The Adventure of the Second Stain\", first published that year).[52] The story features Holmes and Watson coming out of retirement to aid the British war effort. Only one other adventure, \"The Adventure of the Lion\\'s Mane\", takes place during the detective\\'s retirement.[53]\\nWatson describes Holmes as \"bohemian\" in his habits and lifestyle.[54] Said to have a \"cat-like\" love of personal cleanliness,[55] at the same time Holmes is an eccentric with no regard for contemporary standards of tidiness or good order. Watson describes him as\\nin his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. [He] keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece. ... He had a horror of destroying documents.... Thus month after month his papers accumulated, until every corner of the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were on no account to be burned, and which could not be put away save by their owner.[56]While Holmes can be dispassionate and cold, during an investigation he is animated and excitable. He has a flair for showmanship, often keeping his methods and evidence hidden until the last possible moment so as to impress observers.[57] His companion condones the detective\\'s willingness to bend the truth (or break the law) on behalf of a client—lying to the police, concealing evidence or breaking into houses—when he feels it morally justifiable.[58]\\nExcept for that of Watson, Holmes avoids casual company. In \"The Gloria Scott\", he tells the doctor that during two years at college he made only one friend: \"I was never a very sociable fellow, Watson ... I never mixed much with the men of my year.\"[59] The detective goes without food at times of intense intellectual activity, believing that \"the faculties become refined when you starve them.\"[60][61] At times, Holmes relaxes with music, either playing the violin[62] or enjoying the works of composers such as Wagner[63] and Pablo de Sarasate.[64]\\nHolmes occasionally uses addictive drugs, especially in the absence of stimulating cases.[65] He sometimes used morphine and sometimes cocaine, the latter of which he injects in a seven-per cent solution; both drugs were legal in 19th-century England.[66][67][68] As a physician, Watson strongly disapproves of his friend\\'s cocaine habit, describing it as the detective\\'s only vice, and concerned about its effect on Holmes\\'s mental health and intellect.[69][70] In \"The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\", Watson says that although he has \"weaned\" Holmes from drugs, the detective remains an addict whose habit is \"not dead, but merely sleeping\".[71]\\nWatson and Holmes both use tobacco, smoking cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. Although his chronicler does not consider Holmes\\'s smoking a vice per se, Watson—a physician—does criticise the detective for creating a \"poisonous atmosphere\" in their confined quarters.[72][73]\\nHolmes is known to charge clients for his expenses and claim any reward offered for a problem\\'s solution, such as in \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\", \"The Red-Headed League\", and \"The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\". The detective states at one point that \"My professional charges are upon a fixed scale. I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether.\" In this context, a client is offering to double his fee, and it is implied that wealthy clients habitually pay Holmes more than his standard rate.[74] In \"The Adventure of the Priory School\", Holmes earns a £6,000 fee[75] (at a time where annual expenses for a rising young professional were in the area of £500).[76] However, Watson notes that Holmes would refuse to help even the wealthy and powerful if their cases did not interest him.[77]\\nAs Conan Doyle wrote to Joseph Bell, \"Holmes is as inhuman as a Babbage\\'s Calculating Machine and just about as likely to fall in love.\"[78] Holmes says of himself that he is \"not a whole-souled admirer of womankind\",[79] and that he finds \"the motives of women ... inscrutable. ... How can you build on such quicksand? Their most trivial actions may mean volumes...\"[80] In The Sign of Four, he says, \"Women are never to be entirely trusted—not the best of them\", a feeling Watson notes as an \"atrocious sentiment.\"[81] In \"The Adventure of the Lion\\'s Mane\", Holmes writes, \"Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart.\"[82] At the end of The Sign of Four, Holmes states that \"love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true, cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgement.\"[83] Ultimately, Holmes claims outright that \"I have never loved.\"[84]\\nBut while Watson says that the detective has an \"aversion to women\",[85] he also notes Holmes as having \"a peculiarly ingratiating way with [them]\".[86] Watson notes that their housekeeper Mrs. Hudson is fond of Holmes because of his \"remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women. He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he was always a chivalrous opponent.\"[87] However, in \"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\", the detective becomes engaged under false pretenses in order to obtain information about a case, abandoning the woman once he has the information he requires.[88]\\nIrene Adler is a retired American opera singer and actress who appears in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\". Although this is her only appearance, she is one of only a handful of people who best Holmes in a battle of wits, and the only woman. For this reason, Adler is the frequent subject of pastiche writing.[89] The beginning of the story describes the high regard in which Holmes holds her:\\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. ... And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.[90]Five years before the story\\'s events, Adler had a brief liaison with Crown Prince of Bohemia Wilhelm von Ormstein. As the story opens, the Prince is engaged to another. Fearful that the marriage would be called off if his fiancée\\'s family learns of this past impropriety, Ormstein hires Holmes to regain a photograph of Adler and himself. Adler slips away before Holmes can succeed. Her memory is kept alive by the photograph of Adler that Holmes received for his part in the case.[91]\\nShortly after meeting Holmes in the first story, A Study in Scarlet (generally assumed to be 1881, though the exact date is not given), Watson assesses the detective\\'s abilities:\\nIn A Study in Scarlet, Holmes claims to be unaware that the Earth revolves around the Sun since such information is irrelevant to his work; after hearing that fact from Watson, he says he will immediately try to forget it. The detective believes that the mind has a finite capacity for information storage, and learning useless things reduces one\\'s ability to learn useful things.[93] The later stories move away from this notion: in The Valley of Fear, he says, \"All knowledge comes useful to the detective\",[94] and in \"The Adventure of the Lion\\'s Mane\", the detective calls himself \"an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles\".[95] Looking back on the development of the character in 1912, Conan Doyle wrote that \"In the first one, the Study in Scarlet, [Holmes] was a mere calculating machine, but I had to make him more of an educated human being as I went on with him.\"[96]\\nDespite Holmes\\'s supposed ignorance of politics, in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" he immediately recognises the true identity of the disguised \"Count von Kramm\".[37] At the end of A Study in Scarlet, Holmes demonstrates a knowledge of Latin.[97] The detective cites Hafez,[98] Goethe,[99] as well as a letter from Gustave Flaubert to George Sand in the original French.[100] In The Hound of the Baskervilles, the detective recognises works by Godfrey Kneller and Joshua Reynolds: \"Watson won\\'t allow that I know anything of art, but that is mere jealousy since our views upon the subject differ.\"[101] In \"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\", Watson says that \"Holmes lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus\", considered \"the last word\" on the subject—which must have been the result of an intensive and very specialized musicological study which could have had no possible application to the solution of criminal mysteries.[102][103]\\nHolmes is a cryptanalyst, telling Watson that \"I am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writing, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject, in which I analyse one hundred and sixty separate ciphers.\"[104] Holmes also demonstrates a knowledge of psychology in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", luring Irene Adler into betraying where she hid a photograph based on the premise that a woman will rush to save her most valued possession from a fire.[105] Another example is in \"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\", where Holmes obtains information from a salesman with a wager: \"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the \\'Pink \\'un\\' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet\\xa0.... I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager.\"[106]\\nMaria Konnikova points out in an interview with D. J. Grothe that Holmes practises what is now called mindfulness, concentrating on one thing at a time, and almost never \"multitasks\". She adds that in this he predates the science showing how helpful this is to the brain.[107]\\nHolmes observes the dress and attitude of his clients and suspects, noting skin marks (such as tattoos), contamination (such as ink stains or clay on boots), emotional state, and physical condition in order to deduce their origins and recent history. The style and state of wear of a person\\'s clothes and personal items are also commonly relied on; in the stories, Holmes is seen applying his method to items such as walking sticks,[108] pipes,[109] and hats.[110] For example, in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", Holmes infers that Watson had got wet lately and had \"a most clumsy and careless servant girl.\" When Watson asks how Holmes knows this, the detective answers:\\nIt is simplicity itself\\xa0... my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey.[111]In the first Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet, Dr. Watson compares Holmes to C. Auguste Dupin, Edgar Allan Poe\\'s fictional detective, who employed a similar methodology. Alluding to an episode in \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\", where Dupin determines what his friend is thinking despite their having walked together in silence for a quarter of an hour, Holmes remarks: \"That trick of his breaking in on his friend\\'s thoughts with an apropos remark... is really very showy and superficial.\"[112] Nevertheless, Holmes later performs the same \\'trick\\' on Watson in \"The Cardboard Box\"[113] and \"The Adventure of the Dancing Men\".[114]\\nThough the stories always refer to Holmes\\'s intellectual detection method as \"deduction\", Holmes primarily relies on abduction: inferring an explanation for observed details.[115][116][117] \"From a drop of water,\" he writes, \"a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other.\"[118] However, Holmes does employ deductive reasoning as well. The detective\\'s guiding principle, as he says in The Sign of Four, is: \"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\"[119]\\nDespite Holmes\\'s remarkable reasoning abilities, Conan Doyle still paints him as fallible in this regard (this being a central theme of \"The Yellow Face\").[120]\\nThough Holmes is famed for his reasoning capabilities, his investigative technique relies heavily on the acquisition of hard evidence. Many of the techniques he employs in the stories were at the time in their infancy.[121][122]\\nThe detective is particularly skilled in the analysis of trace evidence and other physical evidence, including latent prints (such as footprints, hoof prints, and shoe and tire impressions) to identify actions at a crime scene,[123] using tobacco ashes and cigarette butts to identify criminals,[124] utilizing handwriting analysis and graphology,[125] comparing typewritten letters to expose a fraud,[126] using gunpowder residue to expose two murderers,[127] and analyzing small pieces of human remains to expose two murders.[128]\\nBecause of the small scale of much of his evidence, the detective often uses a magnifying glass at the scene and an optical microscope at his Baker Street lodgings. He uses analytical chemistry for blood residue analysis and toxicology to detect poisons; Holmes\\'s home chemistry laboratory is mentioned in \"The Naval Treaty\".[129] Ballistics feature in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" when spent bullets are recovered to be matched with a suspected murder weapon, a practice which became regular police procedure only some fifteen years after the story was published.[130]\\nLaura J. Snyder has examined Holmes\\'s methods in the context of mid- to late-19th-century criminology, demonstrating that, while sometimes in advance of what official investigative departments were formally using at the time, they were based upon existing methods and techniques. For example, fingerprints were proposed to be distinct in Conan Doyle\\'s day, and while Holmes used a thumbprint to solve a crime in \"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder\" (generally held to be set in 1895), the story was published in 1903, two years after Scotland Yard\\'s fingerprint bureau opened.[122][131] Though the effect of the Holmes stories on the development of forensic science has thus often been overstated, Holmes inspired future generations of forensic scientists to think scientifically and analytically.[132]\\nHolmes displays a strong aptitude for acting and disguise. In several stories (\"The Sign of Four\", \"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\", \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\", \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" and \"A Scandal in Bohemia\"), to gather evidence undercover, he uses disguises so convincing that Watson fails to recognise him. In others (\"The Adventure of the Dying Detective\" and \"A Scandal in Bohemia\"), Holmes feigns injury or illness to incriminate the guilty. In the latter story, Watson says, \"The stage lost a fine actor\\xa0... when [Holmes] became a specialist in crime.\"[133]\\nGuy Mankowski has said of Holmes that his ability to change his appearance to blend into any situation \"helped him personify the idea of the English eccentric chameleon, in a way that prefigured the likes of David Bowie.\"[134]\\nUntil Watson\\'s arrival at Baker Street, Holmes largely worked alone, only occasionally employing agents from the city\\'s underclass. These agents included a variety of informants, such as Langdale Pike, a \"human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal\",[135] and Shinwell Johnson, who acted as Holmes\\'s \"agent in the huge criminal underworld of London\".[136] The best known of Holmes\\'s agents are a group of street children he called \"the Baker Street Irregulars\".[137][138]\\nHolmes and Watson often carry pistols with them to confront criminals—in Watson\\'s case, his old service weapon (probably a Mark III Adams revolver, issued to British troops during the 1870s).[139] Holmes and Watson shoot the eponymous hound in The Hound of the Baskervilles,[140] and in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", Watson pistol-whips Colonel Sebastian Moran.[141] In \"The Problem of Thor Bridge\", Holmes uses Watson\\'s revolver to solve the case through an experiment.\\nAs a gentleman, Holmes often carries a stick or cane. He is described by Watson as an expert at singlestick,[92] and uses his cane twice as a weapon.[142] In A Study in Scarlet, Watson describes Holmes as an expert swordsman,[92] and in \"The Gloria Scott\", the detective says he practised fencing while at university.[59] In several stories (\"A Case of Identity\", \"The Red-Headed League\", \"The Adventure of the Six Napoleons\"), Holmes wields a riding crop, described in the latter story as his \"favourite weapon\".[143]\\nThe detective is described (or demonstrated) as possessing above-average physical strength. In \"The Yellow Face\", Holmes\\'s chronicler says, \"Few men were capable of greater muscular effort.\"[144] In \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\", Dr. Roylott demonstrates his strength by bending a fire poker in half. Watson describes Holmes as laughing and saying, \"\\'If he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.\\' As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\"[145]\\nHolmes is an adept bare-knuckle fighter; \"The Gloria Scott\" mentions that Holmes boxed while at university.[59] In The Sign of Four, he introduces himself to McMurdo, a prize fighter, as \"the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison\\'s rooms on the night of your benefit four years back.\" McMurdo remembers: \"Ah, you\\'re one that has wasted your gifts, you have! You might have aimed high if you had joined the fancy.\"[146] In \"The Yellow Face\", Watson says: \"He was undoubtedly one of the finest boxers of his weight that I have ever seen.\"[147] In \"The Solitary Cyclist\", Holmes visits a country pub to make enquiries regarding a certain Mr Woodley which resulted in violence. Mr Woodley, Holmes tells Watson,[148]\\n...had been drinking his beer in the tap-room, and had heard the whole conversation. Who was I? What did I want? What did I mean by asking questions? He had a fine flow of language, and his adjectives were very vigorous. He ended a string of abuse by a vicious backhander, which I failed to entirely avoid. The next few minutes were delicious. It was a straight left against a slogging ruffian. I emerged as you see me. Mr. Woodley went home in a cart.[148]Another character subsequently refers to Mr Woodley as looking \"much disfigured\" as a result of his encounter with Holmes.[149]\\nIn \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", Holmes tells Watson that he used a Japanese martial art known as baritsu to fling Moriarty to his death in the Reichenbach Falls.[150] \"Baritsu\" is Conan Doyle\\'s version of bartitsu, which combines jujitsu with boxing and cane fencing.[151]\\nThe first two Sherlock Holmes stories, the novels A Study in Scarlet (1887) and The Sign of the Four (1890), were moderately well received, but Holmes first became very popular early in 1891 when the first six short stories featuring the character were published in The Strand Magazine. Holmes became widely known in Britain and America.[1] The character was so well known that in 1893 when Arthur Conan Doyle killed Holmes in the short story \"The Final Problem\", the strongly negative response from readers was unlike any previous public reaction to a fictional event. The Strand reportedly lost more than 20,000 subscribers as a result of Holmes\\'s death. Public pressure eventually contributed to Conan Doyle writing another Holmes story in 1901 and resurrecting the character in a story published in 1903.[7] In Japan, Sherlock Holmes (and Alice from Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland) became immensely popular in the country in the 1890s as it was opening up to the West, and they are cited as two British fictional Victorians who left an enormous creative and cultural legacy there.[152]\\nMany fans of Sherlock Holmes have written letters to Holmes\\'s address, 221B Baker Street. Though the address 221B Baker Street did not exist when the stories were first published, letters began arriving to the large Abbey National building which first encompassed that address almost as soon as it was built in 1932. Fans continue to send letters to Sherlock Holmes;[153] these letters are now delivered to the Sherlock Holmes Museum.[154] Some of the people who have sent letters to 221B Baker Street believe Holmes is real.[4] Members of the general public have also believed Holmes actually existed. In a 2008 survey of British teenagers, 58 per cent of respondents believed that Sherlock Holmes was a real individual.[5]\\nThe Sherlock Holmes stories continue to be widely read.[1] Holmes\\'s continuing popularity has led to many reimaginings of the character in adaptations.[7] Guinness World Records, which awarded Sherlock Holmes the title for \"most portrayed literary human character in film & TV\" in 2012, released a statement saying that the title \"reflects his enduring appeal and demonstrates that his detective talents are as compelling today as they were 125 years ago.\"[3]\\nThe London Metropolitan Railway named one of its twenty electric locomotives deployed in the 1920s for Sherlock Holmes. He was the only fictional character so honoured, along with eminent Britons such as Lord Byron, Benjamin Disraeli, and Florence Nightingale.[155]\\nA number of London streets are associated with Holmes. York Mews South, off Crawford Street, was renamed Sherlock Mews, and Watson\\'s Mews is near Crawford Place.[156] The Sherlock Holmes is a public house in Northumberland Street in London which contains a large collection of memorabilia related to Holmes, the original collection having been put together for display in Baker Street during the Festival of Britain in 1951.[157][158]\\nIn 2002, the Royal Society of Chemistry bestowed an honorary fellowship on Holmes for his use of forensic science and analytical chemistry in popular literature, making him (as of 2019) the only fictional character thus honoured.[159] Holmes has been commemorated numerous times on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail, most recently in their August 2020 series to celebrate the Sherlock television series.[160]\\nThere are multiple statues of Sherlock Holmes around the world. The first, sculpted by John Doubleday, was unveiled in Meiringen, Switzerland, in September 1988. The second was unveiled in October 1988 in Karuizawa, Japan, and was sculpted by Yoshinori Satoh. The third was installed in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1989, and was sculpted by Gerald Laing.[161] In 1999, a statue of Sherlock Holmes in London, also by John Doubleday, was unveiled near the fictional detective\\'s address, 221B Baker Street.[162] In 2001, a sculpture of Holmes and Arthur Conan Doyle by Irena Sedlecká was unveiled in a statue collection in Warwickshire, England.[163] A sculpture depicting both Holmes and Watson was unveiled in 2007 in Moscow, Russia, based partially on Sidney Paget\\'s illustrations and partially on the actors in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.[164] In 2015, a sculpture of Holmes by Jane DeDecker was installed in the police headquarters of Edmond, Oklahoma, United States.[165] In 2019, a statue of Holmes was unveiled in Chester, Illinois, United States, as part of a series of statues honouring cartoonist E. C. Segar and his characters. The statue is titled \"Sherlock & Segar\", and the face of the statue was modelled on Segar.[166]\\nIn 1934, the Sherlock Holmes Society (in London) and the Baker Street Irregulars (in New York) were founded. The latter is still active. The Sherlock Holmes Society was dissolved later in the 1930s, but was succeeded by a society with a slightly different name, the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, which was founded in 1951 and remains active.[167][168] These societies were followed by many more, first in the U.S. (where they are known as \"scion societies\"—offshoots—of the Baker Street Irregulars) and then in England and Denmark. There are at least 250 societies worldwide, including Australia, Canada (such as The Bootmakers of Toronto), India, and Japan.[169] Fans tend to be called \"Holmesians\" in the U.K. and \"Sherlockians\" in the U.S.,[170][171][172] though recently \"Sherlockian\" has also come to refer to fans of the Benedict Cumberbatch-led BBC series regardless of location.[173]\\nAlthough Holmes is not the original fictional detective, his name has become synonymous with the role. Doyle\\'s Sherlock Holmes stories introduced multiple literary devices that have become major conventions in detective fiction, such as the companion character who is not as clever as the detective and has solutions explained to him (thus informing the reader as well), as with Dr. Watson in the Holmes stories. Other conventions introduced by Doyle include the arch-criminal who is too clever for the official police to defeat, like Holmes\\'s adversary Professor Moriarty, and the use of forensic science to solve cases.[1]\\nThe Sherlock Holmes stories established crime fiction as a respectable genre popular with readers of all backgrounds, and Doyle\\'s success inspired many contemporary detective stories.[174] Holmes influenced the creation of other \"eccentric gentleman detective\" characters, like Agatha Christie\\'s fictional detective Hercule Poirot, introduced in 1920.[175] Holmes also inspired a number of anti-hero characters \"almost as an antidote to the masterful detective\", such as the gentleman thief characters A. J. Raffles (created by E. W. Hornung in 1898) and Arsène Lupin (created by Maurice Leblanc in 1905).[174]\\nThe phrase \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" has become one of the most quoted and iconic aspects of the character. However, although Holmes often observes that his conclusions are \"elementary\", and occasionally calls Watson \"my dear Watson\", the phrase \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" is never uttered in any of the sixty stories by Conan Doyle.[176] One of the nearest approximations of the phrase appears in \"The Adventure of the Crooked Man\" (1893) when Holmes explains a deduction: \"\\'Excellent!\\' I cried. \\'Elementary,\\' said he.\"[177][178]\\nWilliam Gillette is widely considered to have originated the phrase with the formulation, \"Oh, this is elementary, my dear fellow\", allegedly in his 1899 play Sherlock Holmes. However, the script was revised numerous times over the course of some three decades of revivals and publications, and the phrase is present in some versions of the script, but not others.[176] The appearance of the line \"Elementary, my dear Potson\" in a Sherlock Holmes parody from 1901 has led some authors to speculate that, rather than this being an incidental formulation, the parodist drew upon an already well-established occurrences of \"Elementary, my dear Watson.\"[179][180]\\nThe exact phrase, as well as close variants, can be seen in newspaper and journal articles as early as 1909.[176][181] It was also used by P. G. Wodehouse in his novel Psmith, Journalist, which was first serialised in The Captain magazine between October 1909 and February 1910; the phrase occurred in the January 1910 instalment. The phrase became familiar with the American public in part due to its use in the Rathbone-Bruce series of films from 1939 to 1946.[182]\\nConan Doyle\\'s 56 short stories and four novels are known as the \"canon\" by Holmes aficionados. The Great Game (also known as the Holmesian Game, the Sherlockian Game, or simply the Game, also the Higher Criticism) applies the methods of literary and especially Biblical criticism to the canon, operating on the pretense that Holmes and Watson were real people and that Conan Doyle was not the author of the stories but Watson\\'s literary agent. From this basis, it attempts to resolve or explain away contradictions in the canon—such as the location of Watson\\'s war wound, described as being in his shoulder in A Study in Scarlet and in his leg in The Sign of Four—and clarify details about Holmes, Watson and their world, such as the exact dates of events in the stories, combining historical research with references from the stories to construct scholarly analyses.[183][184][185]\\nFor example, one detail analyzed in the Game is Holmes\\'s birth date. The chronology of the stories is notoriously difficult, with many stories lacking dates and many others containing contradictory ones. Christopher Morley and William Baring-Gould contend that the detective was born on 6 January 1854, the year being derived from the statement in \"His Last Bow\" that he was 60 years of age in 1914, while the precise day is derived from broader, non-canonical speculation.[186] This is the date the Baker Street Irregulars work from, with their annual dinner being held each January.[187][188] Laurie R. King instead argues that details in \"The Gloria Scott\" (a story with no precise internal date) indicate that Holmes finished his second (and final) year of university in 1880 or 1885. If he began university at age 17, his birth year could be as late as 1868.[189]\\nFor the 1951 Festival of Britain, Holmes\\'s living room was reconstructed as part of a Sherlock Holmes exhibition, with a collection of original material. After the festival, items were transferred to The Sherlock Holmes (a London pub) and the Conan Doyle collection housed in Lucens, Switzerland, by the author\\'s son, Adrian. Both exhibitions, each with a Baker Street sitting-room reconstruction, are open to the public.[190]\\nIn 1969, the Toronto Reference Library began a collection of materials related to Conan Doyle. Stored today in Room 221B, this vast collection is accessible to the public.[191][192] Similarly, in 1974 the University of Minnesota founded a collection that is now \"the world\\'s largest gathering of material related to Sherlock Holmes and his creator\". Access is closed to the general public, but is occasionally open to tours.[193][194]\\nIn 1990, the Sherlock Holmes Museum opened on Baker Street in London, followed the next year by a museum in Meiringen (near the Reichenbach Falls) dedicated to the detective.[190] A private Conan Doyle collection is a permanent exhibit at the Portsmouth City Museum, where the author lived and worked as a physician.[195]\\nThe Sherlock Holmes stories have been scrutinized by a few academics for themes of empire and colonialism.\\nSusan Cannon Harris claims that themes of contagion and containment are common in the Holmes series, including the metaphors of Eastern foreigners as the root cause of \"infection\" within and around Europe.[196] Lauren Raheja, writing in the Marxist journal Nature, Society, and Thought, claims that Doyle used these characteristics to paint eastern colonies in a negative light, through their continually being the source of threats. For example, in one story, Doyle makes mention of the Sumatran cannibals (also known as Batak) who throw poisonous darts, in \"The Adventure of the Devil\\'s Foot\", a character employs a deadly West African poison, and in \"The Speckled Band\", a \"long residence in the tropics\" was a negative influence on one antagonist\\'s bad temper.[197] Yumna Siddiqi argues that Doyle depicted returned colonials as \"marginal, physically ravaged characters that threaten the peace,\" while putting non-colonials in a much more positive light.[198]\\nThe popularity of Sherlock Holmes has meant that many writers other than Arthur Conan Doyle have created tales of the detective in a wide variety of different media, with varying degrees of fidelity to the original characters, stories, and setting. The first known period pastiche dates from 1891. Titled \"The Late Sherlock Holmes\", it was written by Conan Doyle\\'s close friend J. M. Barrie.[199]\\nAdaptations have seen the character taken in radically different directions or placed in different times or even universes. For example, Holmes falls in love and marries in Laurie R. King\\'s Mary Russell series, is re-animated after his death to fight future crime in the animated series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century, and is meshed with the setting of H. P. Lovecraft\\'s Cthulhu Mythos in Neil Gaiman\\'s \"A Study in Emerald\" (which won the 2004 Hugo Award for Best Short Story). An especially influential pastiche was Nicholas Meyer\\'s The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, a 1974 New York Times bestselling novel (made into the 1976 film of the same name) in which Holmes\\'s cocaine addiction has progressed to the point of endangering his career. It served to popularize the trend of incorporating clearly identified and contemporaneous historical figures (such as Oscar Wilde, Aleister Crowley, Sigmund Freud, or Jack the Ripper) into Holmesian pastiches, something Conan Doyle himself never did.[200][201][202] Another common pastiche approach is to create a new story fully detailing an otherwise-passing canonical reference (such as an aside by Conan Doyle mentioning the \"giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared\" in \"The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\").[203]\\nIn addition to the Holmes canon, Conan Doyle\\'s 1898 \"The Lost Special\" features an unnamed \"amateur reasoner\" intended to be identified as Holmes by his readers. The author\\'s explanation of a baffling disappearance argued in Holmesian style poked fun at his own creation. Similar Conan Doyle short stories are \"The Field Bazaar\", \"The Man with the Watches\", and 1924\\'s \"How Watson Learned the Trick\", a parody of the Watson–Holmes breakfast-table scenes. The author wrote other material featuring Holmes, especially plays: 1899\\'s Sherlock Holmes (with William Gillette), 1910\\'s The Speckled Band, and 1921\\'s The Crown Diamond (the basis for \"The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone\").[204] These non-canonical works have been collected in several works released since Conan Doyle\\'s death.[205]\\nIn terms of writers other than Conan Doyle, authors as diverse as Agatha Christie, Anthony Burgess, Neil Gaiman, Dorothy B. Hughes, Stephen King, Tanith Lee, A. A. Milne, and P. G. Wodehouse have all written Sherlock Holmes pastiches. Contemporary with Conan Doyle, Maurice Leblanc directly featured Holmes in his popular series about the gentleman thief, Arsène Lupin, though legal objections from Conan Doyle forced Leblanc to modify the name to \"Herlock Sholmes\" in reprints and later stories.[206] In 1944, American mystery writers Frederic Dannay and Manfred B. Lee (writing under their joint pseudonym Ellery Queen) published The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes, a collection of thirty-three pastiches written by various well-known authors.[207][208] Mystery writer John Dickson Carr collaborated with Arthur Conan Doyle\\'s son, Adrian Conan Doyle, on The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes, a pastiche collection from 1954.[209] In 2011, Anthony Horowitz published a Sherlock Holmes novel, The House of Silk, presented as a continuation of Conan Doyle\\'s work and with the approval of the Conan Doyle estate;[210] a follow-up, Moriarty, appeared in 2014.[211] The \"MX Book of New Sherlock Holmes Stories\" series of pastiches, edited by David Marcum and published by MX Publishing, has reached over thirty volumes and features hundreds of stories echoing the original canon which were compiled for the restoration of Undershaw and the support of Stepping Stones School, now housed in it.[212][213]\\nSome authors have written tales centred on characters from the canon other than Holmes. Anthologies edited by Michael Kurland and George Mann are entirely devoted to stories told from the perspective of characters other than Holmes and Watson. John Gardner, Michael Kurland, and Kim Newman, amongst many others, have all written tales in which Holmes\\'s nemesis Professor Moriarty is the main character. Mycroft Holmes has been the subject of several efforts: Enter the Lion by Michael P. Hodel and Sean M. Wright (1979),[214] a four-book series by Quinn Fawcett,[215] and 2015\\'s Mycroft Holmes, by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Anna Waterhouse.[216] M. J. Trow has written a series of seventeen books using Inspector Lestrade as the central character, beginning with The Adventures of Inspector Lestrade in 1985.[217] Carole Nelson Douglas\\' Irene Adler series is based on \"the woman\" from \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", with the first book (1990\\'s Good Night, Mr. Holmes) retelling that story from Adler\\'s point of view.[218] Martin Davies has written three novels where Baker Street housekeeper Mrs. Hudson is the protagonist.[219]\\nIn 1980\\'s The Name of the Rose, Italian author Umberto Eco creates a Sherlock Holmes of the 1320s in the form of a Franciscan friar and main protagonist named Brother William of Baskerville, his name a clear reference to Holmes per The Hound of the Baskervilles.[220] Brother William investigates a series of murders in the abbey alongside his novice Adso of Melk, who acts as his Dr. Watson. Furthermore, Umberto Eco\\'s description of Brother William bears marked similarities in both physique and personality to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\\'s description of Sherlock Holmes in A Study in Scarlet.[221]\\nLaurie R. King recreated Holmes in her Mary Russell series (beginning with 1994\\'s The Beekeeper\\'s Apprentice), set during the First World War and the 1920s. Her Holmes, semi-retired in Sussex, meets a teenaged American girl. Recognising a kindred spirit, he trains her as his apprentice and subsequently marries her. As of 2021, the series includes seventeen base novels and additional writings.[222]\\nShort stories featuring sage-detective Zavant Konniger and his halfling manservant Vido, written by fantasy authors Gordon Rennie and Josh Reynolds for the Warhammer Fantasy universe, were published by Black Library from 2002 to 2018, including \"How Vido Learned the Trick\" (\"How Watson Learned the Trick\") and \"The Problem of Three-Toll Bridge\" (\"The Problem of Thor Bridge\").[223][224]\\nThe Final Solution, a 2004 novella by Michael Chabon, concerns an unnamed but long-retired detective interested in beekeeping who tackles the case of a missing parrot belonging to a Jewish refugee boy.[225] Mitch Cullin\\'s novel A Slight Trick of the Mind (2005) takes place two years after the end of the Second World War and explores an old and frail Sherlock Holmes (now 93) as he comes to terms with a life spent in emotionless logic;[226] this was also adapted into a film, 2015\\'s Mr. Holmes.[227]\\nThere have been many scholarly works dealing with Sherlock Holmes, some working within the bounds of the Great Game, and some written from the perspective that Holmes is a fictional character. In particular, there have been three major annotated editions of the complete series. The first was William Baring-Gould\\'s 1967 The Annotated Sherlock Holmes. This two-volume set was ordered to fit Baring-Gould\\'s preferred chronology, and was written from a Great Game perspective. The second was 1993\\'s The Oxford Sherlock Holmes (general editor: Owen Dudley Edwards), a nine-volume set written in a straight scholarly manner. The most recent is Leslie Klinger\\'s The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes (2004–05), a three-volume set that returns to a Great Game perspective.[228][229]\\nIn 2012, Guinness World Records listed Holmes as the most portrayed literary human character in film and television history, with more than 75 actors playing the part in over 250 productions.[3]\\nThe 1899 play Sherlock Holmes, by Conan Doyle and William Gillette, was a synthesis of several Conan Doyle stories. In addition to its popularity, the play is significant because it, rather than the original stories, introduced one of the key visual qualities commonly associated with Holmes today: his calabash pipe;[230] the play also formed the basis for Gillette\\'s 1916 film, Sherlock Holmes. Gillette performed as Holmes some 1,300 times. In the early 1900s, H. A. Saintsbury took over the role from Gillette for a tour of the play. Between this play and Conan Doyle\\'s own stage adaptation of \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\", Saintsbury portrayed Holmes over 1,000 times.[231]\\nHolmes\\'s first screen appearance was in the 1900 Mutoscope film, Sherlock Holmes Baffled.[232] From 1921 to 1923, Eille Norwood played Holmes in forty-seven silent films (45 shorts and two features), in a series of performances that Conan Doyle spoke highly of.[2][233] 1929\\'s The Return of Sherlock Holmes was the first sound title to feature Holmes.[234] From 1939 to 1946, Basil Rathbone played Holmes and Nigel Bruce played Watson in fourteen U.S. films (two for 20th Century Fox and a dozen for Universal Pictures) and in The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes radio show. While the Fox films were period pieces, the Universal films abandoned Victorian Britain and moved to a then-contemporary setting in which Holmes occasionally battled Nazis.[235]\\nThe character has also enjoyed numerous radio adaptations, beginning with Edith Meiser\\'s The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,[236] which ran from 1930 to 1936. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce continued with their roles for most of the run of The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, airing from 1939 to 1950. Bert Coules, having dramatised the entire Holmes canon for BBC Radio Four from 1989 to 1998,[237][238] penned The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes between 2002 and 2010. This pastiche series also aired on Radio Four and starred Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams and then Andrew Sachs as Watson.[237][239]\\nThe 1984–85 Italian/Japanese anime series Sherlock Hound adapted the Holmes stories for children, with its characters being anthropomorphic dogs. The series was co-directed by Hayao Miyazaki.[240] Between 1979 and 1986, the Soviet studio Lenfilm produced a series of five television films, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. The series were split into eleven episodes and starred Vasily Livanov as Holmes and Vitaly Solomin as Watson. For his performance, in 2006 Livanov was appointed an Honorary Member of the Order of the British Empire.[241][242]\\nJeremy Brett played the detective in Sherlock Holmes for Granada Television from 1984 to 1994. Watson was played by David Burke (in the first two series) and Edward Hardwicke (in the remainder). Brett and Hardwicke also appeared on stage in 1988–89 in The Secret of Sherlock Holmes, directed by Patrick Garland.[243]\\nThe 2009 film Sherlock Holmes earned Robert Downey Jr. a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal of Holmes and co-starred Jude Law as Watson.[244] Downey and Law returned for a 2011 sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.\\nBenedict Cumberbatch plays a modern version of the detective and Martin Freeman as a modern version of John Watson in the BBC One TV series Sherlock, which premiered in 2010. In the series, created by Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat, the stories\\' original Victorian setting is replaced by present-day London, with Watson a veteran of the modern War in Afghanistan.[245] Similarly, Elementary premiered on CBS in 2012 and ran for seven seasons, until 2019. Set in contemporary New York, the series featured Jonny Lee Miller as Sherlock Holmes and Lucy Liu as a female Dr. Joan Watson.[246] With 24 episodes per season, by the end of season two, Miller became the actor who had portrayed Sherlock Holmes the most in television and/or film.[247]\\nThe 2015 film Mr. Holmes starred Ian McKellen as a retired Sherlock Holmes living in Sussex, in 1947, who grapples with an unsolved case involving a beautiful woman. The film is based on Mitch Cullin\\'s 2005 novel A Slight Trick of the Mind.[248][249]\\nThe 2018 television adaptation, Miss Sherlock, was a Japanese-language production and the first adaptation with a woman (portrayed by Yūko Takeuchi) in the signature role. The episodes were based in modern-day Tokyo, with many references to Conan Doyle\\'s stories.[250][251]\\nHolmes has also appeared in video games, including the Sherlock Holmes series of eight main titles. According to the publisher, Frogwares, by 2017 the series sold over seven million copies.[252]\\nThe copyright for Conan Doyle\\'s works expired in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia at the end of 1980, fifty years after Conan Doyle\\'s death.[253][254] In the United Kingdom it was revived in 1996 due to new provisions harmonising UK law with that of the European Union, and expired again at the end of 2000 (seventy years after Conan Doyle\\'s death).[255] The author\\'s works are now in the public domain in those countries.[256][257]\\nIn the United States, all works published before 1923 entered public domain by 1998, but, as ten Holmes stories were published after that date, the Conan Doyle estate maintained that the Holmes and Watson characters as a whole were still under copyright.[254][258] On 14 February 2013, Leslie S. Klinger (lawyer and editor of The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes) filed a declaratory judgement suit against the Conan Doyle estate asking the court to acknowledge that the characters of Holmes and Watson were public domain in the U.S. The court ruled in Klinger\\'s favour on 23 December, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed its decision on 16 June 2014. The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case, letting the appeals court\\'s ruling stand. This resulted in the characters from the Holmes stories being in the public domain in the U.S. The stories still under copyright due to the ruling, as of that time, were those collected in The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes other than \"The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone\" and \"The Problem of Thor Bridge\": a total of ten stories.[257][259][260]\\nIn 2020, although the United States court ruling and the passage of time meant that most of the Holmes stories and characters were in the public domain in that country, the Doyle estate legally challenged the use of Sherlock Holmes in the film Enola Holmes in a complaint filed in the United States.[261] The Doyle estate alleged that the film depicts Holmes with personality traits that were only exhibited by the character in the stories still under copyright.[262][263] On 18 December 2020, the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice by stipulation of all parties.[264][265]\\nThe remaining ten Holmes stories moved out of copyright between 1 January 2019 and 1 January 2023, leaving the stories and characters completely in the public domain in the United States as of the latter date.[266][267][268]\\nThe short stories, originally published in magazines, were later collected in five anthologies:\\n',\n",
       " 'Akimitsu Takagi (高木 彬光, Takagi Akimitsu, 25 September 1920 – 9 September 1995) was the pen-name of a popular Japanese crime fiction writer active during the Shōwa period of Japan. His real name was Takagi Seiichi.\\nTakagi was born in Aomori City in Aomori Prefecture in northern Japan. He graduated from the Daiichi High School (which was often abbreviated to Ichi-ko) and Kyoto Imperial University, where he studied metallurgy. He was employed by the Nakajima Aircraft Company, but lost his job with the prohibition on military industries in Japan after World War II.\\nOn the recommendation of a fortune-teller, he decided to become a writer. He sent the second draft of his first detective story, The Tattoo Murder Case, to the great mystery writer Edogawa Ranpo, who recognized his skill and who recommended it to a publisher. It was published in 1948.\\nHe received the Tantei sakka club sho (Mystery Writers Club Award) for his second novel, the Noh Mask Murder Case in 1950.\\nTakagi was a self-taught legal expert and the heroes in most of his books were usually prosecutors or police detectives, although the protagonist in his first stories was Kyosuke Kamizu, an assistant professor at Tokyo University.\\nTakagi explored variations on the detective novel in the 1960s, including historical mysteries, picaresque novels, legal mysteries, economic crime stories, and science fiction alternate history.\\nIn The Informer (1965), a former Tokyo stock exchange worker is fired because of illegal trades. A subsequent stock market crash means that he has no hope of returning to his old career and therefore he accepts a job from an old friend even though he eventually discovers that the new firm he works for is really an agency for industrial espionage. The plot is based on actual events.\\nBehind the writer, there is also the photographer passionate about traditional Japanese tattooing. Takagi came into contact with the Tokyo tattoo scene while writing his first novel (Shisei Satsujin Jiken, 1948) and began to document it. In the 1950s, he photographed the greatest tattoo artists of the time, their clients and their tattoos, thus creating an archive that is as unseen as it is rare. Discovered in 2017 by French journalist Pascal Bagot [archive], a specialist in tattooing in Japan, these images - of an unexpected quality for a non-professional - were collected in a book entitled The Tattoo Writer [archive] and published in 2022. They establish him as one of the most important witnesses to the history of tattooing in 20th century Japan.\\nHe was struck by stroke several times since 1979, and died in 1995.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nJosephine Tey was a pseudonym used by Elizabeth MacKintosh (25 July 1896 – 13 February 1952), a Scottish author. Her novel The Daughter of Time, a detective work investigating the role of Richard III of England in the death of the Princes in the Tower, was chosen by the British Crime Writers\\' Association in 1990 as the greatest crime novel of all time.[1] Her first play Richard of Bordeaux, written under another pseudonym, Gordon Daviot, starred John Gielgud in its successful West End run.\\nMacKintosh was born in Inverness, the oldest of three daughters of Colin MacKintosh, a fruiterer, and Josephine (née Horne). She attended Inverness Royal Academy and then, in 1914, Anstey Physical Training College in Erdington, a suburb of Birmingham.[2] She taught physical training at various schools in England and Scotland and during her vacations worked at a convalescent home in Inverness as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse. A youthful romance ended with her soldier friend\\'s death in the Somme battles.[3] In 1923, she returned to Inverness permanently to care for her invalid mother, and stayed after her mother\\'s death that year to keep house for her father.[4]\\nThe curriculum for \"physical training\" included much more than athletics. Tey used her school experience in Miss Pym Disposes when describing the subjects taught at the school, and the types of bruises and other injuries sustained by the pupils. When she graduated, Tey worked in a physiotherapy clinic in Leeds, then taught in schools, first in Nottinghamshire, then in Oban, where she was injured when a boom in the gymnasium fell on her face. Tey repurposed this incident as a method of murder in Miss Pym Disposes.\\nWhile caring for her father she began her career as a writer.[5] Her first published work was in The Westminster Gazette in 1925, under the name Gordon Daviot. She continued publishing verse and short stories in The Westminster Review, The Glasgow Herald and the Literary Review.\\nHer first novel, Kif: An Unvarnished History, was well received at the time with good reviews, a sale to America, and a mention in The Observer\\'s list of Books of the Week. This work, inspired by a detachment of the 4th Cameron Highlanders, a Scottish Territorial battalion stationed at Inverness before the First World War and prominent in the city\\'s affairs, was an early indication of Tey\\'s lasting interest in military matters.[6] Three months later, her first mystery novel, The Man in the Queue, was published by Benn, Methuen. It was awarded the Dutton Mystery Prize when published in America. This is the first appearance of her detective, Inspector Alan Grant. It would be some years before she wrote another mystery.\\nMacKintosh\\'s real ambition had been to write a play which would receive a run in London\\'s West End. Her play Richard of Bordeaux was produced in 1932 at the Arts Theatre, under the Daviot pseudonym. Its success was such that it transferred to the New Theatre (now the Noël Coward Theatre) in 1933, for a year-long run.[2] The production made a household name of its young leading man and director, John Gielgud (who became MacKintosh\\'s life-long friend).[7] (Tey writes of Inspector Alan Grant that \"he had in his youth seen Richard of Bordeaux; four times he had seen it\".)[8] She stated she was inspired by Gielgud\\'s performance in Hamlet and by the Royal Tournament.[9] Two more of her plays were produced at the New Theatre, The Laughing Woman (1934) and Queen of Scots (1934, written in collaboration with Gielgud).[7]\\nShe wrote about a dozen one-act plays and another dozen full-length plays, many with biblical or historical themes, under the name of Gordon Daviot but none of these received notable success.[2] How she chose the name of Gordon is unknown, but Daviot was the name of a scenic locale near Inverness where she had spent many happy holidays with her family.[5] Only four of her plays were produced during her lifetime.\\nHer only non-fiction book, Claverhouse, was written as a vindication of John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee, whom she regarded as a libeled hero: \"It is strange that a man whose life was so simple in pattern and so forthright in spirit should have become a peg for every legend, bloody or brave, that belonged to his time.\"\\nMacKintosh\\'s best-known books were written under the name of Josephine Tey, which was the name of her Suffolk great-great grandmother.\\nIn five of the mystery novels, all of which except the first she wrote under the name of Tey, the hero is Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant. (Grant appears in a sixth, The Franchise Affair, as a minor character.) The best known of these is The Daughter of Time, in which Grant, laid up in hospital, has friends research reference books and contemporary documents so that he can puzzle out the mystery of whether King Richard III of England murdered his nephews, the Princes in the Tower. \\nThe Franchise Affair also has an historical context: although set in the 1940s, it is based on the 18th-century case of Elizabeth Canning. The Daughter of Time was the last of Tey\\'s books published during her lifetime. Her last work, a further crime novel, The Singing Sands, was found in her papers and published posthumously.\\nTey was intensely private, shunning all publicity throughout her life.[10]  During her last year, when she knew that she was terminally ill, she resolutely avoided all her friends as well. Her penultimate work, The Privateer (1952), was a romantic novel based on the life of the privateer Henry Morgan. She died of liver cancer at her sister Mary\\'s home in London on 13 February 1952.[10]  Most of her friends, including Gielgud, were unaware that she was even ill.[11] Her obituary in The Times appeared under her real name: \"Miss E. Mackintosh Author of \\'Richard of Bordeaux\\'\".[2]\\nProceeds from Tey\\'s estate, including royalties from her books, were assigned to the National Trust.[10]\\nIn 1990, The Daughter of Time was selected by the British Crime Writers\\' Association as the greatest crime novel of all time; The Franchise Affair was 11th on the same list of 100 books.[1]\\nIn 2015, Val McDermid argued that Tey \"cracked open the door\" for later writers such as Patricia Highsmith and Ruth Rendell to explore the darker side of humanity, creating a bridge between the Golden Age of Detective Fiction and contemporary crime novels, because \"Tey opened up the possibility of unconventional secrets. Homosexual desire, cross-dressing, sexual perversion – they were all hinted at, glimpsed in the shadows as a door closed or a curtain twitched. Tey was never vulgar nor titillating.... Nevertheless, her world revealed a different set of psychological motivations.\"[12] In 2019, Evie Jeffrey discussed Tey\\'s engagement with capital punishment debates in A Shilling for Candles and To Love and Be Wise.[13]\\nAll as Josephine Tey except where specified\\n\\nAll as Josephine Tey.

       " 'Andrew Henry Vachss (/væks/ VAX;[1] October 19, 1942 – November 23, 2021) was an American crime fiction author, child protection consultant, and attorney exclusively representing children and youths.[2]\\nVachss grew up in Manhattan on the Lower West Side.[3] Before becoming a lawyer, Vachss held many front-line positions in child protection.[4] He was a federal investigator in sexually transmitted diseases, and a New York City social-services caseworker.  He worked in Biafra,[5] entering the war zone just before the fall of the country.[6] There he worked to find a land route to bring donated food and medical supplies across the border[7] after the seaports were blocked and Red Cross airlifts banned by the Nigerian government;[8] however, all attempts ultimately failed, resulting in rampant starvation.[9]\\nAfter he returned and recovered from his injuries, including malaria and malnutrition,[10] Vachss studied community organizing in 1970 under Saul Alinsky.[6] He worked as a labor organizer and ran a self-help center for urban migrants in Chicago.[11]  He then managed a re-entry program for ex-convicts in Massachusetts, and finally directed a maximum-security prison for violent juvenile offenders.[12]\\nAs an attorney, Vachss represented only children and adolescents.[13] In addition to his private practice, he served as a law guardian in New York state. In every child abuse or neglect case,[14] state law requires the appointment of a law guardian, a lawyer who represents the child\\'s interests during the legal proceedings.[15]\\nAndrew Vachss was the author of 33 novels and three collections of short stories, as well as poetry, plays, song lyrics, and graphic novels.[16]\\nAs a novelist, he was perhaps best known for his Burke series of hardboiled mysteries; Another Life[17] constituted the finale to the series.[18]\\nAfter completing the Burke novels, Vachss began two new series. Vachss released the first novel in the Dell & Dolly trilogy, entitled Aftershock, in 2013.[19] The second novel, Shockwave, was released in 2014,[20] and Signwave, the final book, was published in June 2015.[21] Departing from Vachss\\' familiar urban settings, the trilogy focuses on Dell, a former soldier and assassin, and Dolly, a former nurse with Doctors Without Borders and the love of Dell\\'s life. While living in the Pacific Northwest, Dell and Dolly use their war-honed skills to maintain a \"heads on stakes\" barrier against the predators who use their everyday positions in the community as camouflage in order to attack the vulnerable.[22]\\nThe Cross series uses distinctive supernatural aspects to further explore Vachss\\' argument that society\\'s failure to protect its children is the greatest threat to the human species. In 2012, Vachss\\' published Blackjack: A Cross Novel,[23] featuring the mercenary Cross Crew, introduced in earlier Vachss short stories as Chicago\\'s most-feared criminal gang. Urban Renewal, the second novel in the Cross series, came out in 2014.[24] The third in the series, Drawing Dead, was released in 2016.\\nIn addition to the Aftershock, Burke, and Cross series, Vachss wrote several stand-alone works. The first novel he published outside the Burke series was Shella. Released in 1993, Shella was the most polarizing of his works in terms of critical response.[25]  Vachss often referred to Shella as his \"beloved orphan\"[26]  until the 2004 release of The Getaway Man,[27] a tribute to the Gold Medal paperback originals of the 1960s. In 2005, Vachss released the epic Two Trains Running,[28] a novel which takes place entirely during a two-week span in 1959, a critical period in American history. In form, Two Trains Running presents as a work composed entirely of transcribed surveillance tapes,[29] akin to a collage film constructed only of footage from a single source. His 2009 novel, Haiku,[30] focuses on the troubled lives of a band of homeless men in New York City, struggling to connect with and protect each other. In 2010, Vachss published two books: his novel The Weight,[31] is a noir romance involving a professional thief and a young widow in hiding. Heart Transplant,[32] an illustrated novel in an experimental design, tells the story of an abused and bullied young boy who finds his inner strength with the help of an unexpected mentor. That\\'s How I Roll,[33] released in 2012, chronicles the death-row narrative of a hired killer as he reveals the secrets of his past, both horrifying and tender.\\nVachss collaborated on works with authors Jim Colbert (Cross, 1995)[34] and Joe R. Lansdale (Veil\\'s Visit, 1999).[35] He also created illustrated works with artists Frank Caruso (Heart Transplant, 2010)[36] and Geof Darrow (Another Chance to Get It Right, 1993;[37] The Shaolin Cowboy Adventure Magazine, 2014).[38] Vachss\\' graphic novel, Underground, was released in November 2014.[39]\\nVachss also wrote non-fiction, including numerous articles and essays on child protection[40] and a book on juvenile criminology.[41] His books have been translated into 20 languages, and his shorter works have appeared in many publications, including Parade, Antaeus, Esquire, Playboy, and The New York Times.[42] Vachss\\' literary awards include the Grand Prix de Littérature Policière for Strega [as La Sorcière de Brooklyn]; the Falcon Award, Maltese Falcon Society of Japan, for Strega; the Deutscher Krimi Preis for Flood [as Kata]; and the Raymond Chandler Award for his body of work.\\nAndrew Vachss was a member of PEN and the Writers Guild of America. His autobiographical essay was added by invitation to Contemporary Authors in 2003.\\nMany of Vachss\\' novels feature the shadowy, unlicensed investigator Burke, an ex-con, career criminal, and deeply conflicted character.  About his protagonist, Vachss said:\\nIf you look at Burke closely, you\\'ll see the prototypical abused child: hypervigilant, distrustful.  He\\'s so committed to his family of choice—not his DNA-biological family, which tortured him, or the state which raised him, but the family that he chose—that homicide is a natural consequence of injuring any of that family. He\\'s not a hit man. But he shares the same religion I do, which is revenge.Vachss coined the phrase \"Children of the Secret\", which refers to abused children, of whatever age, who were victimized without ever experiencing justice, much less love and protection.[44] In the Burke novels, some of these Children of the Secret have banded together as adults into what Vachss called a \"family of choice\".[45] Their connection is not biological, and they form very loyal bonds. Most are career criminals; none allows the law to come before the duty to family.\\nVachss originated the term \"Circle of Trust.\"[46] which has since entered general circulation. Vachss coined the term to combat the mistaken over-emphasis on \"stranger danger,\"[47] a bias that prevents society from focusing on the most common way children are accessed for victimization:\\nThe biggest threat to children is always inside their houses. The predator with the ski-mask who grabs the kid out of a van, while a real thing, is a tiny percentage of those who prey upon children. Most victimization of children is within the Circle of Trust—not necessarily a parent, but somebody who was let into that circle, who can be a counselor, or a coach, or someone at a day-care center. The biggest danger to children is that they\\'re perceived as property, not human beings. Another term Vachss originated is \"Transcenders.\"\\nI believe that many people who were abused as children do themselves—and the entire struggle—a disservice when they refer to themselves as \"survivors.\" A long time ago, I found myself in the middle of a war zone. I was not killed. Hence, I \"survived.\" That was happenstance ... just plain luck, not due to any greatness of character or heroism on my part. But what about those raised in a POW camp called \"childhood?\" Some of those children not only lived through it, not only refused to imitate the oppressor (evil is a decision, not a destiny), but actually maintained sufficient empathy to care about the protection of other children once they themselves became adults and were \"out of danger.\"\\nTo me, such people are our greatest heroes. They represent the hope of our species, living proof that there is nothing bio–genetic about child abuse. I call them transcenders, because \"surviving\" (i.e., not dying from) child abuse is not the significant thing. It is when chance becomes choice that people distinguish themselves. Two little children are abused. Neither dies. One grows up and becomes a child abuser. The other becomes a child protector. One \"passes it on.\" One \"breaks the cycle.\" Should we call them both by the same name? Not in my book. (And not in my books, either.)[49]Another important theme that pervades Vachss\\' work is his love of dogs, particularly breeds considered \"dangerous,\" such as Doberman pinschers, rottweilers, and especially pit bulls.[50] Throughout his writings,[51] Vachss asserted that with dogs, just as with humans, \"you get what you raise.\"[52]\\n\"There\\'s a very specific formula for creating a monster,\" Vachss says. \"It starts with chronic, unrelenting abuse. There\\'s got to be societal notification and then passing on. The child eventually believes that what\\'s being done is societally sanctioned. And after a while, empathy—which we have to learn, we\\'re not born with it—cracks and dies. He feels only his own pain. There\\'s your predatory sociopath.\"\\nThat\\'s why Vachss posed for a recent publicity photo cradling his pit bull puppy. \"You know what pit bulls are capable of, right?\" he asks, referring to the animal\\'s notorious killer reputation. \"But they\\'re also capable of being the most wonderful, sweet pets in the world, depending on how you raise them. That\\'s all our children.\"He was a passionate advocate against animal abuse such as dog-fighting,[54] and against breed-specific legislative bans.[55] With fellow crime writer James Colbert, Vachss trained dogs to serve as therapy dogs for abused children. The dogs have a calming effect on traumatized children. Vachss noted that using these particular breeds further increases the victims\\' feelings of security; their \"dangerous\" appearance, in combination with the extensive therapy training, makes them excellent protection against human threats.[56] During her time as chief prosecutor, Alice Vachss regularly brought one such trained dog, Sheba, to work with abused children being interviewed at the Special Victims Bureau.[57]\\nWhen Vachss was 7 years old, an older boy swung a chain at his right eye. The resulting injuries damaged the eye muscles and resulted in his wearing an eyepatch.[58] According to Vachss, removing it had the effect of a strobe light flashing in his face. Vachss also had a small blue heart tattooed on his right hand.[59]\\nVachss\\' wife, Alice, was a sex crimes prosecutor, and she later became Chief of the Special Victims Bureau in Queens, New York. She is the author of the nonfiction book Sex Crimes: Ten Years on the Front Lines Prosecuting Rapists and Confronting Their Collaborators, a New York Times Notable Book of the Year.[60] She has continued her work as Special Prosecutor for Sex Crimes in rural Oregon.[61]\\nHe died of coronary artery disease on November 23, 2021, at the age of 79 at his residence in Pacific Northwest.[62][63]\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nJohn Holbrook Vance (August 28, 1916 – May 26, 2013) was an American mystery, fantasy, and science fiction writer. Though most of his work has been published under the name Jack Vance, he also wrote several mystery novels under pen names, including Ellery Queen.\\nVance won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1984,[3] and he was a Guest of Honor at the 1992 World Science Fiction Convention in Orlando, Florida. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America made him its 15th Grand Master in 1997,[4] and the Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted him in 2001, its sixth class of two deceased and two living writers.[5][6]\\nHis most notable awards included Hugo Awards in 1963 for The Dragon Masters, in 1967 for The Last Castle, and in 2010 for his memoir This Is Me, Jack Vance!; the Nebula Award in 1966, also for The Last Castle; the Jupiter Award in 1975 and the World Fantasy Award in 1990 for Lyonesse: Madouc.[3] and the Edgar Award in 1961 for the best first mystery novel for The Man in the Cage.\\nHis first publications were stories in science fiction magazines. As he became well known, he published novellas and novels, many of which were translated into French, Dutch, Spanish, Russian, Italian and German. An Integral Edition of all Vance\\'s works was published in 44 volumes and in 2010 a six-volume The Complete Jack Vance was released. A 2009 profile in The New York Times Magazine described Vance as \"one of American literature\\'s most distinctive and undervalued voices\".[7] He died at his home in Oakland, California on May 26, 2013, aged 96.[8]\\nVance\\'s great-grandfather is believed to have arrived in California from Michigan a decade before the Gold Rush and married a San Francisco woman.[9] Early family records were apparently destroyed in the fire following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[10] Vance\\'s maternal grandfather, L. M. (Ludwig Mathias) Hoefler, was a successful lawyer in San Francisco.[9]\\nVance grew up in the family\\'s large house in San Francisco on Filbert Street. When Vance\\'s father left the family to live on his ranch in Mexico, the family\\'s house in San Francisco was rented out to the father\\'s sister.[9] With the separation of his parents, and the loss of use of the San Francisco house, Vance\\'s mother moved him and his siblings to their maternal grandfather\\'s California ranch near Oakley in the delta of the Sacramento River. This setting formed Vance\\'s love of the outdoors, and allowed him time to indulge his passion as an avid reader of his mother\\'s large book collection, which included Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Tarzan of the Apes and his Barsoom novels and Jules Verne\\'s The Mysterious Island.[9] When Vance explored the nearby town, he started reading pulp fiction magazines at the local drugstore.[9]\\nWith the death of his grandfather, who supported the family, which coincided with the economic challenges of Great Depression, the Vance family’s fortune dwindled, and Vance was forced to leave junior college and work to support himself, assisting his mother when able. Vance plied many trades for short stretches: as a bellhop (a \"miserable year\"), in a cannery, and on a gold dredge.[11] Vance described this era as a time of personal change: “Over a span of four or five years, I developed from an impractical little intellectual into a rather reckless young man, competent at many skills and crafts, and determined to try every phase of life.”[9]\\nHe subsequently entered the University of California, Berkeley, and over the next six years studied mining engineering, physics, journalism, and English. Vance wrote one of his first science fiction stories for an English class assignment: his professor commented in a scornful tone, \"We also have a piece of science fiction\"—Vance\\'s first negative review.[12]\\nHe worked as an electrician in the naval shipyards at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, being paid \"56¢ an hour,\" and worked for a time as part of a degaussing crew. The attack on Pearl Harbor took place about a month after he resigned his employment there.[11]\\nVance graduated in 1942.[13] Weak eyesight prevented military service. He found a job as a rigger at the Kaiser Shipyard in Richmond, California, and enrolled in an Army Intelligence program to learn Japanese, but washed out. In 1943, he memorized an eye chart and became an able seaman in the Merchant Marine.[12] In later years, boating remained his favorite recreation; boats and voyages are a frequent motif in his work. He worked as a seaman, a rigger, a surveyor, a ceramicist, and a carpenter before he established himself fully as a writer, which did not occur until the 1970s.\\nFrom his youth, Vance had been fascinated by Dixieland and traditional jazz. He was an amateur of the cornet and ukulele, often accompanying himself with a kazoo, and was a competent harmonica player. His first published writings were jazz reviews for The Daily Californian (his college paper), and music is an element in many of his works.\\nIn 1946, Vance met and married Norma Genevieve Ingold (died March 25, 2008), another Cal student. Vance continued to live in Oakland, in a house he built and extended with his family over the years, including a hand-carved wooden ceiling from Kashmir. The Vances had extensive travels,[14] including one around-the-world voyage, and often spent several months at a time living in places like Ireland, Tahiti, South Africa, Positano (in Italy) and on a houseboat on Lake Nagin in Kashmir.\\nVance began trying to become a professional writer in the late 1940s, as part of the San Francisco Renaissance, a movement of experimentation in literature and the arts. His first lucrative sale[when?] was one of the early Magnus Ridolph stories to Twentieth Century Fox, who also hired him as a screenwriter for the Captain Video television series. The proceeds supported the Vances for a year\\'s travel in Europe.[11] There are various references to the Bay Area Bohemian life in his work. In the 1950s, Vance started a pottery and ceramics hobby, buying a kiln; this interest was an influence on his story \"The Potters of Firsk” (1950).\\nScience fiction authors Frank Herbert and Poul Anderson were among Vance\\'s closest friends. In the early 1950s, when Frank Herbert was a reporter, he interviewed Vance, and the men became friends. They moved to Mexico with their families to establish a \"writer’s colony\" at Lake Chapala, near Guadalajara.[9] In 1962, Vance, Herbert, and Anderson jointly built a houseboat which they sailed in the Sacramento Delta. The Vances and the Herberts lived together near Lake Chapala, Mexico, for a while.[10][15] Vance\\'s interest in houseboats led him to depict them in “The Moon Moth” (1961), The Palace of Love (1967), and in chapter\\xa02 of Wyst: Alastor 1716 (1978).[9]\\nIn the early 1980s, Vance became increasingly interested in sailing, and he started building a 36-foot trimaran. Later, he owned  Venture (a 17-foot cutter-rigged boat), Columbia (a 35-foot ketch-rigged boat), and finally Hinano (a 45-foot boat).[9] While Vance derived pleasure from his sailing hobby, his increasingly poor eyesight and the high costs of outfitting, berthing, and maintaining the vessel led him to sell the Hinano.[9] Vance\\'s failing eyesight also led him to cease his amateur jazz hobby.[9]\\nAlthough legally blind since the 1980s,[13] Vance continued to write with the aid of BigEd software, written especially for him by Kim Kokkonen. His final novel was Lurulu. Although Vance had stated Lurulu would be his final book,[16] he subsequently completed an autobiography, which was published in July 2009.[17]\\nVance died on the morning of May 26, 2013, at the age of 96 in his home in the Oakland Hills.[18][19] Vance\\'s son John Holbrook Vance II described the cause as the complications of old age, saying \"everything just finally caught up with him\".[20] Tributes to Vance were given by various authors, including George R. R. Martin, Michael Moorcock, Neil Gaiman, and Elizabeth Bear.[21] Steven Gould, president of the Science Fiction Writers of America, described Vance as \"one of the greatest science fiction and fantasy writers of the 20th century\".[21] A memorial site set up by his family to post tributes received hundreds of messages in the days following his death.[21][22]\\nVance made his debut in print with \"The World-Thinker\", a 16-page story published by Sam Merwin in Thrilling Wonder Stories, Summer 1945.[1] His lifetime output totals more than 60 books—perhaps almost 90.[6] His work has been published in three categories: science fiction, fantasy and mystery. Among Vance\\'s earliest published work was a set of fantasy stories written while he served in the merchant marine during the war. They appeared in 1950, several years after Vance had started publishing science fiction in the pulp magazines, under the title The Dying Earth.[23]\\nVance wrote many science fiction short stories in the late 1940s and through the 1950s, which were published in magazines. Of his novels written during this period, a few were science fiction, but most were mysteries. Few were published at the time, but Vance continued to write mysteries into the early 1970s. In total, he wrote 15 novels outside of science fiction and fantasy, including the extended outline, The Telephone was Ringing in the Dark, published only by the VIE (Vance Integral Edition), and three books published under the Ellery Queen pseudonym.[24]  Some of these are not mysteries, such as Bird Isle, and many fit uneasily in the category. These stories are set in and around his native San Francisco, except for one set in Italy and another in Africa. Two begin in San Francisco but take to the sea.\\nMany themes important to his more famous science fiction novels appeared first in the mysteries. The most obvious is the \"book of dreams\", which appears in Bad Ronald and The View from Chickweed\\'s Window, prior to being featured in The Book of Dreams. The revenge theme is also more prominent in certain mysteries than in the science fiction (The View from Chickweed\\'s Window in particular). Bad Ronald was adapted to a TV film of the same name aired on ABC in 1974, as well as a French production (Méchant garçon) in 1992; this and Man in the Cage are the only works by Vance to be made into film to date.\\nCertain of the science fiction stories are also mysteries, penned using his full name John Holbrook Vance, three under the house pseudonym Ellery Queen, and one each using the pseudonyms Alan Wade, Peter Held, John van See, and Jay Kavanse.[1][25] Some editions of his published works give his year of birth as 1920. In addition to the comic Magnus Ridolph stories, two major stories feature the effectuator Miro Hetzel, a futuristic detective, and Araminta Station is largely concerned with solving various murders. Vance returned to the \"dying Earth\" setting (a far distant future in which the sun is slowly going out, and magic and technology coexist) to write the picaresque adventures of the ne\\'er-do-well scoundrel Cugel the Clever, and those of the magician Rhialto the Marvellous. These books were written in 1963, 1978 and 1981. His other major fantasy work, Lyonesse (a trilogy comprising Suldrun\\'s Garden, The Green Pearl, and Madouc), was completed in 1989 and set on a mythological archipelago off the coast of France in the early Middle Ages.\\nVance\\'s stories written for pulps in the 1940s and 1950s covered many science fiction themes, with a tendency to emphasize mysterious and biological themes (ESP, genetics, brain parasites, body switching, other dimensions, cultures) rather than technical ones. Robots, for example, are almost entirely absent, though the short story \"The Uninhibited Robot\" features a computer gone awry. Many of the early stories are comic. By the 1960s, Vance had developed a futuristic setting that he came to call the Gaean Reach, a fictional region of space settled by humans. Thereafter, all his science fiction was, more or less explicitly, set therein.[1] The Gaean Reach per se is loose and expanding, old Earth (Gaia), being the center. Each planet has its own history, state of development and culture. Within the Reach conditions tend to be peaceable and commerce tends to dominate. At the edges of the Reach, out in the lawless Beyond, conditions are usually less secure.\\nVance influenced many writers in the genre. Most notably, Michael Shea wrote a sequel to Eyes of the Overworld, featuring Cugel the Clever, before Vance did one himself (called Cugel\\'s Saga). Vance gave permission, and the book by Shea went into print before Vance\\'s. Shea\\'s book, A Quest For Simbilis, is entirely in keeping with the vision of Vance. Cugel is a complete rogue, who is nevertheless worthy of sympathy in always failing to achieve his goals.[26]\\nWhen asked about literary influences, Vance most often cited Jeffery Farnol, a writer of adventure books, whose style of \"high\" language he mentions (the Farnol title Guyfford of Weare being a typical instance); P. G. Wodehouse, an influence apparent in Vance\\'s taste for overbearing aunts; and L. Frank Baum, whose fantasy elements were directly borrowed by Vance (see The Emerald City of Oz).[27] In the introduction to Dowling and Strahan\\'s The Jack Vance Treasury, Vance mentions that his childhood reading including Edgar Rice Burroughs, Jules Verne, Robert W. Chambers, science fiction published by Edward Stratemeyer, the magazines Weird Tales and Amazing Stories, and Lord Dunsany.[11] According to pulp editor Sam Merwin, Vance\\'s earliest magazine submissions in the 1940s were heavily influenced by the style of James Branch Cabell.[28] Fantasy historian Lin Carter notes several probable lasting influences of Cabell on Vance\\'s work, and suggests that the early \"pseudo-Cabell\" experiments bore fruit in The Dying Earth (1950).[29]  SF critic Don Herron[30] cites Clark Ashton Smith as an influence on Vance\\'s style and characters\\' names.\\nVance\\'s science fiction runs the gamut from stories written for pulps in the 1940s to multi-volume tales set in the space age. Scott Bradfield states that Vance \"wrote about incomprehensibly far-off futures that weren’t driven by the splashy intergalactic military conflicts of his Golden Age predecessors, such as E.E. Doc Smith or Robert A. Heinlein. Instead, Vance’s futures are marked by rich, panoramic socioeconomic systems.\"[31] While Vance\\'s stories have a wide variety of temporal settings, a majority of them belong to a period long after humanity has colonized other stars, culminating in the development of a fictional region of interstellar space called the Gaean Reach. In its early phase, exhibited by the Oikumene of the Demon Princes series, this expanding, loose and pacific agglomerate has an aura of colonial adventure, commerce and exoticism. Later it becomes peace-loving and stolidly middle class.\\nVance\\'s stories are seldom concerned directly with war and the conflicts are rarely direct. If there are battles, such as in the slave revolt against the nobility at the end of The Last Castle, they are depicted in an abbreviated length, as Vance is more interested in the social and political context than the clashing of swords. Sometimes at the edges of the Reach or in the lawless areas of Beyond, a planet is menaced or craftily exploited. Some more extensive battles are described in The Dragon Masters, The Miracle Workers, and the Lyonesse Trilogy, in which medieval-style combat abounds. His characters usually become inadvertently enmeshed in low-intensity conflicts between alien cultures; this is the case in Emphyrio, the Tschai series, the Durdane series, or the comic stories in Galactic Effectuator, featuring Miro Hetzel. Personal, cultural, social, or political conflicts are the central concerns. This is most particularly the case in the Cadwal series, though it is equally characteristic of the three Alastor books, Maske: Thaery, and, one way or another, in most of his science fiction novels.\\nAnother way in which Vance expands the usually narrow focus of most speculative fiction writers are the extensive details ranging from the culture of language, to food, music, and rituals. In The Languages of Pao, after a planet with a passive, lazy and backwards culture is invaded and occupied, the planet\\'s leader orders three new languages developed, to make his people more aggressive, industrious and inventive. In the short story \"The Moon Moth\", natives must master a number of musical instruments in order to communicate with each other. Spoken words are modulated to acquire different meanings, or may be said to be given full meaning, (respect, derision or sarcasm) by means of the musical sounds. These fascinating details paint a far more detailed and complex picture of life and cultures in his books.\\nThe \"Joe Bain\" stories (The Fox Valley Murders, The Pleasant Grove Murders, and an unfinished outline published by the VIE) are set in an imaginary northern California county; these are the nearest to the classical mystery form, with a rural policeman as protagonist. Bird Isle, by contrast, is not a mystery at all, but a Wodehousian idyll (also set near San Francisco), while The Flesh Mask or Strange People\\xa0... emphasize psychological drama. The theme of both The House on Lily Street and Bad Ronald is solipsistic megalomania, taken up again in the Demon Princes cycle of science fiction novels.\\nThree books published under the house name Ellery Queen were written to editorial requirements and heavily revised by the publisher. (Volume 45 of The Vance Integral Edition contains the original text for the three Ellery Queen novels. Vance previously refused to acknowledge them for their degree of rewriting.) Four others reflect Vance\\'s world travels: Strange People, Queer Notions based on his stay in Positano, Italy; The Man in the Cage, based on a trip to Morocco; The Dark Ocean, set on a merchant marine vessel; and The Deadly Isles, based on a stay in Tahiti.\\nThe mystery novels reveal much about Vance\\'s evolution as a science fiction and fantasy writer. He stopped working in the mystery genre in the early 1970s, except for science-fiction mysteries; see below. Bad Ronald is especially noteworthy for its portrayal of a trial-run for Howard Alan Treesong of The Book of Dreams. The Edgar-Award-winning The Man in the Cage is a thriller set in North Africa at around the period of the French-Algerian war. A Room to Die In is a classic \\'locked-room\\' murder mystery featuring a strong-willed young woman as the amateur detective. Bird Isle, a mystery set at a hotel on an island off the California coast, reflects Vance\\'s taste for farce.\\nVance\\'s two rural Northern California mysteries featuring Sheriff Joe Bain were well received by the critics. The New York Times said of The Fox Valley Murders: \"Mr. Vance has created the county with the same detailed and loving care with which, in the science fiction he writes as Jack Vance, he can create a believable alien planet.\" And Dorothy B. Hughes, in The Los Angeles Times, wrote that it was \"fat with character and scene\". As for the second Bain novel, The New York Times said: \"I like regionalism in American detective stories, and I enjoy reading about the problems of a rural county sheriff ... and I bless John Holbrook Vance for the best job of satisfying these tastes with his wonderful tales of Sheriff Joe Bain\\xa0...\".\\nVance has also written mysteries set in his science fiction universes. An early 1950s short story series features Magnus Ridolph, an interstellar adventurer and amateur detective who is elderly and not prone to knocking anyone down, and whose exploits appear to have been inspired, in part, by those of Jack London\\'s South Seas adventurer, Captain David Grief. The \"Galactic Effectuator\" novelettes feature Miro Hetzel, a figure who resembles Ridolph in his blending of detecting and troubleshooting (the \"effectuating\" indicated by the title). A number of the other science fiction novels include mystery, spy thriller, or crime-novel elements: The Houses of Iszm, Son of the Tree, the Alastor books Trullion and Marune, the Cadwal series, and large parts of the Demon Princes series.\\nAccording to writer Michael Chabon, \"Jack Vance is the most painful case of all the writers I love who I feel don’t get the credit they deserve. If ‘The Last Castle’ or ‘The Dragon Masters’ had the name Italo Calvino on it, or just a foreign name, it would be received as a profound meditation, but because he\\'s Jack Vance and published in Amazing Whatever, there\\'s this insurmountable barrier.\"[32]\\nVance fans developed a website called Totality (pharesm.org), which enables users to do electronic searches of the Vance Integral Edition texts.[32]\\nFor most of his career, Vance\\'s work suffered the vicissitudes common to most writers in his chosen field: ephemeral publication of stories in magazine form, short-lived softcover editions, in which stories sometimes were insensitively edited beyond his control. As he became more widely recognized, conditions improved, and his works became internationally renowned among aficionados. Much of his work has been translated into several languages, including Dutch, Esperanto, French, Spanish, Russian, and Italian.[note 1] Beginning in the 1960s, Jack Vance\\'s work has also been extensively translated into German. In the large German-language market, his books continue to be widely read.\\nVance was an original member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers\\' Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of heroic fantasy authors founded in the 1960s and led by Lin Carter. Its purpose was to promote the sword and sorcery subgenre (such as Dying Earth stories by Vance), and some new works were published in Flashing Swords! anthologies edited by Carter, in both mass-market paperback and Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club editions.[1]\\nIn 1976, the fantasy/sf small press Underwood-Miller released their first publication, the first hardcover edition of The Dying Earth in a high-quality limited edition of just over 1000 copies. Other titles in the \"Dying Earth\" cycle also received hardcover treatment from Underwood-Miller shortly thereafter, such as The Eyes of the Overworld and Cugel\\'s Saga. After these first publications and until the mid-1990s, Underwood-Miller published many of Vance\\'s works, including his mystery fiction, often in limited editions featuring dustjacket artwork by leading fantasy artists. The entire Jack Vance output from Underwood-Miller comes close to a complete collection of Vance\\'s previously published works, many of which had not seen hardcover publication. Also, many of these editions are described as \"the author\\'s preferred text\", meaning that they have not been drastically edited. In the mid-1990s, Tim Underwood and Charles Miller parted company. However, they have continued to publish Vance titles individually, including such works as Emphyrio and To Live Forever by Miller, and a reprint edition of The Eyes of the Overworld by Underwood. Because of the low print-run on many of these titles, often they could only be found in science fiction bookstores at the time of their release.\\nAn Integral Edition of all Vance\\'s works was published in a limited edition of 44 hardback volumes. A special 45th volume contains the three novels Vance wrote as Ellery Queen. This edition was created from 1999 to 2006 by 300 volunteers working via the internet, under the aegis of the author.[33] The texts and titles used are those preferred by the author.[citation needed]\\nIn 2010, Afton House Books presented The Complete Jack Vance ISBN\\xa0978-0-9825953-0-5 in six large volumes using texts prepared by the Vance Integral Edition. Volume six has a table of contents for the volumes; otherwise there is no exegesis. Issues of the project\\'s magazine Cosmopolis describe the production process (of interest to anyone wishing accurate transcription of scanned text) and the detection of some surprising errors such as the scanning of \"and\" being recognised as \"arid\" (Cosmopolis 17, page 8) yet resulting in a sentence that is both grammatically acceptable and as well, plausibly in context: \"It was hot, arid dusty.\". Similarly, there is no bibliography of where the stories have previously been published. Cover art may be found via Category:Jack Vance book cover images or [1] and many others.\\nIn 2012, Spatterlight Press started offering DRM-free e-books editions of many of the works of Jack Vance, based on the source texts collected by the Integral Edition project. It is the intent of Spatterlight Press to publish the complete Integral Edition in e-book form, and also as print-on-demand paperbacks.[34]   Gollancz use the VIE texts in their \"SF Gateway\" e-ditions starting in 2012.\\n',\n",

Van de Wetering lived a year in Daitoku-ji and half a year with Nowick outside the temple, and described his experiences in his book The Empty Mirror. The book includes an account of a visit to the monastery by Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle, describing his own mixed thoughts about this representative of what he deemed an old-fashioned religion.

He died in Blue Hill, Maine.\\nJanwillem van de Wetering was particularly noted for his detective fiction, his most popular creations being Grijpstra and de Gier, a pair of Amsterdam police officers who figure in a lengthy series of novels and short stories. Most of the mysteries are rich with images from Amsterdam, where most of them take place; some also feature a cat: in earlier novels, one named Oliver; in later novels, a female named Tabriz. He also wrote stories for children and nonfiction works. He usually wrote in Dutch and then in English; the two versions often differ considerably.\\nAdjutant-Detective Henk Grijpstra and Detective-Sergeant Rinus de Gier, along with their never-named elderly superior, the Commissaris, are the most popular creations of Janwillem van de Wetering.  They are police detectives in the Murder Brigade of the Amsterdam Municipal Police, and are featured in fourteen detective novels and several short stories published in Ellery Queen\\'s Mystery Magazine and Alfred Hitchcock\\'s Mystery Magazine.\\nGrijpstra, heavy, middle-aged, and less than happily married, is the senior partner of the duo.

       " 'Robert Hans van Gulik (Chinese: 髙羅佩; pinyin: Gāo Luópèi, 9 August 1910 – 24 September 1967) was a Dutch orientalist, diplomat, musician (of the guqin), and writer, best known for the Judge Dee historical mysteries, the protagonist of which he borrowed from the 18th-century Chinese detective novel Dee Goong An.\\nRobert van Gulik was born in Zutphen, the son of a medical officer in the Dutch army of what was then called the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia). He was born in the Netherlands, but from the age of three till twelve he lived in Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta), where he was tutored in Mandarin and other languages. He went to Leiden University in 1929. He began his studies under the Sinologist J.J.L. Duyvendak, whose interests were in Ancient China. Perhaps because of his upbringing in the East Indies, Van Gulik\\'s interests were in later periods, and he transferred and obtained his PhD in 1935 from Utrecht University. His talents as a linguist suited him for a job in the Dutch Foreign Service, which he joined in 1935; and he was then stationed in various countries, mostly in East Asia (Japan and China).[1]\\nHe was in Tokyo when Japan declared war on the Netherlands in 1941, but he, along with the rest of the Allied diplomatic staff, was evacuated in 1942. He spent most of the rest of World War II as the secretary for the Dutch mission to Chiang Kai-shek\\'s Nationalist government in Chongqing. While in Chongqing, he married a Chinese woman, Shui Shifang (Chinese: 水世芳) (1912-2005), the daughter of a Qing dynasty Imperial mandarin, and they had four children together. There he freely mingled with prominent figures in traditional and modern Chinese culture, though he had little interest in China\\'s modernization and the intellectual changes since the New Culture Movement. [2]\\nVan Gulik was an accomplished calligrapher. His work is known in China under the name Kao Lo-p\\'ei[3](Chinese: 髙羅佩; pinyin: Gāo Luópèi).\\nAfter the war ended, he returned to the Netherlands, then went to the United States as the counsellor of the Dutch Embassy in Washington, D.C. He returned to Japan in 1949 and stayed there for the next four years. While in Tokyo, he published his first two books, the translation Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee and a privately published book of erotic colored prints from the Ming dynasty. Later postings took him all over the world, from New Delhi, Kuala Lumpur, and Beirut (during the 1958 Civil War) to The Hague. In 1959 Van Gulik became correspondent of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences; he resigned in 1963. In 1964 he became a full member, and the next year he became a foreign member.[4] From 1965 until his death from cancer at The Hague in 1967, he was the Dutch ambassador to Japan.\\nDuring World War II van Gulik translated the 18th-century detective novel Dee Goong An into English under the title Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee (first published in Tokyo in 1949). The main character of this book, Judge Dee, was based on the real statesman and detective Di Renjie, who lived in the 7th century, during the Tang dynasty (AD 618–907), though in the novel itself elements of Ming dynasty China (AD 1368–1644) were mixed in.[5]\\nThanks to his translation of this largely forgotten work, van Gulik became interested in Chinese detective fiction. To the translation he appended an essay on the genre in which he suggested that it was easy to imagine rewriting some of the old Chinese case histories with an eye toward modern readers. Not long afterward he himself tried his hand at creating a detective story along these lines. This became the book The Chinese Maze Murders (completed around 1950). As van Gulik thought the story would have more interest to Japanese and Chinese readers, he had it translated into Japanese by a friend (finished in 1951), and it was sold in Japan under the title Meiro-no-satsujin. With the success of the book, van Gulik produced a translation into Chinese, which was published by a Singapore book publisher in 1953. The reviews were good, and van Gulik wrote two more books (The Chinese Bell Murders and The Chinese Lake Murders) over the next few years, also with an eye toward Japanese and then Chinese editions. Next, van Gulik found a publisher for English versions of the stories, and the first such version was published in 1957. Later books were written and published in English first; the translations came afterwards.[5]\\nVan Gulik\\'s intent in writing his first Judge Dee novel was, as he wrote in remarks on The Chinese Bell Murders, \"to show modern Chinese and Japanese writers that their own ancient crime-literature has plenty of source material for detective and mystery-stories\".[6] In 1956, he published a translation of the T\\'ang-yin-pi-shih (\"Parallel Cases from Under the Pear Tree\"), a 13th-century casebook for district magistrates. He used many of the cases as plots in his novels (as he states in the postscripts of the novels).\\nVan Gulik\\'s Judge Dee mysteries follow in the long tradition of Chinese detective fiction, intentionally preserving a number of key elements of that writing culture. Most notably, he had Judge Dee solve three different (and sometimes unrelated) cases in each book, a traditional device in Chinese mysteries. The whodunit element is also less important in the Judge Dee stories than it is in the traditional Western detective story, though still more so than in traditional Chinese detective stories. Nevertheless, van Gulik\\'s fiction was adapted to a more Western audience, avoiding the supernatural and religious traditions of Buddhism and Daoism in favour of rationality.[7]\\nFriends and even his daughter, Pauline, said that he identified with Judge Dee. He lived the life of a mandarin who cultivated calligraphy, poems and paintings. When he started writing the stories in 1949, he was in a conservative and nostalgic mood, remarking \"Judge Dee, it\\'s me\".[8]\\nRobert van Gulik studied Indisch Recht (Dutch Indies law) and Indologie (Indonesian culture) at Leiden University from 1929 until 1934, receiving his doctorate for a dissertation on the horse cult in Northeast Asia at Utrecht University. Though he made his career in the Dutch diplomatic service, he kept up his studies. During his life he wrote twenty-odd essays and monographs on various subjects, mainly but not exclusively on aspects of Chinese culture. Typically, much of his scholarly work was first published outside the Netherlands. In his lifetime van Gulik was recognized as a European expert on Imperial Chinese jurisprudence.\\nVan Gulik was interested in Chinese painting. For example, in his book The Gibbon in China (1967), he devotes pages to the gibbon-themed paintings in China and Japan, from the Northern Song dynasty onwards. Analyzing the portrayal of these apes throughout history, he notes how the realism of the pictures deteriorated as the gibbon population in most of China was extirpated. As an art critic, he greatly admired the portrayal of the apes by such renowned painters as Yi Yuanji and Muqi Fachang. Commenting on one of Ming Emperor Xuande\\'s works, \"Gibbons at Play\", van Gulik says that while it is \"not a great work of art\", it is \"ably executed\". The lifelike images of the apes make one surmise that the emperor painted from the live models that could have been kept in the palace gardens.[9][10]\\nIn 1977 part of the library of Robert van Gulik was acquired from the heirs of Van Gulik for the Sinological Institute at Leiden University and transferred in 2016 to Leiden University Libraries.[11]\\nIn 2022 and 2023 the personal archive and collection of Robert van Gulik was donated by his heirs to Leiden University Libraries.[12]\\n',\n",

This theme was developed further in a third series of novels, published under the pseudonym Barbara Vine.\\nRendell was born as Ruth Barbara Grasemann in 1930, in South Woodford, Essex (now Greater London).[3] Her parents were teachers. Her mother, Ebba Kruse, was born in Sweden to Danish parents and brought up in Denmark; her father, Arthur Grasemann, was English. As a result of spending Christmas and other holidays in Scandinavia, Rendell learned Swedish and Danish.[4]  Rendell was educated at the County High School for Girls in Loughton, Essex,[3] the town to which the family moved during her childhood.\\nAfter high school, she became a feature writer for her local Essex paper, the Chigwell Times.  However, she was forced to resign after filing a story about a local sports club dinner she hadn\\'t attended and failing to report that the after-dinner speaker had died midway through the speech.[5]\\nRendell met her husband Don Rendell when she was working as a newswriter.[3] They married when she was 20, and in 1953 had a son, Simon,[6] now a psychiatric social worker who lives in the U.S. state of Colorado. The couple divorced in 1975 but remarried two years later.[7]  Don Rendell died in 1999 from prostate cancer.[6]\\nShe made the county of Suffolk her home for many years, using the settings in several of her novels. She lived in the villages of Polstead and later Groton, both east of Sudbury. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1996 Birthday Honours[8] and a life peer as Baroness Rendell of Babergh, of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk, on 24 October 1997.[9] She sat in the House of Lords for the Labour Party. In 1998 Rendell was named on a list of the party\\'s biggest private financial donors.[10] She introduced into the Lords the bill that would later become the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 (the intent was to prevent the practice).\\nIn August 2014, Rendell was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September\\'s referendum on that issue.[11]\\nRendell was a vegetarian who was described as living mostly on fruit.[12] She described herself as \"slightly agoraphobic\" and slept in a specially made four-poster bed because \"I like to feel enclosed.\"[12]\\nBaroness Rendell\\'s awards include the Silver, Gold, and Cartier Diamond Daggers from the Crime Writers\\' Association, three Edgars from the Mystery Writers of America, The Arts Council National Book Awards, and The Sunday Times Literary Award.[2] A number of her works (see the section below) have been adapted for film or television.[13][14] She was also a patron of the charity Kids for Kids[15] which helps children in rural areas of Darfur. There is a blue plaque on one of her homes, 45 Millsmead Way, in Loughton. This was unveiled by her son Simon on 24 February 2016.[16]  Four of her novels appear on the British-based Crime Writers Association Poll (1990) of the best crime fiction novels ever written: two under the Rendell name and two under her pen name of Barbara Vine.[citation needed]\\nHer Crime Writer’s Association Dagger wins (four Gold, one Silver and one Cartier Diamond) remains unmatched, as does her record of being the first author to be nominated and win under multiple names.  Her unparalleled Edgar and Dagger finalist nominations include: A Judgement In Stone (1977 Gold Dagger finalist), A Sleeping Life (1979 Edgar finalist for Best Novel), Make Death Love Me (1980 Edgar finalist for Best Novel), The Speaker Of Mandarin (1983 Gold Dagger finalist), An Unkindness Of Ravens and The Tree Of Hands (both 1986 Edgar finalists for Best Novel), A Dark-Adapted Eye (as Barbara Vine, 1986 Gold Dagger finalist), A Fatal Inversion (as Barbara Vine 1988 Macavity Award finalist for Best Novel), and Going Wrong (1990 Gold Dagger finalist.)  [17] Additionally, she was nominated four times in the Edgar “Best Short Story” category (in 1976 for The Fall Of The Coin and 1977 for People Don’t Do Such Things) winning twice for The Fallen Curtain (1975) and The New Girlfriend (1984).[18]\\nRendell had a stroke on 7 January 2015[19] and died on 2 May 2015.[20]\\nThe Ruth Rendell Award was introduced in 2016 by the National Literacy Trust. It is awarded to authors for their work in inspiring children and improving their literacy.[21]\\nRendell wrote two unpublished novels before the 1964 publication of From Doon with Death, which was purchased for £75 by John Long; it was the first mystery to feature Chief Inspector Reginald Wexford. Rendell said that the character of Wexford was based on herself.[22] The Monster in the Box, released in October 2009, was widely suggested to be Wexford\\'s last case.[23] This was incorrect; however it was the final novel featuring Wexford as an employed policeman. In the two following novels, The Vault and No Man\\'s Nightingale, he was retired but was still involved in police investigations as a \"consultant\".[24]\\nIn Introducing Chief Inspector Wexford by Daniel Mallory he says (based on a 1990 interview with Rendell by Marilyn Stasio) that Rendell refers to the hated Agatha (Christie) and that awful Marple woman; and says of St. Mary Mead that she can hardly bear to say the name of that village where one finds a lot of normal, law-abiding people living ordinary, blameless lives, who suddenly decide to murder their aunt. Well, I don’t believe that.[25] (Introducing Chief Inspector Wexford by Daniel Mallory; from 1990 Rendell interview with Marilyn Stasio)\\nIn addition to these police procedurals starring Wexford, Rendell wrote psychological crime novels exploring such themes as romantic obsession, misperceived communication, the impact of chance and coincidence, and the humanity of the criminals involved. Among such books are A Judgement in Stone, The Face of Trespass, Live Flesh, Talking to Strange Men, The Killing Doll, Going Wrong and Adam and Eve and Pinch Me. For the last novel published in her lifetime, The Girl Next Door, she returned to the Loughton of her childhood, with an implied comparison of the moral climate of wartime England and 2014.\\nRendell created a third strand of writing with the publication in 1986 of A Dark-Adapted Eye under her pseudonym Barbara Vine (the name was derived from her own middle name and her great-grandmother\\'s maiden name).[4] King Solomon\\'s Carpet, A Fatal Inversion and Asta\\'s Book (alternative U.S. title, Anna\\'s Book), among others, inhabited the same territory as her psychological crime novels while further developing themes of human misunderstandings and the unintended consequences of family secrets and hidden crimes. The author was noted for her elegant prose and sharp insights into the human mind, as well as her cogent plots and characters. Rendell injected the social changes of the last 40 years into her work, bringing awareness to such issues as domestic violence.[26]\\nThe Inspector Wexford series was successfully televised, starring George Baker as Inspector Wexford and Christopher Ravenscroft as Detective Mike Burden, under the title The Ruth Rendell Mysteries, with 48 episodes from 1987 to 2000.  Rendell praised Baker\\'s performance, stating \"It was a marvellous achievement as an actor to make him more and better than the author intended.\"[22] Many of her other works have been adapted for film and television. She said that Claude Chabrol\\'s 1995 version of A Judgement in Stone, La Cérémonie with Sandrine Bonnaire, was one of the few film adaptations of her work that she was happy with. The novel was also filmed in 1986 with Rita Tushingham.[27] Chabrol made La Demoiselle d\\'honneur in 2004, based on The Bridesmaid.\\nOther adaptations are Diary of the Dead (1976), from the book One Across, Two Down; the 1997 Pedro Almodóvar film Live Flesh;[28] The Tree of Hands, directed by Giles Foster for Granada with Lauren Bacall (U.S. title: \"Innocent Victim\"); and another version of  The Tree of Hands, Betty Fisher et autres histoires (2001, a.k.a. Alias Betty), with screenplay and direction by Claude Miller. François Ozon\\'s 2015 film The New Girlfriend was based on Rendell\\'s short story of the same name.[29] Two episodes of Tales of the Unexpected were based on Rendell\\'s short stories - \"A Glowing Future\" (series 4, episode 15) and \"People Don\\'t Do Such Things\" (series 8, episode 1).\\nA critical essay on Rendell\\'s crime novels appears in S. T. Joshi\\'s book Varieties of Crime Fiction (Wildside Press, 2019) ISBN\\xa0978-1-4794-4546-2.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nHerbert Russell Wakefield (1888 – 2 August 1964)[1] was an English short-story writer, novelist, publisher, and civil servant chiefly remembered today for his ghost stories.\\nWakefield was the third of four children of the clergyman Henry Russell Wakefield, who would become bishop of Birmingham in 1911. Born in Sandgate, Kent, he was educated at Marlborough College before attending University College, Oxford, where he took second-class honours in Modern History and played first-class cricket, golf, hockey and football. From 1912 to 1914 he was secretary to Viscount Northcliffe; he then served with the Royal Scots Fusiliers in France and the Balkans during World War I, attaining the rank of captain. During the war, Wakefield called on the British government to use Chinese workers to assist the UK war effort.[2]\\nWakefield served as his father\\'s secretary in 1920, when he accompanied the bishop on a lengthy tour of America. There he met and married Barbara Standish Waldo, an American woman whose parents were reputed to be wealthy. The Wakefields settled in London, where Wakefield went to work as a chief editor for the book publisher William Collins, Sons and Co., and she worked as a nurse. They were divorced in 1936, and in 1946 Wakefield was married again, to Jessica Sidney Davey.[3] His experiences in the publishing world provided him with background material for several unusual and eerie tales, including \"Messrs Turkes and Talbot\".\\nShortly before he died in Kensington, London, Wakefield\\'s wife wrote to August Derleth that her husband had destroyed his correspondence files, manuscripts and all photographs of himself.[citation needed]\\nWakefield\\'s ghost stories were published in several collections during the course of his long writing career: They Return at Evening (1928), Old Man\\'s Beard: Fifteen Disturbing Tales (1929), Imagine a Man in a Box (1931), Ghost Stories (1932), A Ghostly Company (1935), The Clock Strikes Twelve: Tales of the Supernatural (1940), and Strayers from Sheol (1961). In 1946, August Derleth\\'s Arkham House issued an expanded version of The Clock Strikes Twelve for the U.S. market; they were also the publishers of Strayers from Sheol. In 1978, John Murray published The Best Ghost Stories of H. Russell Wakefield, edited by Richard Dalby, which spanned Wakefield\\'s career and featured some previously uncollected tales. A series of collections comprising his complete output of published ghost stories were produced in the 1990s by Ash-Tree Press in limited editions that quickly went out of print. Ash-Tree also published a volume of previously unpublished stories, Reunion at Dawn and Other Uncollected Ghost Stories, in 2000.\\nWakefield\\'s supernatural fiction was strongly influenced by the work of M. R. James and Algernon Blackwood.[4] \"The Red Lodge\", \"The Thirteenth Hole at Duncaster\", \"Blind Man\\'s Buff\", \"\\'Look Up There!\\'\" and \"\\'He Cometh and He Passeth By!\\'\" are among his most widely anthologised tales.\\nWakefield is best known for his ghost stories, but he produced work outside the field. He was greatly interested in the criminal mind and wrote two non-fiction criminology studies, The Green Bicycle Case (1930) (about a 1919 death in Leicestershire) and Landru: The French Bluebeard (1936). He also wrote three detective novels: Hearken to the Evidence (1933), Belt of Suspicion (1936) and Hostess of Death (1938).\\nIn 1968, BBC Television produced a dramatization of Wakefield\\'s supernatural story \"The Triumph of Death\", starring Claire Bloom and now thought to have been wiped, for the series Late Night Horror.\\nMany critics consider Wakefield one of the great masters of the supernatural horror tale; his atmospheric work in the field has been frequently compared to that of M. R. James. August Derleth called him \"the last major representative of a ghost story tradition that began with Sheridan Le Fanu and reached its peak with Montague Rhodes James\".[5] John Betjeman noted, \"M. R. James is the greatest master of the ghost story. Henry James, Sheridan Le Fanu and H. Russell Wakefield are equal seconds.\"[6] M. R. James himself was slightly more reserved in his praise, calling They Return at Evening \"a mixed bag, from which I should remove one or two that leave a nasty taste\" but also saying the book had \"some admirable pieces, very inventive\".[7] H. P. Lovecraft said that Wakefield \"manages now and then to hit great heights of horror despite a vitiating air of sophistication\".[8] Franz Rottensteiner described Wakefield as \"perhaps the last ... representative of the classic ghost story writer\" and said that Wakefield\\'s ghost stories have \"a certain power\".[9] The horror historian R. S. Hadji included Wakefield\\'s \"The Frontier Guards\" on his list of the most frightening horror stories.[10] On the other hand, S. T. Joshi\\'s view of Wakefield was negative: he has referred to Wakefield as \"the mediocre H. Russell Wakefield\".[11]\\nCriticism of Wakefield\\'s work is scattered and uncollected. The majority of it exists in reprints of his collections, in brief articles in reference books, and in surveys such as Jack Sullivan\\'s Elegant Nightmares: The English Ghost Story from Le Fanu to Blackwood (1978). Appraisals can be found in Supernatural Fiction Writers (Scribners, 1985), the St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers (St. James Press, 1998), and Supernatural Literature of the World (Greenwood Press, 2005).\\nSource:[12]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nJoseph Aloysius Wambaugh, Jr. (born January 22, 1937)[1] is a best-selling American writer known for his fictional and nonfictional accounts of police work in the United States. Many of his novels are set in Los Angeles and its surroundings and feature Los Angeles police officers as protagonists. He has been nominated for four Edgar Awards (winning three), and was named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America.[2]\\nThe son of a police officer, Wambaugh was born in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He joined the U.S. Marine Corps at age 17 and married at 18. Wambaugh is of Irish and German descent.[3]\\nWambaugh received an associate of arts degree from Chaffey College and joined the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in 1960. He served for 14 years, rising from patrolman to detective sergeant. He also attended Cal State Los Angeles, where he earned BA and MA degrees.\\nWambaugh\\'s perspective on police work led to his first novel, The New Centurions, which was published early in 1971 to critical acclaim and popular success,  while Wambaugh was still a detective. He later quipped that suspects would ask for his autograph.[4]\\nSoon turning to writing full time, Wambaugh was prolific and popular starting in the 1970s.  He mixed writing novels (The Blue Knight, The Choirboys, The Black Marble) with nonfiction accounts of crime and detection (true crime): The Onion Field.  His later books included The Glitter Dome (a TV-movie adaptation that starred James Garner and John Lithgow), The Delta Star, and Lines and Shadows.\\nIn contrast to conventionally heroic fictional policemen, Wambaugh brought a gritty texture to his flawed police characters.  Beginning with The Choirboys, Wambaugh changed his approach and began to use dark humor and outrageous incidents to emphasize the psychological peril inherent in modern urban police work.  Many characters are referenced by often unflattering nicknames rather than given names, while other characters are given whimsical names to paint an immediate word portrait for the reader.  Wambaugh became sharply critical of the command structure of the LAPD and individuals within it, and later, of the city government as well. The character Deputy Chief Digby Bates in The Black Marble, for example, is likely a thinly veiled lampoon of Chief Daryl Gates.\\nBeginning with The Black Marble in 1977, Wambaugh devoted at least half of a narrative to satirical observations of the mores and extravagances of the Southern California \"rich and famous\" lifestyle. The Black Marble parodied dog shows and the fading lifestyle of \"old\" Pasadena, but not entirely unsympathetically. The Glitter Dome explored the pornographic film industry, The Delta Star delved into the politics and intrigue of the Nobel Prize and scientific research, and The Secrets of Harry Bright savaged the Palm Springs lifestyle of wealthy people with second homes, inclinations to drugs and drinking, and restricted country clubs.[5] The Secrets... was also a rather grim testimony to how fathers coped with the loss of a child. With The Golden Orange, set in Orange County; Finnegan\\'s Week, set in San Diego; and Floaters, set in San Diego within the events of the America\\'s Cup yacht racing, Wambaugh broadened the scope of his observations.  He was a sharp observer of locations where he lived as a current celebrity himself.\\nIn 1992, Wambaugh generated controversy with his nonfiction book Echoes in the Darkness, based on the murder of Susan Reinert, a teacher in the Upper Merion School District in suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Critics alleged that the author paid prosecutors in the trial of principal Jay C. Smith to funnel information to him before an arrest was made.[6] Smith\\'s conviction was overturned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on the grounds that the prosecution hid the existence of sand that could have supported Smith\\'s case. The chief investigator, John J. Holtz of the Pennsylvania State Police, later admitted having accepted $50,000 from author Wambaugh.[7] Smith sued the police for collusion to falsely convict him, but lost after a federal appeals court concluded that despite his release, evidence of his guilt remained overwhelming. The earlier murder conviction of Smith\\'s alleged co-conspirator, William Bradfield, remained undisturbed. Bradfield died in prison.\\nOne of Wambaugh\\'s most known nonfiction books is The Blooding, which tells the story behind an early landmark case in which DNA fingerprinting helped solve two murders in Leicester, England.[8] The DNA evidence resulted in the arrest and conviction of Colin Pitchfork.\\nIn 2003, Fire Lover: A True Story brought Wambaugh his second Edgar Award, for Best Crime Fact book.  In 2004, he received an MWA Grand Master Award.[9]\\nIn the 2000s, Wambaugh also began teaching screenwriting courses as a guest lecturer for the theater department at the University of California, San Diego.[10]\\nIn 2006, Wambaugh returned to fiction with the publication of Hollywood Station, set in the summer of 2006. It was his first novel since Floaters (1996) – and his first to depict the officers and detectives of LAPD since The Delta Star (1983). Hollywood Station was highly critical of conditions caused by the federal consent decree under which the LAPD had to operate after the Rampart scandal.  In 2008, he followed it with Hollywood Crows, a sequel featuring Hollywood Division Community Relations Officers (\"Crows\") that featured many of the same characters.  This was followed by Hollywood Moon in 2009, Hollywood Hills in 2010, and Harbor Nocturne in 2012, set in successive calendar years and involving officers of Hollywood Station\\'s midwatch (5:00\\xa0pm to 3:00\\xa0am).\\nThe only recurring characters to appear in all five books of the series are \"Hollywood Nate\" Weiss, a cop with dreams of movie stardom; \"Flotsam\" and \"Jetsam\", two cops who are avid surfers and always speak in a thick surfer lingo; and \"Compassionate Charlie\" Gilford, a lazy night-watch detective who functions as a sardonic Greek chorus.\\nThe incidents in which the various police characters are involved are based in part on anecdotes Wambaugh collects from working police officers.[11]\\nMany of his books were made into feature films or TV movies during the 1970s and 1980s.  The New Centurions was a theatrical film starring George C. Scott released in 1972. The Blue Knight, a novel following the approaching retirement and last working days of aging veteran beat cop \"Bumper\" Morgan, was made into an Emmy-winning 1973 TV miniseries starring William Holden.  It was also adapted as a short-lived TV series starring George Kennedy.  Wambaugh made a brief appearance in the pilot as a desk sergeant.   Wambaugh\\'s realistic approach to police drama was highly influential in both film and television depictions (such as Hill Street Blues) from the mid-1970s onward.\\nWambaugh was also involved with creating/developing the NBC series Police Story, which ran from 1973 to 1978. The anthology show covered the different aspects of police work (patrol, detective, undercover, etc.) in the LAPD, with story ideas and characters supposedly inspired by off-the-record talks with actual police officers.  At times, the show\\'s characters also dealt with problems not usually seen or associated with typical TV cop shows, such as alcohol abuse, adultery, and brutality.  Wambaugh appeared in his second brief acting role in the second-season episode \"Incident in the Kill Zone\".  The show had a brief revival on ABC during the 1988–1989 season.\\nWambaugh was also involved in the production of the film versions of The Onion Field (1979) and The Black Marble (1980), both directed by Harold Becker.  In 1981, he won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for his screenplay for the latter film.  The Choirboys film adaptation had met with poor critical and audience reception a few years earlier. All three films featured performances by then up-and-coming actor James Woods.\\nThe Glitter Dome, which starred James Garner, John Lithgow and Margot Kidder, was a 1984 film for HBO.[12]\\nFugitive Nights was made into a 1993 feature film of the same title.[13]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nCharles Harding Wells (August 2, 1923 – October 10, 2004) was an American crime novelist and protégé of Mickey Spillane. He wrote two novels, 1953\\'s Let the Night Cry and 1955\\'s The Last Kill.\\nWells was born on August 2, 1923, in Greenwood, Mississippi, the son of Terrell Rush Wells and Emma Jones Harding Wells. He attended Georgia Institute of Technology, Mississippi State College, and Tulane University.[1] Before beginning his writing career, he worked as a draftsman, drummer, and bank messenger, and was stationed in Europe during the Second World War, where he served in a field artillery unit and anti-aircraft battalion.[2] He married Annie Lou Turner, a Greenwood librarian, in 1956.[3] He lived in Greenwood until his death, on October 10, 2004, from heart failure.[4]\\nGrowing up in Greenwood, Wells was a childhood friend of Mary Ann Pearce, who would later marry Mickey Spillane. Wells, Spillane, and fellow Spillane protégé Earle Basinsky met while Spillane was stationed in Greenwood while serving in the Army.[5] In the early 1950s, when Spillane himself had semi-retired from writing,[6] Wells lived for a time in the Spillane household, where the elder writer took him under his wing. (Wells and fellow writer Joe Gill can be seen in a photograph in a 1952 Life magazine article on Spillane.) After working with Spillane for a year, Wells published his first novel, Let the Night Cry, at New American Library\\'s Signet Books imprint, which also produced Spillane\\'s Mike Hammer paperbacks.[6]\\nAs he did with several other young writers,[7] Spillane supported Wells\\' work with advice, encouragement, and cover blurbs praising Wells on both of his novels. Wells himself freely acknowledged Spillane\\'s influence, writing in The Last Kill that \"it was Mickey himself who showed me how to pack guts, gore and hot, suspenseful action into a mystery yarn.\"[8]\\nLet the Night Cry, published in 1953, is a crime thriller about an ex-convict set in New Orleans,[2] which a New York Times reviewer said that Wells described as \"a city seemingly consisting entirely of bars and night clubs.\"[9] An Oakland Tribune reviewer described the book as  \"crime, love and dope in a chili-hot potpourri in New Orleans\\' picturesque and wicked Latin Quarter.\"[10] The book sold more than 400,000 copies.[11]\\nThe Last Kill, published in 1955, is set in Memphis, Tennessee and follows a private eye who is trying to solve the murder of a friend who was involved in a million-dollar bank heist.[2] August West, reviewing the novel on the blog Vintage Hardboiled Reads, noted that \"what Wells did well is create a gloomy, drab, dark atmosphere for the novel. Very noir-ish. The whole story takes place in rainy, cold weather and mostly at night.\"[12]\\nThe original cover illustrations of Wells\\' novels, both done by artist Robert Maguire, have been called some of \"the most evocative and memorable of the period\" by Lee Server, author of the Encyclopedia of Pulp Fiction Writers.[6]\\nCritical appraisals of Wells\\' books were positive but not enthusiastic. Bill Pronzini, in 1001 Midnights: The Aficionado\\'s Guide To Mystery and Detective Fiction, called them \"readable\" but \"Spillane-imitative.\"[13] The New York Times Book Review called the hero of  The Last Kill \"the year\\'s most incompetent private detective\" but said the book would appeal to \"addicts of Spillane.\"[14] Even Wells\\' publisher had mixed feelings about his literary quality, if not his marketability: New American Library owner Victor Weybright overturned the original rejection of the novel, but in the same letter authorizing its publication, he called the book \"God-awful trash, without Spillane\\'s vibration and without plausible motivation, but abounding in  retribution, lust, violence, booze, in the lower depths of New York and environs.\"[15]\\nWells did not publish again after The Last Kill.[13] Server states that \"apparently even Mickey lost track of him.\"[6]\\n',\n",
       " 'Donald Edwin Westlake (July 12, 1933 – December 31, 2008) was an American writer with more than one hundred novels and non-fiction books to his credit. He specialized in crime fiction, especially comic capers, with an occasional foray into science fiction and other genres. Westlake created two professional criminal characters who each starred in a long-running series: the relentless, hardboiled Parker (published under the pen name Richard Stark), and John Dortmunder, who featured in a more humorous series.[1]\\nHe was a three-time Edgar Award winner and, alongside Joe Gores and William L. DeAndrea, was one of few writers to win Edgars in three different categories (1968, Best Novel, God Save the Mark; 1990, Best Short Story, \"Too Many Crooks\"; 1991, Best Motion Picture Screenplay, The Grifters). In 1993, the Mystery Writers of America named Westlake a Grand Master, the highest honor bestowed by the society.[2]\\nWestlake was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Lillian (Bounds) and Albert Joseph Westlake,[3] and was raised in Albany, New York.\\nWestlake wrote constantly in his teens, and after 200 rejections, his first short story sale was in 1954. Sporadic short story sales followed over the next few years, while Westlake attended Champlain College (a now defunct college created in the post WWII GI Bill boom) of Plattsburgh, New York,[4] and Binghamton University in Binghamton, New York. He also spent two years in the United States Air Force.\\nWestlake moved to New York City in 1959, initially to work for a literary agency while writing on the side.  By 1960, he was writing full-time.  His first novel under his own name, The Mercenaries, was published in 1960; over the next 48 years, Westlake published a variety of novels and short stories under his own name and a number of pseudonyms.\\nHe was married three times, the final time to Abigail Westlake (also known as Abby Adams Westlake and Abby Adams), a writer of nonfiction (her two published books are An Uncommon Scold and The Gardener\\'s Gripe Book). The couple moved from New York City to Ancram in upstate New York in 1990.\\nWestlake died of a heart attack on December 31, 2008, while on the way to a New Year\\'s Eve dinner in Mexico, where he and his wife were on vacation.[5]\\nIn addition to writing consistently under his own name, Westlake published under several pseudonyms.[6] In the order they debuted:\\nWestlake sometimes made playful use of his pseudonyms in his work:\\nAdditionally, Westlake conducted a mock \"interview\" with Richard Stark, Tucker Coe and Timothy J. Culver in an article for the non-fiction book Murder Ink: The Mystery Reader\\'s Companion.\\nDonald Westlake was known for the great ingenuity of his plots and the audacity of his gimmicks. Westlake\\'s most famous characters include the hard-boiled criminal Parker (appearing in fiction under the Richard Stark pseudonym) and Parker\\'s comic flip-side John Dortmunder. Westlake was quoted as saying that he originally intended what became The Hot Rock to be a straightforward Parker novel, but \"It kept turning funny,\" and thus became the first John Dortmunder novel.\\nMost of Donald Westlake\\'s novels are set in New York City. In each of the Dortmunder novels, there is typically a foray into a particular city neighborhood. He wrote just two non-fiction books: Under an English Heaven, regarding the unlikely 1967 Anguillan \"revolution\", and a biography of Elizabeth Taylor.[6]\\nWestlake was an occasional contributor to science fiction fanzines such as Xero, and used Xero as a venue for a harsh announcement that he was leaving the science fiction field.[12]\\nWestlake and Joe Gores wrote the same encounter between two of their characters from different perspectives in two different novels. In chapter 18 of Gores\\' 1972 novel Dead Skip, San Francisco detective Dan Kearney meets Westlake\\'s amoral thief Parker while looking for one of Parker\\'s associates. The sequence is described from Parker\\'s viewpoint in the 1972 book Plunder Squad, which Westlake wrote under the pseudonym Richard Stark. Gores hints further at the connection between the two books by referring to Parker\\'s associates as \"the plunder squad.\"  Additionally, earlier in the novel, the book\\'s protagonist Larry Ballard is described as being a reader only of Richard Stark novels.[13]\\nGores and Westlake also wrote a shared chapter in Westlake\\'s Drowned Hopes and Gores\\' 32 Cadillacs, having the characters in those books influenced by the same event.[14][15]\\nSeveral of Westlake\\'s novels have been made into motion pictures: 1967\\'s Point Blank (based on The Hunter) with Lee Marvin as Parker (changed to Walker); Mise à sac\\xa0[fr] (based on The Score) with Michel Constantin as Parker (changed to Georges), also in 1967; 1968\\'s The Split (from the book The Seventh) with Jim Brown as Parker (changed to McClain); The Hot Rock in 1972 with Robert Redford; Cops and Robbers in 1973; The Outfit with Robert Duvall as Parker (changed to Macklin), also in 1973; Bank Shot in 1974 with George C.

Neither the film\\'s producer nor Godard purchased the rights to the novel, so Westlake successfully sued to prevent the film\\'s commercial distribution in the United States.[citation needed]\\nHis novel Memory, published posthumously in 2010, was adapted into the upcoming film The Actor, directed by Duke Johnson and starring André Holland and Gemma Chan.[16][17]\\nWestlake was himself a screenwriter. His script for the 1990 film The Grifters, adapted from the novel by Jim Thompson, was nominated for an Academy Award. Westlake adapted Jim Thompson\\'s work in a straightforward manner, but Westlake the humourist played on Thompson\\'s name later that year in the Dortmunder novel Drowned Hopes by featuring a character named \"Tom Jimson\" who is a criminal psychopath. Westlake also wrote the screenplay for the film The Stepfather (from a story by Westlake, Brian Garfield and Carolyn Lefcourt), which was popular enough to inspire two sequels and a remake, projects in which Westlake was not involved.[citation needed]\\nIn 1987 Westlake wrote the teleplay Fatal Confession, a pilot for the TV series Father Dowling Mysteries based on the novels by Ralph McInerny. He also appeared in a small role (as the mystery writer Rich Vincent) in the third-season episode, \"The Hardboiled Mystery.\"[citation needed]\\nWestlake wrote an early draft of the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough, which was later scrapped because of difficulties in filming in the script\\'s original setting in China. Westlake adapted the script into the novel Forever and a Death, which was published posthumously in 2017 by Hard Case Crime.[18]\\nWestlake wrote an unproduced screenplay adapting the Dashiell Hammett crime novel Red Harvest, which changed the story considerably to refocus the ending on solving the original murder for which the detective had been hired, which is solved relatively early in the original book and which Westlake felt made the detective\\'s continuing involvement in the story hard to justify.[18]\\nWestlake co-wrote the story for the pilot of the ill-fated 1979 TV series Supertrain with teleplay writer Earl W. Wallace; Westlake and Wallace shared \"created by\" credit.[citation needed]\\nIn 2022, Variety (magazine) reported that Robert Downey, Jr. and Shane Black were working together on multiple movie and television projects for Amazon Studios based on the Parker series.[19]\\nWestlake has been acknowledged by many writers and fans of crime fiction as one of the masters of the genre.\\nThe central villain of Stephen King\\'s novel The Dark Half, George Stark, was named in honor of Richard Stark. King telephoned Westlake personally to ask permission. King\\'s own \"Richard Bachman\" pseudonym was also partly named for Stark: King had been reading a Richard Stark novel at the time he chose the pen name.[25]\\nWriter Duane Swierczynski named his first-born son Parker, in honor of the Richard Stark character as well as Spider-Man\\'s secret identity, Peter Parker.[26][27]\\nIn addition to Darwyn Cooke\\'s graphic-novel adaptations of Parker, Cooke also homaged Westlake in his earlier work Catwoman: Selena\\'s Big Score by giving one of the characters, an old flame and mentor of Selina Kyle, the name \"Stark\" as well as the face of Lee Marvin, who played the Parker character in Point Blank.[28][29]\\n',\n",

Miss Silver works closely with Scotland Yard, especially Inspector Frank Abbott, and is fond of quoting the poet Tennyson. Miss Silver is sometimes compared to Jane Marple, the elderly detective created by Agatha Christie.[6] \"Miss Silver is well known in the better circles of society, and she finds entree to the troubled households of the upper classes with little difficulty.

       " '\\nStuart Woods (born Stuart Chevalier Lee; January 9, 1938 – July 22, 2022)[1] was an American novelist,[2] known best for his first novel Chiefs and his series of novels featuring the Stone Barrington character.\\nStuart Woods was born in Manchester, Georgia, and graduated in 1959 from the University of Georgia, with a Bachelor of Arts in sociology. After graduation, he enrolled in the Air National Guard, spending two months in basic training before moving to New York City, where he began a career in the advertising industry.[3] Towards the end of the 1960s, Woods emigrated to England and lived in Knightsbridge, London while continuing to work in advertising. After three years in London, Woods decided to write a novel, based on an old family story that had been told to him when he was a child, and moved to Ireland.[3] He moved into a converted barn on the grounds of Lough Cutra Castle near Gort, County Galway, and lived a near-solitary existence, except for spending two days a week in Dublin writing television commercials and print advertisements.[3]\\nSoon after settling in Ireland in 1973, Woods took up a new hobby of sailing, an activity that had interested him since the summer of 1966 in Castine, Maine, when friends had taken him on their boat.[3] He joined Galway Bay Sailing Club, and learned to sail in one of the club\\'s Mirrors.[4] Woods purchased a Mirror for himself and named it Fred, after his dog.[5] After tiring of cruising around bays, he entered novice competitions around Galway Bay. Unable to find a reliable person to form his crew, Woods recruited any passing teenager to join him.[6] He entered the week-long National Championships at Lough Derg, and finished 39th out of a fleet of 60. It was Woods\\' best result of the season.[7]\\nThe following year, Woods sailed in as many races as he could leading up to the Mirror National Championships in Sligo. After retiring from the first race, he finished in 25th place out of 70 boats in the second race, and finished eighth in the third race. The fourth race was cancelled due to high winds and the number of teenaged entrants. He finished the event 29th out of 70 boats, and his crewmate and he were given a special prize for being the oldest and heaviest crew.[8] For the rest of the season, he sailed around Ireland with a friend on a Snapdragon 24, and decided to compete in the 1976 Observer Single-handed Trans-Atlantic Race (OSTAR).[9]\\nIn the fall of 1974, Woods\\'s grandfather died and bequeathed him enough money to buy a yacht suitable for the race. He ordered a Golden Shamrock-based yacht from Ron Holland, and worked with him on designing the interior suitable for single-handed racing and Woods\\' personal needs.[10] Since his previous sailing experience consisted of \"racing a 10-foot plywood dinghy on Sunday afternoons against small children, losing regularly\",[11] Woods spent 18 months learning more about sailing and celestial navigation, while his yacht was being built in Cork.[12] He gained more boating experience by sailing from Ireland to England as part of the crew on STY Creidne, a training ship purchased by the Irish government for the Irish Naval Service, Irish Mist II, Ron Holland\\'s  Golden Apple, and as many other yachts that would accept him, amassing 1200 miles of offshore experience.[13] He entered the August 1975 Multihull Offshore Cruising and Racing Association (MOCRA) Azores Race and asked fellow Galway Bay Sailing Club member Commander Bill King to join him.[14]\\nTo finance his MOCRA Azores Race and the OSTAR, Woods met with publishers about writing a book about his experience in the OSTAR,[15] organized sponsorship for the races, and sent invitations and press releases about the launch of his yacht to the local and national Irish media, RTÉ, The Observer, and Yachting Monthly.[16] Golden Harp was launched June 4, 1975. \"Golden\" was chosen so the boat followed the naming tradition of Ron Holland\\'s other designs, the Golden Apple, Golden Shamrock, and Golden Delicious, and \"Harp\" as it has long been used as a symbol of Ireland.[17]\\nWoods, King, and their third crewmember, Shirley Clifford,[18] left from Portsmouth, England, for the Azores in August 1975.[19] Clifford, who had complained of feeling ill the day before the race began, continued to feel worse, so Woods and King dropped her off on a coast guard boat near Plymouth, England, on the second day of the race.[20] They arrived in Horta after sailing 1400 miles for 151⁄2 days.[21] They were the smallest and last boat to finish, other than four boats that had retired from the race, but were disqualified for not competing with the full crew complement that had begun the race.[22] King returned to Ireland almost immediately, but Woods spent a month in Horta before sailing Golden Harp the 1300 miles back to Ireland single-handedly  to meet the OSTAR\\'s qualifying cruise requirement of a minimum of 500 miles.[23]\\nUpon his return to Ireland in the late fall of 1975, Woods appeared on the Irish version of To Tell the Truth with Ron Holland and John McWilliam. All three men claimed to be Woods, and a panel had to guess who was lying. Only one of the four panelists guessed correctly.[24] Preparing for his OSTAR race, he petitioned the OSTAR Committee to be considered an Irish entry, as although he was an American, he had been living in Ireland for some time, had learned to sail from Irish yachtsmen on Irish boats, and his yacht was Irish designed and built. The committee agreed to allow him to be entered under Irish colors.[25]\\nWoods wrote an account of his OSTAR experience, and was introduced to Stanford Maritime, a London-based publishing house specializing in nautical books, by Ron Holland. Blue Water, Green Skipper was published in 1977. The American publishing rights were sold to W.W. Norton.[26]\\nWoods\\' second book was to be written about the 1977 Round Britain Yacht Race, but the book was cancelled because of light winds and calms during the race. He persuaded his publishers to allow him to change the scope of the book, and spent the summer driving 12,000 miles around Great Britain and Ireland, writing a guidebook to country restaurants, inns, and hotels.[27] He visited over 150 establishments, and included 138 in the book; 91 establishments in England, 13 in Scotland, eight in Wales, and 26 in Ireland.[28] The two places in the British Isles that he did not visit were Northern Ireland, saying that he did not feel comfortable recommending any place where he was afraid to visit, and the Channel Islands due to a lack of available time.[29] Originally titled A Lover\\'s Guide to the Country Inns of Britain and Ireland Woods realised married couples may feel alienated, and changed it to A Romantic\\'s Guide ...,[28] defining a \"romantic\" as a person \" who is susceptible to charm\" in addition to The Concise Oxford Dictionary\\'s definition of someone \"given to romance, imagination ... visionary ... professing grandeur of picturesqueness or passion or irregular beauty to finish and proportion.\"[30]\\nWoods\\' first novel, Chiefs, was published in March 1981. The story was inspired by a police chief\\'s badge Woods had found in his grandmother\\'s home. The badge was stained with blood and pockmarked by buckshot. It had belonged to his grandfather, who died wearing it 10 years before Woods was born.[31] He submitted the first 100 pages and an outline to three publishers, all of whom turned him down, before Norton bought the publishing rights for $7,500.[26] He later stated it was a mistake to sell the book unfinished, as he could have gotten much more money had it been completed.[26] About 20,000 copies of the book were printed in hardback, but Norton did little to promote it.[26] He contracted with Bantam Books to print the paperback edition. In 1983, Chiefs was adapted into a television miniseries of the same name, starring Charlton Heston, Danny Glover, Billy Dee Williams, Stephen Collins, and John Goodman. CBS broadcast the miniseries over three nights, and it was nominated for three Emmy Awards and one Eddie Award.[32][33] Its success sparked interest in the paperback,[26] and Woods was awarded the Edgar Award in the \"Best First Novel\" category from the Mystery Writers of America.[34]\\nWoods\\' most prolific series of novels focus on Stone Barrington, a former NYPD detective turned lawyer, who is of counsel to a prestigious law firm and handles sensitive cases for the firm\\'s prominent clients, but cases with which the firm nonetheless does not wish to be publicly associated. As such, Barrington commands exorbitant fees, and a strong cast of recurring characters such as his ex-partner Dino Bacchetti, frequent use of the restaurant Elaine\\'s on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City as a setting, and Stone\\'s frequent exploits with women, travel, and fine dining. Stone, like Woods, was also an experienced pilot and frequent references are made to his aircraft.[citation needed]\\nIn addition to Stone, Woods authored several other character-focused series, including Holly Barker, a retired Army major and Florida police chief recruited to become a CIA operative; Ed Eagle, a Santa Fe defense lawyer; William Henry Lee IV, a United States senator from Georgia who is elected President of the United States; and Rick Barron, a police detective who becomes a security officer and later chief of production for a Hollywood movie studio in the 1930s. All of Woods\\' novels take place in the same universe, and characters frequently appear in other series.\\nWoods has published a memoir, a travel book, and 44 novels in a 37-year career, and had 29 consecutive The New York Times best sellers in hardback. Two completed novels were awaiting publication in January and April, 2011, and he then signed another three-book deal with Putnam. At one time in his literary output, Woods wrote two novels a year and subsequently increased that to three novels a year, at the request of his publishers.[35] In 2014, he started publishing four times a year, in January, April, June/July, and October.\\nWoods was a licensed, instrument-rated private pilot and bought a new Cessna Citation Mustang, his first jet airplane. He was the launch customer of the Cessna Citation M2, taking delivery of the plane in December 2013.[36]  He owned a Hinckley T38 R power boat and was a partner in an 85-foot antique motor yacht, Enticer, built in 1935 and fully restored. Married to Jeanmarie (née Cooper) in January 2013, the couple lived with a Labrador Retriever named Fred in Key West, Florida, on Mount Desert Island, in Maine, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.[37]\\n-These novels also feature Stone Barrington-\\nUnintended Consequences\\n',\n",
       " 'Seishi Yokomizo (Japanese: 横溝 正史, Hepburn: Yokomizo Seishi, 24 May 1902 – 28 December 1981) was a Japanese mystery novelist, known for creating the fictional detective Kosuke Kindaichi.\\nYokomizo was born in the city of Kobe, Hyōgo Prefecture. He read detective stories as a boy and in 1921, while employed by the Daiichi Bank, published his first story in the popular magazine Shin Seinen (\"New Youth\"). He graduated from Osaka Pharmaceutical College (currently part of Osaka University) with a degree in pharmacy, and initially intended to take over his family\\'s drug store. However, drawn by his interest in literature, and the encouragement of Edogawa Rampo, he went to Tokyo instead. There he was hired by the Hakubunkan publishing company in 1926. After serving as editor in chief of several magazines, he resigned in 1932 to devote himself full time to writing.\\nYokomizo was attracted to the literary genre of historical fiction, especially that of the historical detective novel. In July 1934, while resting in the mountains of Nagano to recuperate from tuberculosis, he completed his first novel Onibi, which was published in 1935, although parts were immediately censored by the authorities. Undeterred, Yokomizo followed on his early success with a second novel Ningyo Sashichi torimonocho (1938–1939). \\nDuring World War II, he faced difficulties in getting his works published and was in severe financial difficulties. The lack of Streptomycin and other antibiotics also meant that his tuberculosis could not be properly treated, and he joked with friends that it was a race to see whether he would die of disease or of starvation.\\nSoon after the end of World War II, his works received wide recognition and he developed an enormous fan following. He published many works as serials in Kodansha\\'s Weekly Shōnen Magazine, concentrating only on popular mystery novels based on the orthodox western detective story format, starting with Honjin Satsujin Jiken (The Honjin Murders) and Chōchō Satsujin Jinken (both in 1946). His works became the model for many other postwar Japanese mystery writers. He was also often called the \"Japanese John Dickson Carr\" after a writer whom he admired[citation needed]. Yokomizo is most well known for creating the private detective Kosuke Kindaichi. \\nMany of his works have been made into movies. In particular, The Inugami Clan (犬神家の一族, Inugamike no Ichizoku, January 1950 - May 1951) received two film adaptations by Kon Ichikawa: The Inugami Family in 1976, and his 2006 remake The Inugamis. \\nThe scholar Mari Kotani called his 1939 story The Death\\'s Head Stranger (髑髏検校, Dokuro-Kengyo) \"the first successful adaptation of Bram Stoker\\'s Dracula\" and \"the archetype of Japanese vampire literature.\"[1]\\nYokomizo died of colon cancer in 1981. His grave is at the Shunjuen Cemetery in Kawasaki, Kanagawa.\\nIn 2018 a literature professor found a previously missing piece of Yokomizo\\'s wartime serial romance story \"Yukiwariso,\" completing the manuscript for publication in book form.[2]\\nThe Yokomizo Seishi Prize is a literary award established in 1980 by the Kadokawa Shoten publishing company and the Tokyo Broadcasting System in honor of Yokomizo. It is awarded annually to a previously unpublished novel-length mystery. The winner receives a statuette of Kosuke Kindaichi and a cash award of ¥10,000,000, making it one of the richest literary prizes in the world. In addition, the winning story is published by Kadokawa Shoten and dramatized as a television movie by TBS.\\n',\n",

       " 'Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detective—whether professional, amateur or retired—investigates a crime, often murder. The detective genre began around the same time as speculative fiction and other genre fiction in the mid-nineteenth century and has remained extremely popular, particularly in novels.[1] Some of the most famous heroes of detective fiction include C. Auguste Dupin, Sherlock Holmes, and Hercule Poirot. Juvenile stories featuring The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, and The Boxcar Children have also remained in print for several decades.\\nSome scholars, such as R. H. Pfeiffer,  have suggested that certain ancient and religious texts bear similarities to what would later be called detective fiction. In the Old Testament story of Susanna and the Elders (the Protestant Bible locates this story within the apocrypha), the account told by two witnesses broke down when Daniel cross-examines them. In response, author Julian Symons has argued that \"those who search for fragments of detection in the Bible and Herodotus are looking only for puzzles\" and that these puzzles are not detective stories.[2] In the play Oedipus Rex by Ancient Greek playwright Sophocles, Oedipus investigates the unsolved murder of King Laius and discovers the truth after questioning various witnesses that he himself is the culprit. Although \"Oedipus\\'s enquiry is based on supernatural, pre-rational methods that are evident in most narratives of crime until the development of Enlightenment thought in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\", this narrative has \"all of the central characteristics and formal elements of the detective story, including a mystery surrounding a murder, a closed circle of suspects, and the gradual uncovering of a hidden past.\"[3]\\nThe One Thousand and One Nights contains several of the earliest detective stories, anticipating modern detective fiction.[4] The oldest known example of a detective story was \"The Three Apples\", one of the tales narrated by Scheherazade in the One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights). In this story, a fisherman discovers a heavy, locked chest along the Tigris river, which he then sells to the Abbasid Caliph, Harun al-Rashid. When Harun breaks open the chest, he discovers the body of a young woman who has been cut into pieces. Harun then orders his vizier, Ja\\'far ibn Yahya, to solve the crime and to find the murderer within three days, or be executed if he fails in his assignment.[5] Suspense is generated through multiple plot twists that occur as the story progressed.[6] With these characteristics this may be considered an archetype for detective fiction.[7] It anticipates the use of reverse chronology in modern detective fiction, where the story begins with a crime before presenting a gradual reconstruction of the past.[4]\\nThe main difference between Ja\\'far (\"The Three Apples\") and later fictional detectives, such as Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot, is that Ja\\'far has no actual desire to solve the case. The whodunit mystery is solved when the murderer himself confessed his crime.[8] This in turn leads to another assignment in which Ja\\'far has to find the culprit who instigated the murder within three days or else be executed. Ja\\'far again fails to find the culprit before the deadline, but owing to chance, he discovers a key item. In the end, he manages to solve the case through reasoning in order to prevent his own execution.[9]\\nOn the other hand, two other Arabian Nights stories, \"The Merchant and the Thief\" and \"Ali Khwaja\", contain two of the earliest fictional detectives, who uncover clues and present evidence to catch or convict a criminal known to the audience, with the story unfolding in normal chronology and the criminal already known to the audience. The latter involves a climax where the titular detective protagonist Ali Khwaja presents evidence from expert witnesses in a court.[4]\\nGong\\'an fiction (公案小说, literally：\"case records of a public law court\") is the earliest known genre of Chinese detective fiction.\\nSome well-known stories include the Yuan dynasty story Circle of Chalk (Chinese: 灰闌記), the Ming dynasty story collection Bao Gong An (Chinese: 包公案) and the 18th century Di Gong An (Chinese: 狄公案) story collection. The latter was translated into English as Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee by Dutch sinologist Robert Van Gulik, who then used the style and characters to write the original Judge Dee series.\\nThe hero/detective of these novels was typically a traditional judge or similar official based on historical personages such as Judge Bao (Bao Qingtian) or Judge Dee (Di Renjie). Although the historical characters may have lived in an earlier period (such as the Song or Tang dynasty) most stories are written in the later Ming or Qing dynasty period.\\nThese novels differ from the Western style tradition in several points as described by Van Gulik:[10]\\nVan Gulik chose Di Gong An to translate because in his view it was closer to the Western literary style and more likely to appeal to non-Chinese readers.\\nA number of Gong An works may have been lost or destroyed during the Literary Inquisitions and the wars in ancient China.[11] In the traditional Chinese culture, this genre was low-prestige, and therefore was less worthy of preservation than works such as philosophy or poetry. Only little or incomplete case volumes can be found; for example, the only copy of Di Gong An was found at a second-hand book store in Tokyo, Japan.\\nOne of the earliest examples of detective fiction in Western Literature is Voltaire\\'s Zadig (1748), which features a main character who performs feats of analysis.[12] Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams (1794) by William Godwin portrays the law as protecting the murderer and destroying the innocent.[13] Thomas Skinner Sturr\\'s anonymous Richmond, or stories in the life of a Bow Street officer was published in London in 1827; the Danish crime story The Rector of Veilbye by Steen Steensen Blicher was written in 1829; and the Norwegian crime novel Mordet paa Maskinbygger Roolfsen (\"The Murder of Engine Maker Roolfsen\") by Maurits Hansen was published in December 1839.\\n\"Das Fräulein von Scuderi\" is an 1819 short story by E. T. A. Hoffmann, in which Mlle de Scudery establishes the innocence of the police\\'s favorite suspect in the murder of a jeweller. This story is sometimes cited as the first detective story and as a direct influence on Edgar Allan Poe\\'s \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841).[14] Also suggested as a possible influence on Poe is \\'The Secret Cell\\', a short story published in September 1837 by William Evans Burton. It has been suggested that this story may have been known to Poe, who in 1839 worked for Burton.[15] The story was about a London policeman who solves the mystery of a kidnapped girl. Burton\\'s fictional detective relied on practical methods such as dogged legwork, knowledge of the underworld and undercover surveillance, rather than brilliance of imagination or intellect.\\nDetective fiction in the English-speaking world is considered to have begun in 1841 with the publication of Poe\\'s \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\",[12] featuring \"the first fictional detective, the eccentric and brilliant C. Auguste Dupin\". When the character first appeared, the word detective had not yet been used in English; however, the character\\'s name, \"Dupin\", originated from the English word dupe or deception.[16] Poe devised a \"plot formula that\\'s been successful ever since, give or take a few shifting variables.\"[17] Poe followed with further Auguste Dupin tales: \"The Mystery of Marie Rogêt\" in 1842 and \"The Purloined Letter\" in 1844.\\nPoe referred to his stories as \"tales of ratiocination\".[12] In stories such as these, the primary concern of the plot is ascertaining truth, and the usual means of obtaining the truth is a complex and mysterious process combining intuitive logic, astute observation, and perspicacious inference. \"Early detective stories tended to follow an investigating protagonist from the first scene to the last, making the unravelling a practical rather than emotional matter.\"[17] \"The Mystery of Marie Rogêt\" is particularly interesting because it is a barely fictionalized account based on Poe\\'s theory of what happened to the real-life Mary Cecilia Rogers.\\nWilliam Russell (1806–1876) was among the first English authors to write fictitious \\'police memoirs\\',[18] contributing an irregular series of stories (under the pseudonym \\'Waters\\') to Chambers\\'s Edinburgh Journal between 1849 and 1852. Unauthorised collections of his stories were published in New York City in 1852 and 1853, entitled The Recollections of a Policeman.[19] Twelve stories were then collated into a volume entitled Recollections of a Detective Police-Officer, published in London in 1856.[20]\\nLiterary critic Catherine Ross Nickerson credits Louisa May Alcott with creating the second-oldest work of modern detective fiction, after only Poe\\'s Dupin stories themselves, with the 1865 thriller \"V.V., or Plots and Counterplots.\" A short story published anonymously by Alcott, the story concerns a Scottish aristocrat who tries to prove that a mysterious woman has killed his fiancée and cousin. The detective on the case, Antoine Dupres, is a parody of Auguste Dupin who is less concerned with solving the crime as he is in setting up a way to reveal the solution with a dramatic flourish. Ross Nickerson notes that many of the American writers who experimented with Poe\\'s established rules of the genre were women, inventing a subgenre of domestic detective fiction that flourished in its own right for several generations. These included Metta Fuller Victor\\'s two detective novels The Dead Letter (1867) and The Figure Eight (1869).[21] The Dead Letter is noteworthy as the first full-length work of American crime fiction.[22]\\nÉmile Gaboriau was a pioneer of the detective fiction genre in France. In Monsieur Lecoq (1868), the title character is adept at disguise, a key characteristic of detectives.[23] Gaboriau\\'s writing is also considered to contain the first example of a detective minutely examining a crime scene for clues.[24]\\nAnother early example of a whodunit is a subplot in the novel Bleak House (1853) by Charles Dickens. The conniving lawyer Tulkinghorn is killed in his office late one night, and the crime is investigated by Inspector Bucket of the Metropolitan police force. Numerous characters appeared on the staircase leading to Tulkinghorn\\'s office that night, some of them in disguise, and Inspector Bucket must penetrate these mysteries to identify the murderer. Dickens also left a novel unfinished at his death, The Mystery of Edwin Drood.[25][26]\\nDickens\\'s protégé, Wilkie Collins (1824–1889)—sometimes called the \"grandfather of English detective fiction\"—is credited with the first great mystery novel, The Woman in White. T. S. Eliot called Collins\\'s novel The Moonstone (1868) \"the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels... in a genre invented by Collins and not by Poe\",[27] and Dorothy L. Sayers called it \"probably the very finest detective story ever written\".[28] The Moonstone contains a number of ideas that have established in the genre several classic features of the 20th century detective story:\\nAlthough The Moonstone is usually seen as the first detective novel, there are other contenders for the honor. A number of critics suggest that the lesser known Notting Hill Mystery (1862–63), written by the pseudonymous \"Charles Felix\" (later identified as Charles Warren Adams[29][30]), preceded it by a number of years and first used techniques that would come to define the genre.[29][31]\\nLiterary critics Chris Willis and Kate Watson consider Mary Elizabeth Braddon\\'s first book, the even earlier The Trail of the Serpent (1861), to be the first British detective novel.[32] The Trail of the Serpent \"features an innovative detective figure, Mr. Peters, who is lower class and mute, and who is initially dismissed both by the text and its characters.\"[32] Braddon\\'s later and better-remembered work, Aurora Floyd (printed in 1863 novel form, but serialized in 1862–63[33]), also features a compelling detective in the person of Detective Grimstone of Scotland Yard.\\nTom Taylor\\'s melodrama The Ticket-of-Leave Man, an adaptation of Léonard by Édouard Brisbarre and Eugène Nus,[34] appeared in 1863, introducing Hawkshaw the Detective. In short, it is difficult to establish who was the first to write the English-language detective novel, as various authors were exploring the theme simultaneously.\\nAnna Katharine Green, in her 1878 debut The Leavenworth Case and other works, popularized the genre among middle-class readers and helped to shape the genre into its classic form as well as developed the concept of the series detective.[21][35]\\nIn 1887, Arthur Conan Doyle created Sherlock Holmes, arguably the most famous of all fictional detectives. Although Sherlock Holmes is not the original fictional detective (he was influenced by Poe\\'s Dupin and Gaboriau\\'s Lecoq), his name has become a byword for the part. Conan Doyle stated that the character of Holmes was inspired by Dr. Joseph Bell, for whom Doyle had worked as a clerk at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing large conclusions from the smallest observations.[36] A brilliant London-based \"consulting detective\" residing at 221B Baker Street, Holmes is famous for his intellectual prowess and is renowned for his skillful use of astute observation, deductive reasoning, and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes, and all but four stories are narrated by Holmes\\'s friend, assistant, and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson.\\nThe period between World War I and World War II (the 1920s and 1930s) is generally referred to as the Golden Age of Detective Fiction.[38] During this period, a number of very popular writers emerged, including mostly British but also a notable subset of American and New Zealand writers. Female writers constituted a major portion of notable Golden Age writers. Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Josephine Tey, Margery Allingham, and Ngaio Marsh were particularly famous female writers of this time.[38] Apart from Ngaio Marsh (a New Zealander), they were all British.\\nVarious conventions of the detective genre were standardized during the Golden Age, and in 1929, some of them were codified by the English Catholic priest and author of detective stories Ronald Knox in his \\'Decalogue\\' of rules for detective fiction. One of his rules was to avoid supernatural elements so that the focus remained on the mystery itself.[38] Knox has contended that a detective story \"must have as its main interest the unravelling of a mystery; a mystery whose elements are clearly presented to the reader at an early stage in the proceedings, and whose nature is such as to arouse curiosity, a curiosity which is gratified at the end.\"[39] Another common convention in Golden Age detective stories involved an outsider–sometimes a salaried investigator or a police officer, but often a gifted amateur—investigating a murder committed in a closed environment by one of a limited number of suspects.\\nThe most widespread subgenre of the detective novel became the whodunit (or whodunnit, short for \"who done it?\"). In this subgenre, great ingenuity may be exercised in narrating the crime, usually a homicide, and the subsequent investigation. This objective was to conceal the identity of the criminal from the reader until the end of the book, when the method and culprit are both revealed. According to scholars Carole Kismaric and Marvin Heiferman, \"The golden age of detective fiction began with high-class amateur detectives sniffing out murderers lurking in rose gardens, down country lanes, and in picturesque villages. Many conventions of the detective-fiction genre evolved in this era, as numerous writers—from populist entertainers to respected poets—tried their hands at mystery stories.\"[17]\\nJohn Dickson Carr—who also wrote as Carter Dickson—used the “puzzle” approach in his writing which was characterized by including a complex puzzle for the reader to try to unravel. He created ingenious and seemingly impossible plots and is regarded as the master of the \"locked room mystery\". Two of Carr\\'s most famous works are The Case of Constant Suicides (1941) and The Hollow Man (1935).[40] Another author, Cecil Street—who also wrote as John Rhode—wrote of a detective, Dr. Priestley, who specialised in elaborate technical devices. In the United States, the whodunit subgenre was adopted and extended by Rex Stout and Ellery Queen, along with others. The emphasis on formal rules during the Golden Age produced great works, albeit with highly standardized form. The most successful novels of this time included “an original and exciting plot; distinction in the writing, a vivid sense of place, a memorable and compelling hero and the ability to draw the reader into their comforting and highly individual world.”[38]\\nA whodunit or whodunnit (a colloquial elision of \"Who [has] done it?\" or \"Who did it?\") is a complex, plot-driven variety of the detective story in which the audience is given the opportunity to engage in the same process of deduction as the protagonist throughout the investigation of a crime. The reader or viewer is provided with the clues from which the identity of the perpetrator may be deduced before the story provides the revelation itself at its climax. The \"whodunit\" flourished during the so-called \"Golden Age\" of detective fiction, between 1920 and 1950, when it was the predominant mode of crime writing.\\nAgatha Christie is not only the most famous Golden Age writer, but also considered one of the most famous authors of all genres of all time. At the time of her death in 1976, “she was the best-selling novelist in history.”[39]\\nMany of the most popular books of the Golden Age were written by Agatha Christie. She produced long series of books featuring detective characters like Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, amongst others. Her use of basing her stories on complex puzzles, “combined with her stereotyped characters and picturesque middle-class settings”, is credited for her success.[39] Christie\\'s works include Murder on the Orient Express (1934), Death on the Nile (1937), Three Blind Mice (1950) and And Then There Were None (1939).\\nThrough China\\'s Golden Age of crime fiction (1900–1949), translations of Western classics, and native Chinese detective fictions[41] circulated within the country.\\nCheng Xiaoqing had first encountered Conan Doyle\\'s highly popular stories as an adolescent. In the ensuing years, he played a major role in rendering them first into classical and later into vernacular Chinese. Cheng Xiaoqing\\'s translated works from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle introduced China to a new type of narrative style. Western detective fiction that was translated often emphasized “individuality, equality, and the importance of knowledge”,[42] appealing to China that it was the time for opening their eyes to the rest of the world.\\nThis style began China\\'s interest in popular crime fiction, and is what drove Cheng Xiaoqing to write his own crime fiction novel, Sherlock in Shanghai.[43] In the late 1910s, Cheng began writing detective fiction very much in Conan Doyle\\'s style, with Bao as the Watson-like narrator; a rare instance of such a direct appropriation from foreign fiction.[43] Famed as the “Oriental Sherlock Holmes”,[41] the duo Huo Sang and Bao Lang become counterparts to Doyle\\'s Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson characters.\\n\"Sadiq Mamquli, The Sherlock Holmes of Iran, The Sherriff of Isfahan\" is the first major detective fiction in Persian, written by Kazim Musta\\'an al-Sultan (Houshi Daryan). It was first published in 1925. There was no biographical account of the author of the book for over 70 years until being identified after the book was reprinted in 2017.[44]\\nEdogawa Rampo is the first major Japanese modern mystery writer and the founder of the Detective Story Club in Japan.[45] Rampo was an admirer of western mystery writers. He gained his fame in the early 1920s, when he began to bring to the genre many bizarre, erotic and even fantastic elements. This is partly because of the social tension before World War II.[46] In 1957, Seicho Matsumoto received the Mystery Writers of Japan Award for his short story The Face (顔 kao). The Face and Matsumoto\\'s subsequent works began the \"social school\" (社会派 shakai ha) within the genre, which emphasized social realism, described crimes in an ordinary setting and sets motives within a wider context of social injustice and political corruption.[46] Since the 1980s, a \"new orthodox school\" (新本格派 shin honkaku ha) has surfaced. It demands restoration of the classic rules of detective fiction and the use of more self-reflective elements. Famous authors of this movement include Soji Shimada, Yukito Ayatsuji, Rintaro Norizuki, Alice Arisugawa, Kaoru Kitamura and Taku Ashibe.\\nKottayam Pushpanath, a prolific writer,[47] brought to life a vivid array of characters and mysteries. Pushpanath practiced teaching history for several years before becoming a full time writer.[47] It was in the last 1960s that he made his literary debut with Chuvanna Manushyan.[48] Pushpanath authored more than 350 detective novels.[49]\\nIbn-e-Safi is the most popular Urdo detective fiction writer.[50] He started writing his famous Jasoosi Dunya Series spy stories in 1952 with Col. Fareedi & Captain. Hameed as main characters.\\nIn 1955 he started writing Imran Series spy novels with Ali Imran as X2 the chief of secret service and his companions.\\nAfter his death many other writers accepted Ali Imran character and wrote spy novels.\\nAnother popular spy novel writer was Ishtiaq Ahmad who wrote Inspector Jamsheed, Inspector Kamran Mirza and Shooki brother\\'s series of spy novels.\\nStories about robbers and detectives were very popular in Russia since old times. The most famous hero in XVIII cent. was Ivan Osipov (1718–after 1756), nicknamed Ivan Kain. Another examples of early Russian detective stories are: \"Bitter Fate\" (1789) by M. D. Chulkov (1743–1792),[51] \"The Finger Ring\" (1831) by Yevgeny Baratynsky, \"The White Ghost\" (1834) by Mikhail Zagoskin, Crime and Punishment  (1866) and The Brothers Karamazov (1880) by Fyodor Dostoevsky.[52] Detective fiction in modern Russian literature with clear detective plots started with The Garin Death Ray (1926–1927) and The Black Gold (1931) by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, Mess-Mend by Marietta Shaginyan, The Investigator\\'s Notes by Lev Sheinin.[53] Boris Akunin is a famous Russian writer of historical detective fiction in modern-day Russia.\\nEspecially in the United States, detective fiction emerged in the 1960s, and gained prominence in later decades, as a way for authors to bring stories about various subcultures to mainstream audiences. One scholar wrote about the detective novels of Tony Hillerman, set among the Native American population around New Mexico, \"many American readers have probably gotten more insight into traditional Navajo culture from his detective stories than from any other recent books.\"[54] Other notable writers who have explored regional and ethnic communities in their detective novels are Harry Kemelman, whose Rabbi Small series were set in the Conservative Jewish community of Massachusetts; Walter Mosley, whose Easy Rawlins books are set in the African American community of 1950s Los Angeles; and Sara Paretsky, whose V. I. Warshawski books have explored the various subcultures of Chicago.\\nMartin Hewitt, created by British author Arthur Morrison in 1894, is one of the first examples of the modern style of fictional private detective. This character is described as an \"\\'Everyman\\' detective meant to challenge the detective-as-superman that Holmes represented.\"[55]\\nBy the late 1920s, Al Capone and the Mob were inspiring not only fear, but piquing mainstream curiosity about the American crime underworld. Popular pulp fiction magazines like Black Mask capitalized on this, as authors such as Carrol John Daly published violent stories that focused on the mayhem and injustice surrounding the criminals, not the circumstances behind the crime. Very often, no actual mystery even existed: the books simply revolved around justice being served to those who deserved harsh treatment, which was described in explicit detail.\"[17] The overall theme these writers portrayed reflected \"the changing face of America itself.\"[55]\\nIn the 1930s, the private eye genre was adopted wholeheartedly by American writers. One of the primary contributors to this style was Dashiell Hammett with his famous private investigator character, Sam Spade.[56] His style of crime fiction came to be known as \"hardboiled\", which is described as a genre that \"usually deals with criminal activity in a modern urban environment, a world of disconnected signs and anonymous strangers.\"[56] \"Told in stark and sometimes elegant language through the unemotional eyes of new hero-detectives, these stories were an American phenomenon.\"[17]\\nIn the late 1930s, Raymond Chandler updated the form with his private detective Philip Marlowe, who brought a more intimate voice to the detective than the more distanced \"operative\\'s report\" style of Hammett\\'s Continental Op stories.[57] Despite struggling through the task of plotting a story, his cadenced dialogue and cryptic narrations were musical, evoking the dark alleys and tough thugs, rich women and powerful men about whom he wrote. Several feature and television movies have been made about the Philip Marlowe character. James Hadley Chase wrote a few novels with private eyes as the main heroes, including Blonde\\'s Requiem (1945), Lay Her Among the Lilies (1950), and Figure It Out for Yourself (1950). The heroes of these novels are typical private eyes, very similar to or plagiarizing Raymond Chandler\\'s work.[58]\\nRoss Macdonald, pseudonym of Kenneth Millar, updated the form again with his detective Lew Archer. Archer, like Hammett\\'s fictional heroes, was a camera eye, with hardly any known past. \"Turn Archer sideways, and he disappears,\" one reviewer wrote. Two of Macdonald\\'s strengths were his use of psychology and his beautiful prose, which was full of imagery. Like other \\'hardboiled\\' writers, Macdonald aimed to give an impression of realism in his work through violence, sex and confrontation. The 1966 movie Harper starring Paul Newman was based on the first Lew Archer story The Moving Target (1949). Newman reprised the role in The Drowning Pool in 1976.\\nMichael Collins, pseudonym of Dennis Lynds, is generally considered the author who led the form into the Modern Age. His PI, Dan Fortune, was consistently involved in the same sort of David-and-Goliath stories that Hammett, Chandler, and Macdonald wrote, but Collins took a sociological bent, exploring the meaning of his characters\\' places in society and the impact society had on people. Full of commentary and clipped prose, his books were more intimate than those of his predecessors, dramatizing that crime can happen in one\\'s own living room.\\nThe PI novel was a male-dominated field in which female authors seldom found publication until Marcia Muller, Sara Paretsky, and Sue Grafton were finally published in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Each author\\'s detective, also female, was brainy and physical and could hold her own.[59] Their acceptance, and success, caused publishers to seek out other female authors.\\nAn inverted detective story, also known as a \"howcatchem\", is a murder mystery fiction structure in which the commission of the crime is shown or described at the beginning,[60] usually including the identity of the perpetrator.[61] The story then describes the detective\\'s attempt to solve the mystery. There may also be subsidiary puzzles, such as why the crime was committed, and they are explained or resolved during the story. This format is the opposite of the more typical \"whodunit\", where all of the details of the perpetrator of the crime are not revealed until the story\\'s climax.\\nMany detective stories have police officers as the main characters. These stories may take a variety of forms, but many authors try to realistically depict the routine activities of a group of police officers who are frequently working on more than one case simultaneously. Some of these stories are whodunits; in others, the criminal is well known, and it is a case of getting enough evidence.\\nIn the 1940s the police procedural evolved as a new style of detective fiction. Unlike the heroes of Christie, Chandler, and Spillane, the police detective was subject to error and was constrained by rules and regulations. As Gary Huasladen says in Places for Dead Bodies, \"not all the clients were insatiable bombshells, and invariably there was life outside the job.\" The detective in the police procedural does the things police officers do to catch a criminal. Writers include Ed McBain, P. D. James, and Bartholomew Gill.[60]\\nHistorical mystery is set in a time period considered historical from the author\\'s perspective, and the central plot involves the solving of a mystery or crime (usually murder). Though works combining these genres have existed since at least the early 20th century, many credit Ellis Peters\\'s Cadfael Chronicles (1977–1994) for popularizing what would become known as the historical mystery.[62][63]\\nA variation on this is Josephine Tey\\'s The Daughter of Time. In it, Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant—who considers himself a good judge of faces—is surprised to find that what he considers to be the portrait of a sensitive man is in reality a portrait of Richard III, who murdered his brother\\'s children in order to become king. The story details his attempt to get to the historical truth of whether Richard III is the villain he has been made out to be by history. The novel was awarded the top spot in the Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time by the UK Crime Writers\\' Association[64] and the number 4 spot in The Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time Mystery Writers of America[65]\\nCozy mystery began in the late 20th century as a reinvention of the Golden Age whodunit; these novels generally shy away from violence and suspense and frequently feature female amateur detectives. Modern cozy mysteries are frequently, though not necessarily in either case, humorous and thematic (culinary mystery, animal mystery, quilting mystery, etc.)\\nThis style features minimal violence, sex, and social relevance; a solution achieved by intellect or intuition rather than police procedure, with order restored in the end; honorable and well bred characters; and a setting in a closed community. Writers include Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Elizabeth Daly.[60]\\nSerial killer mystery might be thought of as an outcropping of the police procedural. There are early mystery novels in which a police force attempts to contend with the type of criminal known in the 1920s as a homicidal maniac, such as a few of the early novels of Philip Macdonald and Ellery Queen\\'s Cat of Many Tails. However, this sort of story became much more popular after the coining of the phrase \"serial killer\" in the 1970s and the publication of The Silence of the Lambs in 1988. These stories frequently show the activities of many members of a police force or government agency in their efforts to apprehend a killer who is selecting victims on some obscure basis. They are also often much more violent and suspenseful than other mysteries.\\nThe legal thriller or courtroom novel is also related to detective fiction. The system of justice itself is always a major part of these works, at times almost functioning as one of the characters.[citation needed] In this way, the legal system provides the framework for the legal thriller as much as the system of modern police work does for the police procedural.  The legal thriller usually starts its business with the court proceedings following the closure of an investigation, often resulting in a new angle on the investigation, so as to bring about a final outcome different from the one originally devised by the investigators. In the legal thriller, court proceedings play a very active, if not to say decisive part in a case reaching its ultimate solution. Erle Stanley Gardner popularized the courtroom novel in the 20th century with his Perry Mason series. Contemporary authors of legal thrillers include Michael Connelly, Linda Fairstein, John Grisham, John Lescroart, Paul Levine, Lisa Scottoline, and Scott Turow.\\nThe locked room mystery is a subgenre of detective fiction in which a crime—almost always murder—is committed under circumstances which it was seemingly impossible for the perpetrator to commit the crime and/or evade detection in the course of getting in and out of the crime scene. The genre was established in the 19th century. Edgar Allan Poe\\'s \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841) is considered the first locked-room mystery; since then, other authors have used the scheme. The crime in question typically involves a crime scene with no indication as to how the intruder could have entered or left, i.e., a locked room. Following other conventions of classic detective fiction, the reader is normally presented with the puzzle and all of the clues, and is encouraged to solve the mystery before the solution is revealed in a dramatic climax.\\nOccult detective fiction is a subgenre of detective fiction that combines the tropes of detective fiction with those of supernatural horror fiction.  Unlike the traditional detective, the occult detective is employed in cases involving ghosts, demons, curses, magic, monsters and other supernatural elements. Some occult detectives are portrayed as knowing magic or being themselves psychic or in possession of other paranormal powers.\\nEven if they do not mean to, advertisers, reviewers, scholars and aficionados sometimes give away details or parts of the plot, and sometimes—for example in the case of Mickey Spillane\\'s novel I, the Jury—even the solution. After the credits of Billy Wilder\\'s film Witness for the Prosecution, the cinemagoers are asked not to talk to anyone about the plot so that future viewers will also be able to fully enjoy the unravelling of the mystery.\\nFor series involving amateur detectives, their frequent encounters with crime often test the limits of plausibility. The character Miss Marple, for instance, dealt with an estimated two murders a year[citation needed]; De Andrea has described Marple\\'s home town, the quiet little village of St. Mary Mead, as having \"put on a pageant of human depravity rivaled only by that of Sodom and Gomorrah\"[citation needed]. Similarly, TV heroine Jessica Fletcher of Murder, She Wrote was confronted with bodies wherever she went, but most notably in her small hometown of Cabot Cove, Maine; The New York Times estimated that, by the end of the series\\' 12-year run, nearly 2% of the town\\'s residents had been killed.[66] It is arguably more convincing if police, forensic experts or similar professionals are made the protagonist of a series of crime novels.\\nThe television series Monk has often made fun of this implausible frequency. The main character, Adrian Monk, is frequently accused of being a \"bad luck charm\" and a \"murder magnet\" as the result of the frequency with which murder happens in his vicinity.[67]\\nLikewise Kogoro Mori of the manga series Detective Conan got that kind of unflattering reputation. Although Mori is actually a private investigator with his own agency, the police never intentionally consult him as he stumbles from one crime scene to another.\\nThe role and legitimacy of coincidence has frequently been the topic of heated arguments ever since Ronald A. Knox categorically stated that \"no accident must ever help the detective\" (Commandment No. 6 in his \"Decalogue\").[68]\\nTechnological progress has also rendered many plots implausible and antiquated. For example, the predominance of mobile phones, pagers, and PDAs has significantly altered the previously dangerous situations in which investigators traditionally might have found themselves.[69]\\nOne tactic that avoids the issue of technology altogether is the historical detective genre. As global interconnectedness makes legitimate suspense more difficult to achieve, several writers—including Elizabeth Peters, P. C. Doherty, Steven Saylor, and Lindsey Davis—have eschewed fabricating convoluted plots in order to manufacture tension, instead opting to set their characters in some former period. Such a strategy forces the protagonist to rely on more inventive means of investigation, lacking as they do the technological tools available to modern detectives.\\nConversely, some detective fiction embraces networked computer technology and deals in cybercrime, like the Daemon novel series by Daniel Suarez.\\nSeveral authors have attempted to set forth a sort of list of “Detective Commandments” for prospective authors of the genre.\\nAccording to \"Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories,\" by Van Dine in 1928: \"The detective story is a kind of intellectual game. It is more—it is a sporting event. And for the writing of detective stories there are very definite laws—unwritten, perhaps, but nonetheless binding; and every respectable and self-respecting concocter of literary mysteries lives up to them. Herewith, then, is a sort of credo, based partly on the practice of all the great writers of detective stories, and partly on the promptings of the honest author\\'s inner conscience.\"[70] Ronald Knox wrote a set of Ten Commandments or Decalogue in 1929,[68] see article on the Golden Age of Detective Fiction.\\nA general consensus among crime fiction authors is there is a specific set of rules that must be applied for a novel to truly be considered part of the detective fiction genre. As noted in \"Introduction to the Analysis of Crime Fiction\",[71] crime fiction from the past 100 years has generally contained the following key rules to be a detective novel:\\nSherlock Holmes is the British fictional detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. After first appearing in A Study in Scarlet, the Sherlock Holmes stories were not an immediate success. However, after being published in the Strand Magazine in 1891, the detective became unquestionably popular.[72] Following the success of Sherlock Holmes, many mystery writers imitated Doyle\\'s structure in their own detective stories and copied Sherlock Holmes\\'s characteristics in their own detectives.\\nSherlock Holmes as a series is perhaps the most popular form of detective fiction. Doyle attempted to kill the character off after twenty-three stories, but after popular request, he continued to pen the Holmes tales. The popularity of Sherlock Holmes extends beyond the written medium.[73] For example, the BBC-produced TV series Sherlock gained a very large following after first airing in 2010, imbuing a renewed interest in the character in the general public. Because of the popularity of Holmes, Conan Doyle was often regarded as being “as well-known as Queen Victoria”.[72]\\nHercule Poirot is a fictional Belgian private detective, created by Agatha Christie. As one of Christie\\'s most famous and long-lived characters, Poirot appeared in 33 novels, one play (Black Coffee), and more than 50 short stories, published between 1920 and 1975. Hercule Poirot first appeared in The Mysterious Affair at Styles, published in 1920, and died in Curtain, published in 1975, which is Agatha Christie\\'s last work. On August 6, 1975, The New York Times published the obituary of Poirot\\'s death with the cover of the newly published novel on their front page.[74][75]\\nLe Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin is a fictional character created by Edgar Allan Poe. Dupin made his first appearance in Poe\\'s \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841), widely considered the first detective fiction story. He reappears in \"The Mystery of Marie Rogêt\" (1842) and \"The Purloined Letter\" (1844).\\nC. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the prototype for many fictional detectives that were created later, including Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle and Hercule Poirot by Agatha Christie. Conan Doyle once wrote, \"Each [of Poe\\'s detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\"\\nEllery Queen is a fictional detective created by American writers Manfred Bennington Lee and Frederic Dannay, as well as the joint pseudonym for the cousins Dannay and Lee. He first appeared in The Roman Hat Mystery  (1929), and starred in more than 30 novels and several short story collections. During the 1930s and much of the 1940s, Ellery Queen was possibly the best known American fictional detective.[76]\\nMany detectives appear in more than one novel or story. Here is a list of a few debut stories and final appearances.\\n',\n",

With this inspiration, she began writing her own stories as a child.[2] Feeling that a career as a published writer was out of reach, however, she decided to major in accounting when she attended college so that she could help her husband, Sidney D.

Her subsequent single-title works have alternated between contemporary and historical romances.[3]  Many of her novels feature a character with a disability, be it physical or mental, and show the reader how those disabilities can be overcome.  Animals are also a recurrent theme in her stories, with many books set on or near ranches.[2] Romantic Times Magazine describes her novels as \"moving, heartwarming,...celebrat[ing] the ideals of perfect love in an imperfect world.

Their estate, heavily guarded by electronic surveillance, is off limits to hunters, providing all wild creatures sanctuary.  Their three dogs are allowed to run at large on the property.[2]\\nIn May 2008, Anderson\\'s Comanche Moon was reissued and placed on the  New York Times bestseller list.\\nHer later novels, including Sun Kissed and Morning Light have reached the top 5 and 10 of the New York Times Bestseller List.[3]  She has been nominated nine times for Romantic Times Reviewers\\' Choice Awards, her book Cherish was a Romantic Times award winner, and she has also been awarded one of their Career Achievement Awards.[5]\\n',\n",

       " '\\nJane Austen (/ˈɒstɪn, ˈɔːstɪn/ OST-in, AW-stin; 16 December 1775\\xa0– 18 July 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six novels, which implicitly interpret, critique, and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen\\'s plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage for the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works are an implicit critique of the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism.[2][b] Her deft use of social commentary, realism and biting irony have earned her acclaim among critics and scholars.\\nThe anonymously published Sense and Sensibility (1811),  Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814), and Emma (1816), were a modest success but brought her little fame in her lifetime. She wrote two other novels—Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818—and began another, eventually titled Sanditon, but died before its completion. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript, the short epistolary novel Lady Susan, and the unfinished novel The Watsons.\\nSince her death Austen\\'s novels have rarely been out of print. A significant transition in her reputation occurred in 1833, when they were republished in Richard Bentley\\'s Standard Novels series (illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering and sold as a set). They gradually gained wide acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew\\'s publication of A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience. \\nHer work has inspired a large number of critical essays and has been included in many literary anthologies. Her novels have also inspired many films, including 1940\\'s Pride and Prejudice, 1995\\'s Sense and Sensibility and  2016\\'s Love & Friendship.\\nThe scant biographical information about Austen comes from her few surviving letters and sketches her family members wrote about her.[4] Only about 160 of the approximately 3,000 letters Austen wrote have survived and been published. Cassandra Austen destroyed the bulk of the letters she received from her sister, burning or otherwise destroying them. She  wanted to ensure that the \"younger nieces did not read any of Jane\\'s sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbours or family members\".[5] In the interest of protecting reputations from Jane\\'s penchant for honesty and forthrightness, Cassandra omitted details of illnesses, unhappiness and anything she considered unsavoury.[6] Important details about the Austen family were elided by intention, such as any mention of Austen\\'s brother George, whose undiagnosed developmental challenges led the family to send him away from home; the two brothers sent away to the navy at an early age; or wealthy Aunt Leigh-Perrot, arrested and tried on charges of larceny.[7]\\nThe first Austen biography was Henry Thomas Austen\\'s 1818 \"Biographical Notice\". It appeared in a posthumous edition of Northanger Abbey and included extracts from two letters, against the judgement of other family members. Details of Austen\\'s life continued to be omitted or embellished in her nephew\\'s A Memoir of Jane Austen, published in 1869, and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh\\'s biography Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters, published in 1913, all of which included additional letters.[8] Austen\\'s family and relatives built a legend of \"good quiet Aunt Jane\", portraying her as a woman in a happy domestic situation, whose family was the mainstay of her life. Modern biographers include details excised from the letters and family biographies, but the biographer Jan Fergus writes that the challenge is to keep the view balanced, not to present her languishing in periods of deep unhappiness as \"an embittered, disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family\".[4]\\nJane Austen was born in Steventon, Hampshire, on 16 December 1775 in a harsh winter.  Her father wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother \"certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago\". He added that the newborn infant was \"a present plaything for Cassy and a future companion\".[9] The winter of 1776 was particularly harsh and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church with the single name Jane.[9]\\nGeorge Austen (1731–1805), served as the rector of the Anglican parishes of Steventon and Deane.[11][c] The Reverend Austen came from an old and wealthy family of wool merchants. As each generation of eldest sons received inheritances, the wealth was divided, and George\\'s branch of the family fell into poverty. He and his two sisters were orphaned as children, and had to be taken in by relatives. In 1745, at the age of fifteen, George Austen\\'s sister Philadelphia was apprenticed to a milliner in Covent Garden.[13] At the age of sixteen, George entered St John\\'s College, Oxford,[14] where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh (1739–1827).[15] She came from the prominent Leigh family; her father was rector at All Souls College, Oxford, where she grew up among the gentry. Her eldest brother James inherited a fortune and large estate from his great-aunt Perrot, with the only condition that he change his name to Leigh-Perrot.[16]\\nGeorge Austen and Cassandra Leigh were engaged, probably around 1763, when they exchanged miniatures.[17] He received the living of the Steventon parish from the wealthy husband of his second cousin, Thomas Knight.[18] They married on 26 April 1764 at St Swithin\\'s Church in Bath, by license, in a simple ceremony, two months after Cassandra\\'s father died.[19] Their income was modest, with George\\'s small per annum living; Cassandra brought to the marriage the expectation of a small inheritance at the time of her mother\\'s death.[20]\\nThe Austens took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th-century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767.[21] Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then place it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.[22]\\nIn 1768, the family finally took up residence in Steventon. Henry was the first child to be born there, in 1771.[23] At about this time, Cassandra could no longer ignore the signs that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been deaf and mute, and she chose to send him out to be fostered.[24] In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and Jane in 1775.[25]\\nAccording to Professor of Literature Park Honan, the atmosphere of the Austen home was an \"open, amused, easy intellectual\" one, where the ideas of those with whom the Austens might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed.[26]\\nThe family relied on the patronage of their kin and hosted visits from numerous family members.[27] Mrs Austen spent the summer of 1770 in London with George\\'s sister, Philadelphia, and her daughter Eliza, accompanied by his other sister, Mrs Walter and her daughter Philly.[28][d] Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were, according to Le Faye, \"the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire, and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life, together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times, all helped to widen Jane\\'s youthful horizon and influence her later life and works.\"[29]\\nCassandra Austen\\'s cousin Thomas Leigh visited a number of times in the 1770s and 1780s, inviting young Cassie to visit them in Bath in 1781. The first mention of Jane occurs in family documents upon her return,  \"...\\xa0and almost home they were when they met Jane & Charles, the two little ones of the family, who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise, & have the pleasure of riding home in it.\"[30] Le Faye writes that \"Mr Austen\\'s predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family, there seems to have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other.\"[31]\\nFrom 1773 until 1796, George Austen supplemented his income by farming and by teaching three or four boys at a time, who boarded at his home.[32] The Reverend Austen had an annual income of £200 (equivalent to £27,000 in 2021) from his two livings.[33] This was a very modest income at the time; by comparison, a skilled worker like a blacksmith or a carpenter could make about £100 annually while the typical annual income of a gentry family was between £1,000 and £5,000.[33] Mr. Austen also rented the 200-acre Cheesedown farm from his benefactor Thomas Knight which could make a profit of £300 (equivalent to £41,000 in 2021) a year.[34]\\nDuring this period of her life, Jane Austen attended church regularly, socialised with friends and neighbours,[e] and read novels—often of her own composition—aloud to her family in the evenings. Socialising with the neighbours often meant dancing, either impromptu in someone\\'s home after supper or at the balls held regularly at the assembly rooms in the town hall.[35] Her brother Henry later said that \"Jane was fond of dancing, and excelled in it\".[36]\\nIn 1783, Austen and her sister Cassandra were sent to Oxford to be educated by Mrs Ann Cawley who took them to Southampton later that year. That autumn both girls were sent home after catching typhus, from which Jane Austen nearly died.[37] She was from then home educated, until she attended boarding school with her sister from early in 1785 at the Reading Abbey Girls\\' School, ruled by Mrs La Tournelle.[38] The curriculum probably included French, spelling, needlework, dancing, music and drama. The sisters returned home before December 1786 because the school fees for the two girls were too high for the Austen family.[39] After 1786, Austen \"never again lived anywhere beyond the bounds of her immediate family environment\".[40]\\nHer education came from reading, guided by her father and brothers James and Henry.[41] Irene Collins said that Austen \"used some of the same school books as the boys\".[42] Austen apparently had unfettered access both to her father\\'s library and that of a family friend, Warren Hastings. Together these collections amounted to a large and varied library.  Her father was also tolerant of Austen\\'s sometimes risqué experiments in writing, and provided both sisters with expensive paper and other materials for their writing and drawing.[43]\\nPrivate theatricals were an essential part of Austen\\'s education. From her early childhood, the family and friends staged a series of plays in the rectory barn, including Richard Sheridan\\'s The Rivals (1775) and David Garrick\\'s Bon Ton. Austen\\'s eldest brother James wrote the prologues and epilogues and she probably joined in these activities, first as a spectator and later as a participant.[44] Most of the plays were comedies, which suggests how Austen\\'s satirical gifts were cultivated.[45] At the age of 12, she tried her own hand at dramatic writing; she wrote three short plays during her teenage years.[46]\\nFrom at least the time she was aged eleven, Austen wrote poems and stories to amuse herself and her family.[47] She exaggerated mundane details of daily life and parodied common plot devices in \"stories [] full of anarchic fantasies of female power, licence, illicit behaviour, and general high spirits\", according to Janet Todd.[48] Containing work written between 1787 and 1793, Austen compiled fair copies of twenty-nine early works into three bound notebooks, now referred to as the Juvenilia.[49] She called the three notebooks \"Volume the First\", \"Volume the Second\" and \"Volume the Third\", and they preserve 90,000 words she wrote during those years.[50] The Juvenilia are often, according to scholar Richard Jenkyns, \"boisterous\" and \"anarchic\"; he compares them to the work of 18th-century novelist Laurence Sterne.[51]\\nAmong these works is a satirical novel in letters titled Love and Freindship  [sic], written when aged fourteen in 1790,[52] in which she mocked popular novels of sensibility.[53] The next year, she wrote The History of England, a manuscript of thirty-four pages accompanied by thirteen watercolour miniatures by her sister, Cassandra. Austen\\'s History parodied popular historical writing, particularly Oliver Goldsmith\\'s History of England (1764).[54] Honan speculates that not long after writing Love and Freindship, Austen decided to \"write for profit, to make stories her central effort\", that is, to become a professional writer. When she was around eighteen years old, Austen began to write longer, more sophisticated works.[55]\\nIn August 1792, aged seventeen, Austen started Catharine or the Bower, which presaged her mature work, especially Northanger Abbey, but was left unfinished until picked up in Lady Susan, which Todd describes as less prefiguring than Catharine.[56] A year later she began, but abandoned, a short play, later titled Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts, which she returned to and completed around 1800. This was a short parody of various school textbook abridgements of Austen\\'s favourite contemporary novel, The History of Sir Charles Grandison (1753), by Samuel Richardson.[57]\\nWhen Austen became an aunt for the first time aged eighteen, she sent new-born niece Fanny-Catherine Austen-Knight \"five short pieces of ... the Juvenilia now known collectively as \\'Scraps\\' .., purporting to be her \\'Opinions and Admonitions on the conduct of Young Women\\'\". For Jane-Anna-Elizabeth Austen (also born in 1793), her aunt wrote \"two more \\'Miscellanious [sic] Morsels\\', dedicating them to [Anna] on 2 June 1793, \\'convinced that if you seriously attend to them, You will derive from them very important Instructions, with regard to your Conduct in Life.\\'\"[58] There is manuscript evidence that Austen continued to work on these pieces as late as 1811 (when she was 36), and that her niece and nephew, Anna and James Edward Austen, made further additions as late as 1814.[59]\\nBetween 1793 and 1795 (aged eighteen to twenty), Austen wrote Lady Susan, a short epistolary novel, usually described as her most ambitious and sophisticated early work.[60] It is unlike any of Austen\\'s other works. Austen biographer Claire Tomalin describes the novella\\'s heroine as a sexual predator who uses her intelligence and charm to manipulate, betray and abuse her lovers, friends and family. Tomalin writes:\\nTold in letters, it is as neatly plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of the most outrageous of the Restoration dramatists who may have provided some of her inspiration\\xa0... It stands alone in Austen\\'s work as a study of an adult woman whose intelligence and force of character are greater than those of anyone she encounters.[61]According to Janet Todd, the model for the title character may have been Eliza de Feuillide, who inspired Austen with stories of her glamorous life and various adventures. Eliza\\'s French husband was guillotined in 1794; she married Jane\\'s brother Henry Austen in 1797.[27]\\nWhen Austen was twenty, Tom Lefroy, a neighbour, visited Steventon from December 1795 to January 1796. He had just finished a university degree and was moving to London for training as a barrister. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, and it is clear from Austen\\'s letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: \"I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together.\"[63]\\nAusten wrote in her first surviving letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was a \"very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man\".[64] Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote that she expected an \"offer\" from her \"friend\" and that \"I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat\", going on to write \"I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don\\'t give a sixpence\" and refuse all others.[64] The next day, Austen wrote: \"The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea\".[64]\\nHalperin cautioned that Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, and some of the statements about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him.[64] The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again.[65] In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen\\'s mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.[66]\\nAfter finishing Lady Susan, Austen began her first full-length novel Elinor and Marianne. Her sister remembered that it was read to the family \"before 1796\" and was told through a series of letters. Without surviving original manuscripts, there is no way to know how much of the original draft survived in the novel published anonymously in 1811 as Sense and Sensibility.[67]\\nAusten began a second novel, First Impressions (later published as Pride and Prejudice), in 1796. She completed the initial draft in August 1797, aged 21; as with all of her novels, Austen read the work aloud to her family as she was working on it and it became an \"established favourite\".[68] At this time, her father made the first attempt to publish one of her novels. In November 1797, George Austen wrote to Thomas Cadell, an established publisher in London, to ask if he would consider publishing First Impressions. Cadell returned Mr. Austen\\'s letter, marking it \"Declined by Return of Post\". Austen may not have known of her father\\'s efforts.[69] Following the completion of First Impressions, Austen returned to Elinor and Marianne and from November 1797 until mid-1798, revised it heavily; she eliminated the epistolary format in favour of third-person narration and produced something close to Sense and Sensibility.[70] In 1797, Austen met her cousin (and future sister-in-law), Eliza de Feuillide, a French aristocrat whose first husband the Comte de Feuillide had been guillotined, causing her to flee to Britain, where she married Henry Austen.[71] The description of the execution of the Comte de Feuillide related by his widow left Austen with an intense horror of the French Revolution that lasted for the rest of her life.[71]\\nDuring the middle of 1798, after finishing revisions of Elinor and Marianne, Austen began writing a third novel with the working title Susan—later Northanger Abbey—a satire on the popular Gothic novel.[72] Austen completed her work about a year later. In early 1803, Henry Austen offered Susan to Benjamin Crosby, a London publisher, who paid £10 for the copyright. Crosby promised early publication and went so far as to advertise the book publicly as being \"in the press\", but did nothing more.[73] The manuscript remained in Crosby\\'s hands, unpublished, until Austen repurchased the copyright from him in 1816.[74]\\nIn December 1800, George Austen unexpectedly announced his decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath, Somerset.[75] While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving 50 miles (80\\xa0km) away from the only home she had ever known.[76] An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived in Bath. She was able to make some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799.[77] Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.[78][f] It is often claimed that Austen was unhappy in Bath, which caused her to lose interest in writing, but it is just as possible that Austen\\'s social life in Bath prevented her from spending much time writing novels.[79] The critic Robert Irvine argued that if Austen spent more time writing novels when she was in the countryside, it might just have been because she had more spare time as opposed to being more happy in the countryside as is often argued.[79] Furthermore, Austen frequently both moved and travelled over southern England during this period, which was hardly a conducive environment for writing a long novel.[79] Austen sold the rights to publish Susan to a publisher Crosby & Company, who paid her £10 (equivalent to £860 in 2021).[80] The Crosby & Company advertised Susan, but never published it.[80]\\nThe years from 1801 to 1804 are something of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all of her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons.[82] In December 1802, Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane\\'s niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive—he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located in the area where the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance.[83] No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal.[84] Irvine described Bigg-Wither as somebody who \"...seems to have been a man very hard to like, let alone love\".[85]\\nIn 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that \"having written so much on one side of the question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection\".[86] The English scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had \"had a very high ideal of the love that should unite a husband and wife\\xa0... All of her heroines\\xa0... know in proportion to their maturity, the meaning of ardent love\".[87] A possible autobiographical element in Sense and Sensibility occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates \"the worse and most irremediable of all evils, a connection for life\" with an unsuitable man.[87][g]\\nIn 1804, while living in Bath, Austen started, but did not complete, her novel The Watsons. The story centres on an invalid and impoverished clergyman and his four unmarried daughters. Sutherland describes the novel as \"a study in the harsh economic realities of dependent women\\'s lives\".[89] Honan suggests, and Tomalin agrees, that Austen chose to stop work on the novel after her father died on 21 January 1805 and her personal circumstances resembled those of her characters too closely for her comfort.[90]\\nHer father\\'s relatively sudden death left Jane, Cassandra, and their mother in a precarious financial situation. Edward, James, Henry, and Francis Austen (known as Frank) pledged to make annual contributions to support their mother and sisters.[91] For the next four years, the family\\'s living arrangements reflected their financial insecurity. They spent part of the time in rented quarters in Bath before leaving the city in June 1805 for a family visit to Steventon and Godmersham. They moved for the autumn months to the newly fashionable seaside resort of Worthing, on the Sussex coast, where they resided at Stanford Cottage.[h] It was here that Austen is thought to have written her fair copy of Lady Susan and added its \"Conclusion\". In 1806, the family moved to Southampton, where they shared a house with Frank Austen and his new wife. A large part of this time they spent visiting various branches of the family.[92]\\nOn 5 April 1809, about three months before the family\\'s move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, offering him a new manuscript of Susan if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel, and requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time,[93] but was able to purchase it in 1816.[94]\\nAround early 1809, Austen\\'s brother Edward offered his mother and sisters a more settled life—the use of a large cottage in Chawton village[i] which was part of the estate around Edward\\'s nearby property Chawton House. Jane, Cassandra and their mother moved into Chawton cottage on 7 July 1809.[96] Life was quieter in Chawton than it had been since the family\\'s move to Bath in 1800. The Austens did not socialise with gentry and entertained only when family visited. Her niece Anna described the family\\'s life in Chawton as \"a very quiet life, according to our ideas, but they were great readers, and besides the housekeeping our aunts occupied themselves in working with the poor and in teaching some girl or boy to read or write.\"[97]\\nLike many women authors at the time, Austen published her books anonymously.[98] At the time, the ideal roles for a woman were as wife and mother, and writing for women was regarded at best as a secondary form of activity; a woman who wished to be a full-time writer was felt to be degrading her femininity, so books by women were usually published anonymously in order to maintain the conceit that the female writer was only publishing as a sort of part-time job, and was not seeking to become a \"literary lioness\" (i.e. a celebrity).[99]\\nDuring her time at Chawton, Austen published four generally well-received novels. Through her brother Henry, the publisher Thomas Egerton agreed to publish Sense and Sensibility, which, like all of Austen\\'s novels except Pride and Prejudice, was published \"on commission\", that is, at the author\\'s financial risk. When publishing on commission, publishers would advance the costs of publication, repay themselves as books were sold and then charge a 10% commission for each book sold, paying the rest to the author. If a novel did not recover its costs through sales, the author was responsible for them.[100] The alternative to selling via commission was by selling the copyright, where an author received a one-time payment from the publisher for the manuscript, which occurred with Pride and Prejudice.[101] Austen\\'s experience with Susan (the manuscript that became Northanger Abbey) where she sold the copyright to the publisher Crosby & Sons for £10, who did not publish the book, forcing her to buy back the copyright in order to get her work published, left Austen leery of this method of publishing.[98] The final alternative, of selling by subscription, where a group of people would agree to buy a book in advance, was not an option for Austen as only authors who were well known or had an influential aristocratic patron who would recommend an up-coming book to their friends, could sell by subscription.[101] Sense and Sensibility appeared in October 1811, and was described as being written \"By a Lady\".[98] As it was sold on commission, Egerton used expensive paper and set the price at 15 shillings (equivalent to £58 in 2021).[98]\\nReviews were favourable and the novel became fashionable among young aristocratic opinion-makers;[102] the edition sold out by mid-1813. Austen\\'s novels were published in larger editions than was normal for this period. The small size of the novel-reading public and the large costs associated with hand production (particularly the cost of handmade paper) meant that most novels were published in editions of 500 copies or fewer to reduce the risks to the publisher and the novelist. Even some of the most successful titles during this period were issued in editions of not more than 750 or 800 copies and later reprinted if demand continued. Austen\\'s novels were published in larger editions, ranging from about 750 copies of Sense and Sensibility to about 2,000 copies of Emma. It is not clear whether the decision to print more copies than usual of Austen\\'s novels was driven by the publishers or the author. Since all but one of Austen\\'s books were originally published \"on commission\", the risks of overproduction were largely hers (or Cassandra\\'s after her death) and publishers may have been more willing to produce larger editions than was normal practice when their own funds were at risk. Editions of popular works of non-fiction were often much larger.[103]\\nAusten made £140 (equivalent to £10,800 in 2021) from Sense and Sensibility,[104] which provided her with some financial and psychological independence.[105] After the success of Sense and Sensibility, all of Austen\\'s subsequent books were billed as written \"By the author of Sense and Sensibility\" and Austen\\'s name never appeared on her books during her lifetime.[98] Egerton then published Pride and Prejudice, a revision of First Impressions, in January 1813. Austen sold the copyright to Pride and Prejudice to Egerton for £110 (equivalent to £7,600 in 2021).[98] To maximise profits, he used cheap paper and set the price at 18 shillings (equivalent to £62 in 2021).[98] He advertised the book widely and it was an immediate success, garnering three favourable reviews and selling well. Had Austen sold Pride and Prejudice on commission, she would have made a profit of £475, or twice her father\\'s annual income.[98] By October 1813, Egerton was able to begin selling a second edition.[106] Mansfield Park was published by Egerton in May 1814. While Mansfield Park was ignored by reviewers, it was very popular with readers. All copies were sold within six months, and Austen\\'s earnings on this novel were larger than for any of her other novels.[107]\\nWithout Austen\\'s knowledge or approval, her novels were translated into French and published in cheaply produced, pirated editions in France.[108]:\\u200a1–2\\u200a The literary critic Noel King commented in 1953 that, given the prevailing rage in France at the time for lush romantic fantasies, it was remarkable that her novels with the emphasis on everyday English life had any sort of a market in France.[108]:\\u200a2\\u200a King cautioned that Austen\\'s chief translator in France, Madame Isabelle de Montolieu, had only the most rudimentary knowledge of English, and her translations were more of \"imitations\" than translations proper, as Montolieu depended upon assistants to provide a summary, which she then translated into an embellished French that often radically altered Austen\\'s plots and characters.[108]:\\u200a5–6\\u200a The first of the Austen novels to be published that credited her as the author was in France, when Persuasion was published in 1821 as La Famille Elliot ou L\\'Ancienne Inclination.[108]:\\u200a5\\u200a\\nAusten learned that the Prince Regent admired her novels and kept a set at each of his residences.[j] In November 1815, the Prince Regent\\'s librarian James Stanier Clarke invited Austen to visit the Prince\\'s London residence and hinted Austen should dedicate the forthcoming Emma to the Prince. Though Austen disapproved of the Prince Regent, she could scarcely refuse the request.[110] Austen disapproved of the Prince Regent on the account of his womanising, gambling, drinking, spendthrift ways and generally disreputable behaviour.[111] She later wrote Plan of a Novel, according to Hints from Various Quarters, a satiric outline of the \"perfect novel\" based on the librarian\\'s many suggestions for a future Austen novel.[112] Austen was greatly annoyed by Clarke\\'s often pompous literary advice, and the Plan of a Novel parodying Clarke was intended as her revenge for all of the unwanted letters she had received from the royal librarian.[111]\\nIn mid-1815 Austen moved her work from Egerton to John Murray, a better known London publisher,[k] who published Emma in December 1815 and a second edition of Mansfield Park in February 1816. Emma sold well, but the new edition of Mansfield Park did poorly, and this failure offset most of the income from Emma. These were the last of Austen\\'s novels to be published during her lifetime.[114]\\nWhile Murray prepared Emma for publication, Austen began The Elliots, later published as Persuasion. She completed her first draft in July 1816. In addition, shortly after the publication of Emma, Henry Austen repurchased the copyright for Susan from Crosby. Austen was forced to postpone publishing either of these completed novels by family financial troubles. Henry Austen\\'s bank failed in March 1816, depriving him of all of his assets, leaving him deeply in debt and costing Edward, James, and Frank Austen large sums. Henry and Frank could no longer afford the contributions they had made to support their mother and sisters.[115]\\nAusten was feeling unwell by early 1816, but ignored the warning signs. By the middle of that year, her decline was unmistakable, and she began a slow, irregular deterioration.[116] The majority of biographers rely on Zachary Cope\\'s 1964 retrospective diagnosis and list her cause of death as Addison\\'s disease, although her final illness has also been described as resulting from Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma.[117][l] When her uncle died and left his entire fortune to his wife, effectively disinheriting his relatives, she suffered a relapse, writing: \"I am ashamed to say that the shock of my Uncle\\'s Will brought on a relapse\\xa0... but a weak Body must excuse weak Nerves.\"[119]\\nAusten continued to work in spite of her illness. Dissatisfied with the ending of The Elliots, she rewrote the final two chapters, which she finished on 6 August 1816.[m] In January 1817, Austen began The Brothers (titled Sanditon when published in 1925), completing twelve chapters before stopping work in mid-March 1817, probably due to illness.[121] Todd describes Sanditon\\'s heroine, Diana Parker, as an \"energetic invalid\". In the novel Austen mocked hypochondriacs, and although she describes the heroine as \"bilious\", five days after abandoning the novel she wrote of herself that she was turning \"every wrong colour\" and living \"chiefly on the sofa\".[119] She put down her pen on 18\\xa0March 1817, making a note of it.[119]\\nAusten made light of her condition, describing it as \"bile\" and rheumatism. As her illness progressed, she experienced difficulty walking and lacked energy; by mid-April she was confined to bed. In May, Cassandra and Henry brought her to Winchester for treatment, by which time she suffered agonising pain and welcomed death.[119] Austen died in Winchester on 18\\xa0July 1817 at the age of 41. Henry, through his clerical connections, arranged for his sister to be buried in the north aisle of the nave of Winchester Cathedral. The epitaph composed by her brother James praises Austen\\'s personal qualities, expresses hope for her salvation and mentions the \"extraordinary endowments of her mind\", but does not explicitly mention her achievements as a writer.[122]\\nIn the months after Austen\\'s death in July 1817, Cassandra, Henry Austen and Murray arranged for the publication of Persuasion and Northanger Abbey as a set.[n] Henry Austen contributed a Biographical Note dated December 1817, which for the first time identified his sister as the author of the novels. Tomalin describes it as \"a loving and polished eulogy\".[124] Sales were good for a year—only 321 copies remained unsold at the end of 1818.[125]\\nAlthough Austen\\'s six novels were out of print in England in the 1820s, they were still being read through copies housed in private libraries and circulating libraries. Austen had early admirers. The first piece of fiction using her as a character (what might now be called real person fiction) appeared in 1823 in a letter to the editor in The Lady\\'s Magazine.[126] It refers to Austen\\'s genius and suggests that aspiring authors were envious of her powers.[127]\\nIn 1832, Richard Bentley purchased the remaining copyrights to all of her novels, and over the following winter published five illustrated volumes as part of his Standard Novels series. In October 1833, Bentley released the first collected edition of her works. Since then, Austen\\'s novels have been continuously in print.[128]\\nAusten\\'s works implicitly critique the sentimental novels of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism.[129][o]  The earliest English novelists, Richardson, Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett, were followed by the school of sentimentalists and romantics such as Walter Scott, Horace Walpole, Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe, and Oliver Goldsmith, whose style and genre Austen repudiated, returning the novel on a \"slender thread\" to the tradition of Richardson and Fielding for a \"realistic study of manners\".[130] In the mid-20th century, literary critics F. R. Leavis and Ian Watt placed her in the tradition of Richardson and Fielding; both believe that she used their tradition of  \"irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both\".[131]\\nWalter Scott noted Austen\\'s \"resistance to the trashy sensationalism of much of modern fiction—\\'the ephemeral productions which supply the regular demand of watering places and circulating libraries\\'\".[132] Yet her relationship with these genres is complex, as evidenced by Northanger Abbey and Emma.[132] Similar to William Wordsworth, who excoriated the modern frantic novel in the \"Preface\" to his Lyrical Ballads (1800), Austen distances herself from escapist novels; the discipline and innovation she demonstrates is similar to his, and she shows \"that rhetorically less is artistically more.\"[132] She eschewed popular Gothic fiction, stories of terror in which a heroine typically was stranded in a remote location, a castle or abbey (32 novels between 1784 and 1818 contain the word \"abbey\" in their title). Yet in Northanger Abbey she alludes to the trope, with the heroine, Catherine, anticipating a move to a remote locale. Rather than full-scale rejection or parody, Austen transforms the genre, juxtaposing reality, with descriptions of elegant rooms and modern comforts, against the heroine\\'s \"novel-fueled\" desires.[133] Nor does she completely denigrate Gothic fiction: instead she transforms settings and situations, such that the heroine is still imprisoned, yet her imprisonment is mundane and real—regulated manners and the strict rules of the ballroom.[134] In Sense and Sensibility Austen presents characters who are more complex than in staple sentimental fiction, according to critic Keymer, who notes that although it is a parody of popular sentimental fiction, \"Marianne in her sentimental histrionics responds to the calculating world\\xa0... with a quite justifiable scream of female distress.\"[135]\\nThe hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think and be miserable. It was a wretched business, indeed! Such an overthrow of everything she had been wishing for! Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!\\n— example of free indirect speech, Jane Austen,  Emma[136]\\nRichardson\\'s Pamela, the prototype for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love story with a happy ending, written at a time women were beginning to have the right to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions.[137] Austen attempted Richardson\\'s epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech—she was the first English novelist to do so extensively—through which she had the ability to present a character\\'s thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator\\'s voice and values and those of the characters.[138]\\nAusten had a natural ear for speech and dialogue, according to scholar Mary Lascelles: \"Few novelists can be more scrupulous than Jane Austen as to the phrasing and thoughts of their characters.\"[139] Techniques such as fragmentary speech suggest a character\\'s traits and their tone; \"syntax and phrasing rather than vocabulary\" is utilised to indicate social variants.[140] Dialogue reveals a character\\'s mood—frustration, anger, happiness—each treated differently and often through varying patterns of sentence structures. When Elizabeth Bennet rejects Darcy, her stilted speech and the convoluted sentence structure reveals that he has wounded her:[141]\\nFrom the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.[142]\\nAusten\\'s plots highlight women\\'s traditional dependence on marriage to secure social standing and economic security.[143] As an art form, the 18th-century novel lacked the seriousness of its equivalents from the 19th century, when novels were treated as \"the natural vehicle for discussion and ventilation of what mattered in life\".[144]  Rather than delving too deeply into the psyche of her characters, Austen enjoys them and imbues them with humour, according to critic John Bayley. He believes that the well-spring of her wit and irony is her own attitude that comedy \"is the saving grace of life\".[145] Part of Austen\\'s fame rests on the historical and literary significance that she was the first woman to write great comic novels. Samuel Johnson\\'s influence is evident, in that she follows his advice to write \"a representation of life as may excite mirth\".[146]\\nHer humour comes from her modesty and lack of superiority, allowing her most successful characters, such as Elizabeth Bennet, to transcend the trivialities of life, which the more foolish characters are overly absorbed in.[145] Austen used comedy to explore the individualism of women\\'s lives and gender relations, and she appears to have used it to find the goodness in life, often fusing it with \"ethical sensibility\", creating artistic tension. Critic Robert Polhemus writes,  \"To appreciate the drama and achievement of Austen, we need to realize how deep was her passion for both reverence and ridicule\\xa0... and her comic imagination reveals both the harmonies and the telling contradictions of her mind and vision as she tries to reconcile her satirical bias with her sense of the good.\"[146]\\nAs Austen\\'s works were published anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but were rarely reviewed.[102] Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious,[147][148] most often focused on the moral lessons of the novels.[149]\\nSir Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, anonymously wrote a review of Emma in 1815, using it to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel and praising Austen\\'s realism, \"the art of copying from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the reader, instead of the splendid scenes from an imaginary world, a correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him\".[150] The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately set the tone for almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.[151]\\nBecause Austen\\'s novels did not conform to Romantic and Victorian expectations that \"powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and colour in the writing\",[153]  19th-century critics and audiences preferred the works of Charles Dickens and George Eliot.[154] Notwithstanding Walter Scott\\'s positivity, Austen\\'s work did not match the prevailing aesthetic values of the Romantic zeitgeist.[155] Her novels were republished in Britain from the 1830s and sold steadily, but they were not best-sellers.[156]\\nThe first French critic who paid notice to Austen was Philarète Chasles in an 1842 essay, dismissing her in two sentences as a boring, imitative writer with no substance.[157] Austen was almost completely ignored in France until 1878,[157] when the French critic Léon Boucher published the essay Le Roman Classique en Angleterre, in which he called Austen a \"genius\", the first French author to do so.[158] The first accurate translation of Austen into French occurred in 1899 when Félix Fénéon translated Northanger Abbey as Catherine Moreland.[158]\\nIn Britain, Austen gradually grew in the estimation of the literati. Philosopher and literary critic George Henry Lewes published a series of enthusiastic articles in the 1840s and 1850s.[159] Later in the century, novelist Henry James referred to Austen several times with approval, and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding as among \"the fine painters of life\".[160]\\nThe publication of James Edward Austen-Leigh\\'s A Memoir of Jane Austen in 1869 introduced Austen to a wider public as \"dear aunt Jane\", the respectable maiden aunt. Publication of the Memoir spurred the reissue of Austen\\'s novels—the first popular editions were released in 1883 and fancy illustrated editions and collectors\\' sets quickly followed.[161] Author and critic Leslie Stephen described the popular mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as \"Austenolatry\". Around the start of the 20th century, an intellectual clique of Janeites reacted against the popularisation of Austen, distinguishing their deeper appreciation from the vulgar enthusiasm of the masses.\\nIn response, Henry James decried \"a beguiled infatuation\" with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen\\'s \"intrinsic merit and interest\".[162] The American literary critic A. Walton Litz noted that the \"anti-Janites\" in the 19th and 20th centuries comprised a formidable literary squad of Mark Twain, Henry James, Charlotte Brontë, D. H. Lawrence and Kingsley Amis, but in \"every case the adverse judgement merely reveals the special limitations or eccentricities of the critic, leaving Jane Austen relatively untouched\".[163]\\nAusten\\'s works have attracted legions of scholars. The first dissertation on Austen was published in 1883, by George Pellew, a student at Harvard University.[164] Another early academic analysis came from a 1911 essay by Oxford Shakespearean scholar A. C. Bradley,[165] who grouped Austen\\'s novels into \"early\" and \"late\" works, a distinction still used by scholars today.[166] The first academic book devoted to Austen in France was Jane Austen by Paul and Kate Rague (1914), who set out to explain why French critics and readers should take Austen seriously.[158] The same year, Léonie Villard published Jane Austen, Sa Vie et Ses Oeuvres, originally her PhD thesis, the first serious academic study of Austen in France.[158] In 1923, R.W. Chapman published the first scholarly edition of Austen\\'s collected works, which was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist. The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen\\'s works.[167]\\nWith the publication in 1939 of Mary Lascelles\\' Jane Austen and Her Art, the academic study of Austen took hold.[168] Lascelles analyzed the books Austen read and their influence on her work, and closely examined Austen\\'s style and \"narrative art\". Concern arose that academics were obscuring the appreciation of Austen with increasingly esoteric theories, a debate that has continued since.[169]\\nThe period since World War II has seen a diversity of critical approaches to Austen, including feminist theory, and perhaps most controversially, postcolonial theory.[170] The divide has widened between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern Janeites, and academic judgements.[171] In 1994, literary critic Harold Bloom placed Austen among the greatest Western writers of all time.[172]\\nIn the People\\'s Republic of China after 1949, writings of Austen were regarded as too frivolous,[173] and thus during the Chinese Cultural Revolution of 1966–69, Austen was banned as a \"British bourgeois imperialist\".[174] In the late 1970s, when Austen\\'s works was re-published in China, her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people generally read books for enjoyment, not political edification.[175]\\nIn a typical modern debate, the conservative American professor Gene Koppel, to the  indignation of his liberal literature students, mentioned that Austen and her family were \"Tories of the deepest dye\", i.e. Conservatives in opposition to the liberal Whigs. Although several feminist authors such as Claudia Johnson and Mollie Sandock claimed Austen for their own cause, Koppel argued that different people react to a work of literature in different subjective ways, as explained by the philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer. Thus competing interpretations of Austen\\'s work can be equally valid, provided they are grounded in textual and historical analysis: it is equally possible to see Austen as a feminist critiquing Regency-era society and as a conservative upholding its values.[176]\\nAusten\\'s novels have resulted in sequels, prequels and adaptations of almost every type, from soft-core pornography to fantasy. From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations.[177] The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi\\'s Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance, and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, The Bennets (1901).[178] The first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of Pride and Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson.[179] BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen\\'s plots, characterisations and settings.[180] The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen\\'s novels, starting with the 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice, class is subtly downplayed, and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.[181]\\nFrom 1995, many Austen adaptations appeared, with Ang Lee\\'s film of Sense and Sensibility, for which screenwriter and star Emma Thompson won an Academy Award, and the BBC\\'s immensely popular TV mini-series Pride and Prejudice, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.[182] A 2005 British production of Pride and Prejudice, directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen,[183] was followed in 2007 by ITV\\'s Mansfield Park, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion,[184] and in 2016 by Love & Friendship starring Kate Beckinsale as Lady Susan, a film version of Lady Susan, that borrowed the title of Austen\\'s Love and Freindship  [sic].[185]\\nIn 2013, Austen\\'s works featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to mark the bicentenary of the publication of Pride and Prejudice.[186] Austen is on the £10 note issued by the Bank of England which was introduced in 2017, replacing Charles Darwin.[187][188] In July 2017, a statue of Jane Austen was erected in Basingstoke, Hampshire on the 200th anniversary of her death.[189]\\nJuvenilia—Volume the First (1787–1793)[q]\\nJuvenilia—Volume the Second (1787–1793)\\nJuvenilia—Volume the Third (1787–1793)\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\nFaith Baldwin (October 1, 1893 – March 18, 1978) was an American writer of romance novels and other forms of fiction,[1] often concentrating on women characters juggling career and family. The New York Times wrote that her books had \"never a pretense at literary significance\" and were popular because they \"enabled lonely working people, young and old, to identify with her glamorous and wealthy characters\".[2]\\nFaith Baldwin was born on October 1, 1893, in New Rochelle, New York, the daughter of a well-known trial lawyer, Stephen Baldwin, and Edith Baldwin. Her cousin was screenwriter Paul Hervey Fox.[3]  After three years, her family moved to Manhattan and finally settled in Brooklyn Heights, an upper-middle-class neighborhood in New York City. In 1901, her younger sister Esther was born.  In Brooklyn Heights, Baldwin lived an upscale childhood which would influence the settings and scenarios of her later work.  She learned how to read at the age of three and wanted to become an actress, sending letters to actresses she admired and occasionally meeting them.  According to Baldwin, her parents were startled by her reading at such an early age. She noted later in life that she never intended to become a writer despite her frequent practice, as she viewed acting as a way to become independent.  Accustomed to an affluent lifestyle, Baldwin, in 1914, resided for two years in Europe, living with one of her mother\\'s close friends in Dresden, Germany. She was sent to cooking school and learned German, even though World War I was raging. She later recalled, \"Life didn\\'t change for us because of the war.\\xa0... we continued to go to the opera.\"[2] Baldwin returned to the United States in 1916, and after the U.S. entered the war, she began working for the War Camp Community Service. It was during her community service activities that she met Hugh H. Cantrell, a Navy pilot and executive of Brooklyn Union Gas Company; they were married in 1920.\\nBaldwin\\'s writing career began in earnest when her first novel, Mavis of Green Hill, was published in 1921 by Boston publisher Small, Maynard & Company. Six years later, in 1927, she sold her first serial to a magazine, Good Housekeeping. This led to more serials for \"women\\'s magazines\" that published romance novels as six-part serials, and her popularity with the middle-class and working women audience quickly grew.[1] Eventually she was able to command upwards of $55,000 for serialization rights to her novels, which appeared in publications such as Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping, and The Ladies Home Journal.[2]  In 1935, she was described as the newest of the \"highly paid\" women romance writers by Time magazine.[4] Her popularity was at its peak in the 1930s, and in 1936 she earned over $300,000 (approximately equivalent to $4 million in 2005).[5] In the 1950s, she was still going strong, with earnings over $2 million, sales over 10 million in all editions, and \"one of the handful of living novelists to complete a five-foot shelf\".[6] In total, Baldwin wrote about 85 books, including 60 novels, two books of poetry, and countless dozens of short stories and magazine articles.[2]\\nIn 1951, Baldwin hosted a weekly television anthology program on Saturday afternoons, called Faith Baldwin Romance Theatre.[7][8]\\nFrom 1958 to 1965, she wrote a column that was published in Woman\\'s Day called \"The Open Door\".[citation needed] Baldwin continued to write until her death in 1978. She was often quoted by others, and her comments are now often found in books of quotes and on web sites that offer quotes.[9] Several of her stories and novels were adapted to the big screen.[10]\\nIn the late 1960s, Baldwin\\'s name was used in a dubious advertising campaign for the Famous Writers School, a correspondence school. She was listed as a \"guiding faculty\" member, along with other \"faculty\", including Bennett Cerf, Bergen Evans, Bruce Catton, Mignon G. Eberhart, John Caples, J. D. Ratcliff, Mark Wiseman, Max Shulman, Rudolf Flesch, Red Smith, and Rod Serling.[11] The advertising drew sharp criticism and accusations as deceptive because the inattentive reader may have inferred from the ad copy that the listed famous writers personally reviewed and provided critiques of students\\' work, which was not true.[12]\\nLater in life when asked about her life philosophy, Baldwin responded that her belief was simple: \"It is in God and His spirit in mankind. It is in man and his struggle. It is in the Golden Rule and in the valor of men, however ignoble their shortcomings.\"\\nOn March 18, 1978, Baldwin died at her home in Norwalk, Connecticut, of a heart attack.[13] She was 84 years old. Baldwin is interred in Lakeview Cemetery in the town of New Canaan, Connecticut.[citation needed]\\nIn 1920, at the age of 27, Baldwin married Hugh H. Cuthrell in Brooklyn. She had four children with Cuthrell: sons Hugh Jr. and Stephen, and daughters Hervey and Ann. Hugh H. Cuthrell later became president and chairman of the board of the Brooklyn Union Gas Company. He died in 1953. Hugh Jr. died in a car accident in 1960. At her death, Baldwin was survived by her three other children as well as her sister, Esther.[2]\\nFor many years, Baldwin lived in a 14-room house in Norwalk, Connecticut, called Fabled Farm. Situated on 8+1⁄2 acres, the house, which was built in 1800, was both her home and studio.[2]\\n',\n",

She was also an oil painter, who was selected for inclusion in a national exhibition in 2004, at the age of 96.[4]\\nBorn Ida Julia Crowe on 12 April 1908 in Lewisham, Kent, England,[5] she was the daughter of Fanny Osborn, whose father was an architect in Victorian London, and her husband Arthur Crowe, but Pollock claimed to be illegitimate.[6] Still unmarried, her mother began an affair with a supposed Russian duke, but, after her parents\\' death, her mother married Arthur Crowe, an old widower with a distant connection to Lord Nelson. A year or so later her mother resumed her affair with her Russian lover and became pregnant, but her daughter obtained her husband\\'s surname.[6] Her mother lived alone when Pollock was born, and she narrowly escaped being smothered with a pillow by the nurse who attended her birth.[7] Her mother had a difficult time raising her and she was almost adopted by a rich uncle.[6] Encouraged by her mother, she began to write while still at school. At 14, she published her first thriller, The Hills of Raven\\'s Haunt.[citation needed]\\nAt age 20, she was living with her mother in Hastings and already had several stories in major magazines and short novels in print.[8] She visited George Newnes\\'s office in London, to sell her first full-length manuscript;[7] Palanquins and Coloured Lanterns, a novel set in 1920s Shanghai.[8] Six months later, she discovered they had mislaid it.[9] After they found it, she returned to London to meet one of its editors, the 39-year-old Hugh Alexander Pollock (1888–1971), a distinguished veteran of World War I. Hugh had been married since 1924 to his second wife, the popular children\\'s writer Enid Blyton, and was divorced from his first wife, Marion Atkinson, with whom he had two sons, William Cecil Alexander (1914–16) and Edward Alistair (1915–69). George Newnes bought her manuscript and contracted with her to write two more novels.[7] She became a full-time writer in the 1930s, writing short stories under pseudonyms. Ida decided to travel alone to Morocco, after suffering a mental breakdown.[7]\\nDuring World War II, Ida worked at a hostel for girls in London during the Blitz; at this time Hugh, who had left publishing to join the Army, was Commandant of a school for Home Guard officers.[10] Hugh had two daughters with Enid Blyton, Gillian Mary (later Baverstock; 1931–2007) and Imogen Mary (later Smallwood; born 1935), but his marriage had difficulties and his wife began a series of affairs. He offered Ida a post as civilian secretary at the Army Training Centre in the Surrey Hills. During a bungled firearms training session on a firing range, Hugh was hit by shrapnel and Ida contacted Enid, who declined to visit her husband because she was busy and hated hospitals.[7]\\nIn 1941, Enid met Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters, a London surgeon with whom she began another relationship, and the marriage had broken down. In May 1942, while Ida was visiting her mother\\'s home in Hastings a bomb destroyed the house. She escaped unhurt, but her mother was in hospital for two weeks.[7] Hugh paid for Ida to stay at Claridges and he said he was divorcing his wife. To get a quick divorce, Hugh blamed himself for adultery at divorce petition. On 26 October 1943 Ida and Hugh were married at London\\'s Guildhall Register Office, six days after Enid\\'s marriage to Darrell Waters. In 1944 they had a daughter Rosemary Pollock who has also become a romance writer. Enid changed the names of their daughters and Hugh did not see them again, although Enid had promised access as part of his taking the blame for the divorce.[citation needed]\\nAfter World War II, George Newnes, Hugh\\'s old firm, decided not to work with him anymore. They also represented Enid Blyton and were not willing to let her go. After this the marriage experienced financial problems and, in 1950, Hugh had to declare bankruptcy while he struggled with alcoholism. Ida decided to write popular contemporary romances and sold her first novel to Mills & Boon in 1952. Being in print with several major international publishers at the same time, she decided to use multiple pseudonyms. In the 1950s she wrote as Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Rose Burghley, and Mary Whistler to Mills & Boon; as Averil Ives and Barbara Rowan to Ward Lock; as Anita Charles to Wright & Brown; and as Jane Beaufort to Collins. In 1964, she published under her married name, Ida Pollock, her first historical novel, The Gentle Masquerade, and after the success of it, Mills and Boon\\'s \"Masquerade\" series of historical romances was launched.[8] Under her last pseudonym, Marguerite Bell, she also wrote historical romances. Most of her novels have been reprinted by Mills & Boon (or Harlequin in the United States).\\nDuring her marriage she travelled widely and lived in many parts of England. It was their daughter\\'s asthma that brought the Pollocks to Cornwall. They also lived in Ireland, France, Italy, Malta and Switzerland, where they successfully obtained a lasting cure for Rosemary\\'s debilitating condition.[7] Hugh died on 8 November 1971 in Malta, where he is buried in the British military cemetery. After her husband\\'s death, Pollock returned with her daughter to England and they lived for several years in Wiltshire, before moving to Lanreath in 1986. In the 1970s she slowed the rhythm of publication, but continued to write.

       " 'Jayne Ann Krentz, née Jayne Castle (born March 28, 1948, in Cobb, California, United States), is an American writer of romance novels. Krentz is the author of a string of New York Times bestsellers under seven different pseudonyms. Now, she only uses three names. Under her married name she writes contemporary romantic-suspense. She uses Amanda Quick for her novels of historical romantic-suspense. She uses her maiden name for futuristic/paranormal romantic-suspense writing.\\nOver 35 million copies of Krentz\\'s novels are in print. With Sweet Starfire, she created the futuristic romance subgenre, and further expanded the boundaries of the genre in 1996 with Amaryllis, the first paranormal futuristic romantic suspense novel. She is an outspoken advocate for the romance genre and has been the recipient of the Susan Koppelman Award for Feminist Studies.\\nJayne Ann Castle was born on March 28, 1948, in Cobb, California, United States.[1] She and her two brothers were raised by their mother, Alberta, in Borrego Springs for the first decade of Jayne\\'s life.\\nShe earned a B.A in History at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1970.[2] Fearful that she would be unable to find a job using her degree, she elected to obtain her graduate degree in Library Science from San Jose State University. Immediately after graduation she married Frank Krentz, an engineer, whom she had met at San Jose State. The couple moved to the Virgin Islands, where Krentz worked for a year as an elementary school librarian, a time she refers to as \"an unmitigated career disaster\".[1] Realizing that she enjoyed being a librarian but not the aspects of teaching that working in an elementary school required, Krentz moved into the higher levels of academia, including a stint in the Duke University library system.[1] Krentz and her husband later moved to Seattle, Washington.\\nKrentz has been generous in sharing her wealth with libraries. She established the Castle Humanities Fund at UCSC\\'s University Library to allow the library to purchase additional books and has given money to 15 Seattle-area elementary schools to enhance their library budgets. She is also a member of the Advisory Board for the Writers Programs at the University of Washington extension program.[2][3]\\nWhile working at Duke, Krentz began writing stories her way, combining elements of romance novels with paranormal twists. For six years she wrote and mailed proposals for new novels, consistently receiving rejection letters.[1] She claims to have tried to stop writing several times during that period, but that it became a \"compulsion\".[3] During this time she and her family moved to Seattle, Washington to further her husband\\'s aerospace career.\\nKrentz continued writing, and, in 1979, she sold her first novel, Gentle Pirate.[1] That novel and several that followed were published within various category romance lines, as that was the only method in which contemporary romance was published. As more publishers began to release single-title contemporary romances, Krentz shifted into writing only single-title novels.[4]\\nHer first novels were released under her birth name, Jayne Castle. Krentz signed a contract allowing one of her publishers to own the name, and, after leaving that publisher, Krentz was unable to use that name on new works for ten years. This led to the creation of several pseudonyms, including Jayne Taylor, Jayne Bentley, Stephanie James and Amanda Glass. By the mid-1980s she had begun using only her married name, Jayne Ann Krentz, for all of her contemporary romance novels.[1]\\nHer 1986 novel, Sweet Starfire, was a futuristic romance, a subgenre that combined elements of romance novels and science fiction. The novel was a \"classic road trip romance\" which just happened to be set in a separate galaxy. In 1987 she published a second futuristic romance, Crystal Flame, which again allowed for a \"traditional romance plot unfold[ing] in an extraordinary world\".[5]\\nThe success of these books encouraged Krentz to try to write a real historical romance with a humorous twist, which she released under the pseudonym Amanda Quick.[5]\\nShe began writing paranormal futuristic novels of romantic suspense in 1996. Released under her maiden name, Jayne Castle, these novels are set far in the future in a world where everyone has a psychic talent and respectable people use marriage agencies instead of choosing their own mates. As is customary in her writing, in each case the protagonists have a mystery to solve or a villain to defeat.[6]\\nPsychic themes appear throughout Krentz\\'s work. In 2006 she began a new series, called The Arcane Society, which includes books written as Amanda Quick (historical setting), Jayne Ann Krentz (contemporary setting), and Jayne Castle (futuristic setting).

       " '\\nMary Josephine Beverley (née Dunn; 22 September 1947 – 23 May 2016) was a prolific English-Canadian writer of historical and contemporary romance novels from 1988 to 2016.[1]\\nHer works are regarded[by whom?] as well researched, filled with historical details, and peopled by communities of interlinked characters, stretching the boundaries of the historical romantic fiction genre. They have been translated into several languages, and she has received multiple awards.\\nMary Josephine Dunn was born 22 September 1947 in Lancashire, England. She was of Irish descent.[2]\\nAt age 11, she went to an all-girls boarding school, Layton Hill Convent, Blackpool. At 16, she wrote her first romance, with a medieval setting, completed in instalments in an exercise book. She read history and American studies at Keele University in Staffordshire from 1966 to 1970[citation needed], where she earned a degree in English history.[3] The broad-based learning of Keele\\'s foundation year and the availability of archived Regency-period newspapers were useful resources to enable her to develop her fiction writing.[citation needed]\\nOn 24 June 1971, she married Ken Beverley, whom she met at Keele.[citation needed]\\nAfter graduation, she quickly attained a position as a youth employment officer. She stayed in this profession until 1976, working first in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, and then in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire.\\nIn 1976, Beverley moved to Canada, where her scientist husband was invited to do post-doctoral research at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. When her professional qualifications proved unusable in the Canadian labour market, Beverley decided to develop her early interest in creative writing.[citation needed]\\nMany of her \"Rogue\" characters were created in an initial manuscript entitled A Regency Rape. At this point, Beverley did not have a fixed idea of the narrower literary boundaries drawn by the traditional Regency romantic novel and thus created a literary hybrid. A precursor of the Regency historical novel, the work had a more varied cast of characters which, while respectful of the world of Georgette Heyer, broadened the scope and intensity of the genre. At this time Beverley was still unpublished, but devoted her time to caring for her two young sons and participating in the woman-centred childbirth movement, which made her especially careful to portray births in her novels realistically but positively.[citation needed]\\nThe turning point in Beverley\\'s writing career came when her move to Montreal led to her attendance at a talk on \"The state of romance in fiction\" by Janet Adams, at Beaconsfield Library on 23 May 1984. The executive advisor of the Writers\\' Association for Romance and Mainstream demystified the creative process for the budding author and was sufficiently impressed by Beverley\\'s writing to act as her agent.[citation needed]\\nThat same year, the family moved to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, where Beverley became a founding member of the Ottawa Romance Writers\\' Association (ORWA). Formed in 1985, ORWA became her \"nurturing community\" for the next 12 years.[citation needed]\\nIn 1988, Beverley, who was actively writing science fiction as well as romance, was a finalist in the L. Ron Hubbard Writers of the Future Contest. That same year, she sold her first romance novel. With her ensuing success in the latter genre, she allowed speculative writing to slide, though elements of it appear periodically in some of her romances and novellas.[citation needed]\\nBeverly wrote at multiple blogs:\\nSoon after university, Beverley and her husband Ken moved to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Beverley became a Canadian with dual citizenship, and she and Ken raised their two sons there, then moved to Victoria, British Columbia.[2]\\nMore recently, she and Ken moved back to England[when?], and they lived in Dawlish, Devon,[5] though they were considering returning to Victoria permanently.[2]\\nIn 2012, Beverley survived a bout with cancer and was in remission for four years. However, the cancer returned and moved very quickly; she succumbed to it on 23 May 2016. She died in a care home in Yorkshire, England.[1][2]\\nHer works have been translated into many languages and have won her many awards, including five RITAs, two Career Achievement Awards from Romantic Times, The Golden Leaf Award, and the Readers\\' Choice Award. A member of the Romance Writers of America (RWA) Honor Roll, Beverley is the sole Canadian romance author inducted into the RWA Hall of Fame.\\n[6]\\n(related to the Company of Rogues)\\n',\n",

       " '\\nAnne Maeve Binchy Snell (28 May 1939[1] – 30 July 2012) was an Irish novelist, playwright, short story writer, columnist, and speaker. Her novels were characterised by a sympathetic and often humorous portrayal of small-town life in Ireland, and surprise endings.[2][3] Her novels, which were translated into 37 languages, sold more than 40 million copies worldwide. Her death at age 73, announced by Vincent Browne on Irish television late on 30 July 2012, was mourned as the death of one of Ireland\\'s best-loved and most recognisable writers.[4][5][6][7]\\nShe appeared in the US market, featuring on The New York Times best-seller list and in Oprah\\'s Book Club.[8] Recognised for her \"total absence of malice\"[9] and generosity to other writers, she finished third in a 2000 poll for World Book Day, ahead of Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and Stephen King.[4][10]\\nAnne Maeve Binchy[1] was born on 28 May 1939[1] in Dalkey, Dublin, the oldest of the four children of William and Maureen (née Blackmore) Binchy. Her siblings include one brother, William Binchy, Regius Professor of Laws at Trinity College Dublin, and two sisters: Irene \"Renie\" (who predeceased Binchy), and Joan, Mrs Ryan.[11] Her uncle was the historian D. A. Binchy (1899–1989). Educated at St Anne\\'s (then located at No 35 Clarinda Park East), Dún Laoghaire, and later at Holy Child Killiney,[12] she went on to study at University College Dublin (where she earned a bachelor\\'s degree in history),[2][3][13] she worked as a teacher[2][14] of French, Latin, and history at various girls\\' schools,[12][13][15] then a journalist at The Irish Times,[2] and later became a writer of novels, short stories, and dramatic works.[16][17][18]\\nIn 1968, her mother died of cancer aged 57. After Binchy\\'s father died in 1971, she sold the family house and moved to a bedsit in Dublin.[19]\\nHer parents were Catholics and Binchy attended a convent school. However, a trip to Israel profoundly affected both her career and her faith.  She later said to Vulture:\\nIn 1963, I worked in a Jewish school in Dublin, teaching French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and worked in a kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was going out to the Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It\\'s not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.[16][20]One Sunday, attempting to locate where the Last Supper is supposed to have occurred, she climbed a mountainside to a cavern guarded by a Brooklyn-born Israeli soldier. She wept with despair. The soldier asked, \"What\\'ya expect, ma\\'am – a Renaissance table set for 13?\" She replied, \"Yes! That\\'s just what I did expect.\" This experience caused her to renounce her Catholic faith, and eventually become agnostic.[21]\\nBinchy, described as \"six feet tall, rather stout, and garrulous\",[15] although she actually grew to 6\\'1\",[1] said in an interview with Gay Byrne of The Late Late Show that, growing up in Dalkey, she never felt herself to be attractive; \"as a plump girl I didn\\'t start on an even footing to everyone else\".[22] After her mother\\'s death, she expected to lead a life of spinsterhood, saying \"I expected I would live at home, as I always did.\" She continued, \"I felt very lonely, the others all had a love waiting for them and I didn\\'t.\"[22]\\nHowever, when recording a piece for Woman\\'s Hour in London she met children\\'s author Gordon Snell, then a freelance producer with the BBC.[22] Their friendship blossomed into a cross-border romance, with her in Ireland and him in London, until she eventually secured a job in London through The Irish Times.[22] She and Snell married in 1977 and, after living in London for a time, moved to Ireland. They lived together in Dalkey, not far from where she had grown up, until Binchy\\'s death.[23] She said of him that he was a \"writer, a man I loved and he loved me and we got married and it was great and is still great. He believed I could do anything, just as my parents had believed all those years ago, and I started to write fiction and that took off fine. And he loved Ireland, and the fax was invented so we writers could live anywhere we liked, instead of living in London near publishers.[5]\\nFiles in Ireland\\'s National Archives, released to the public in 2006, feature a request from Maeve Binchy to President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh asking if he could \"receive\" her. She wrote, \"I know you are extremely busy but I often see in the paper that you \\'received\\' so-and-so and was wondering very simply could I be received too.\" This request came while she was working for The Irish Times in London in 1975.[24]\\nIn 2002, Binchy suffered health problems related to a heart condition, which inspired her to write Heart and Soul. The book, about what Binchy terms \"a heart failure clinic\" in Dublin and the people involved with it, reflects many of her own experiences and observations in the hospital.[16][20][25] Towards the end of her life, Binchy\\'s website stated \"My health isn\\'t so good these days and I can\\'t travel around to meet people the way I used to. But I\\'m always delighted to hear from readers, even if it takes me a while to reply.\"[4]\\nBinchy died on 30 July 2012. She was 73 and had suffered from various maladies, including painful osteoarthritis.[26] As a result of the arthritis she had a hip operation.[27] A month before her death she suffered a severe spinal infection (acute discitis),[1] and finally succumbed to a heart attack.[4][6] Gordon was by her side when she died in a Dublin hospital.[5] Just ahead of that evening\\'s Tonight with Vincent Browne and TV3\\'s late evening news, Vincent Browne and then Alan Cantwell, who respectively anchor these shows, announced to Irish television viewers that Binchy had died earlier that evening.[7]\\nImmediate media reports described Binchy as \"beloved\", \"Ireland\\'s most well-known novelist\" and the \"best-loved writer of her generation\".[5][7] Fellow writers mourned their loss, including Ian Rankin,[28] Jilly Cooper,[29] Anne Rice,[30] and Jeffrey Archer.[31] Politicians also paid tribute. President Michael D. Higgins stated: \"Our country mourns.\"[30] Taoiseach Enda Kenny said, \"Today we have lost a national treasure.\"[32] Minister of State at the Department of Health Kathleen Lynch, appearing as a guest on Tonight with Vincent Browne, said Binchy was, for her [Lynch\\'s] money, as worthy an Irish writer as James Joyce or Oscar Wilde, and praised her for selling so many more books than they managed.[33]\\nIn the days after her death tributes were published from such writers as John Banville,[34] Roddy Doyle,[35] and Colm Tóibín.[36] Banville contrasted Binchy with Gore Vidal, who died the day after her, observing that Vidal \"used to say that it was not enough for him to succeed, but others must fail. Maeve wanted everyone to be a success.\" Numerous tributes appeared in publications on both sides of the Atlantic, including The Guardian and CBC News.[37][38][39][40]\\nShortly before her death, Binchy told The Irish Times: \"I don\\'t have any regrets about any roads I didn\\'t take. Everything went well, and I think that\\'s been a help because I can look back, and I do get great pleasure out of looking back\\xa0... I\\'ve been very lucky and I have a happy old age with good family and friends still around.\"[5] Just before dying, she read her latest short story at the Dalkey Book Festival.[28] She once said she would like to die \"...\\xa0on my 100th birthday, piloting Gordon and myself into the side of a mountain\".[41]\\nDespite being agnostic, Binchy was given a traditional Requiem Mass which took place at the Church of the Assumption, in her hometown of Dalkey. She was later cremated at Mount Jerome Cemetery and Crematorium.[42][43]\\nThe New York Times reports: Binchy\\'s \"writing career began by accident in the early 1960s, after she spent time on a kibbutz in Israel. Her father was so taken with her letters home that \"he cut off the ‘Dear Daddy’ bits,” Ms. Binchy later recounted, and sent them to an Irish newspaper, which published them.\"[13] Donal Lynch observed of her first paying journalism role: the Irish Independent \"was impressed enough to commission her, paying her £16, which was then a week-and-a-half\\'s salary for her.\"[22]\\nIn 1968, Binchy joined the staff at The Irish Times, and worked there as a writer, columnist, the first Women\\'s Page editor[22] then the London editor,[44] later reporting for the paper from London before returning to Ireland.[13]\\nBinchy\\'s first published book is a compilation of her newspaper articles titled My First Book. Published in 1970, it is now out of print. As Binchy\\'s bio posted at Read Ireland describes: \"The Dublin section of the book contains insightful case histories that prefigure her novelist\\'s interest in character. The rest of the book is mainly humorous, and particularly droll is her account of a skiing holiday, \\'I Was a Winter Sport.\\'\"[45][46]\\nIn all, Binchy published 16 novels, four short-story collections, a play and a novella.[47] A 17th novel, A Week in Winter, was published posthumously.[48] Her literary career began with two books of short stories: Central Line (1978) and Victoria Line (1980). She published her debut novel Light a Penny Candle in 1982. In 1983, it sold for the largest sum ever paid for a first novel: £52,000. The timing was fortuitous, as Binchy and her husband were two months behind with the mortgage at the time.[49] However, the prolific Binchy – who joked that she could write as fast as she could talk – ultimately became one of Ireland\\'s richest women.[49][50]\\nHer first book was rejected five times. She would later describe these rejections as \"a slap in the face [...] It\\'s like if you don\\'t go to a dance you can never be rejected but you\\'ll never get to dance either\".[4]\\nMost of Binchy\\'s stories are set in Ireland, dealing with the tensions between urban and rural life, the contrasts between England and Ireland, and the dramatic changes in Ireland between World War II and the present day. Her books have been translated into 37 languages.[4]\\nWhile some of Binchy\\'s novels are complete stories (Circle of Friends, Light a Penny Candle), many others revolve around a cast of interrelated characters (The Copper Beech, Silver Wedding, The Lilac Bus, Evening Class, and Heart and Soul).  Her later novels, Evening Class, Scarlet Feather, Quentins, and Tara Road, feature a cast of recurring characters.\\nBinchy announced in 2000 that she would not tour any more of her novels, but would instead be devoting her time to other activities and to her husband, Gordon Snell. Five further novels were published before her death: Quentins (2002), Nights of Rain and Stars (2004), Whitethorn Woods (2006), Heart and Soul (2008), and Minding Frankie (2010).[23] Her final novel, A Week in Winter, was published posthumously in 2012.[13][51] In 2014 a collection of 36 unpublished short stories that she had written over a period of decades was published under the title Chestnut Street.[52][53]\\nBinchy wrote several dramas specifically for radio and the silver screen. Additionally, several of her novels and short stories were adapted for radio, film, and television.[16][17][18] (See List of Works: Films, radio and television.)\\nBinchy appeared on The Late Late Show on Saturday 20 March (based on chronology this would have been 1982) in connection with the publication of the Dublin 4 short story collection.[54] \"Then the conversation broadened and Gay Byrne asked about some aspects of my work, the royal weddings\", Binchy later recalled in a letter she sent to the programme.[54] \"I said how much I had liked Charles\\'s wedding and hated Anne\\'s - about covering the election in Ireland and how I had been one of the very few journalists watching FitzGerald and Haughey on the night of the Great Debate...\"[54]\\nFollowing the publication of Light a Penny Candle, the programme sought Binchy to reappear to explain her success.[54] In advance of her appearance she sent Mary O\\'Sullivan, who was working on the programme, a letter (the same one referred to above) setting out her earnings in some detail, since Binchy thought this would be of relevance.[54] She received an initial 5,000 Irish pounds for Light a Penny Candle.[54] The paperback rights were sold for a British record for a first novel with a prepublication advance of £52,000 from Coronet.[54] Viking Press paid Binchy $200,000 for the U.S. hardcover edition.[54] The Literary Guild of America paid a further $50,000.[54] The French publisher paid Binchy 50,000 francs.[54] Binchy wrote to O\\'Sullivan, \"I thought it would be better if you knew the exact figures, then you could decide what was and what was not relevant\".[54] O\\'Sullivan republished the letter in the Sunday Independent\\'s Living supplement in 2020 but mentioned that the last page, which followed on from Binchy referring to what she intended to do with all her money, was missing.[54]\\nIn 1994, Binchy appeared on Morningside with Peter Gzowski.[55]\\nIn 1999, Binchy appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show.[56] In 2009, she appeared on The Meaning of Life, also presented by Gay Byrne.[57] Binchy and her husband had a cameo appearance together in Fair City on 14 December 2011, during which the couple dined in The Hungry Pig.[58]\\nIn 1978, Binchy won a Jacob\\'s Award for her RTÉ play, Deeply Regretted By.

This one sold in 1970 and Maxwell used her first check to buy a greenhouse—something she had long wanted.[4]\\nMaxwell's early works, published under her own name, were mystery suspense novels.[2]  In the mid-1970s, this type of novel became less popular.

His father died shortly after his birth, and following the death of his mother, when Blair was eleven, he moved to the United States to live with an aunt. He wanted to return to Scotland, however, and got a part-time job at age fifteen to save up for his fare home. After graduating a year later from West Division High School in Milwaukee he returned to Glasgow to begin work with an insurance company. But he quickly became bored with the job and he moved to Australia at seventeen where he worked as a proof reader on the Sydney Bulletin newspaper, and as a lifeguard at Sydney\\'s South Steyne Beach.[2]\\nAfter a year in Australia he returned to his native Glasgow once again, where he worked as a feature writer on the Sunday Post. But following a visit to the cinema to see Burt Lancaster in The Flame and the Arrow he resolved to become an actor. He won a place at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and after graduating from there secured work with the Royal Shakespeare Company.[2] During a 20-year career in acting he appeared in many acclaimed television dramas. Among his television acting credits are roles in The Borderers, the police series The Sweeney and Juliet Bravo, The Brontes of Haworth, Rock Follies, The Saint and the sitcom Citizen Smith. In addition to these roles, he featured in an unbroadcast educational episode of Only Fools and Horses in which he portrays an \"oil man\" who cons David Jason\\'s Del Boy with a dodgy deal.[3]\\nHis acting career came to an end after an exchange with Steven Spielberg when he went to audition for a part in the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark. He once recalled a difficult journey to the studio followed by a lengthy wait: \"Eventually a rather small man came into the room. \\'I\\'m Steven Spielberg. Can you come back tomorrow?\\' he announced, not expecting a negative. \\'No, I fucking can\\'t,\\' I replied in traditional Glasgow fashion. And that was the end of my acting career.\"[2]\\nBlair began writing while a stage actor, doing so in his spare time. Initially he wrote plays for theatre and television, but later began to write novels. He started out as a thriller writer, but after being unsuccessful with this genre, switched to writing romantic fiction.[1] Upon submitting the first of these stories, titled Where No Man Cries, to his publishers in 1982, it was suggested the book would sell better if the author was a woman. Consequently, he adopted the pseudonym Emma Blair. Speaking about his change of name, he once joked: \"The publishers decided on a sex change and so that was that. Emma I became and Emma I stayed.\"[3] His wife, Jane Blanchard, has said of the Emma Blair nom de plume: \"Emma was not the quiet, retiring type but a 6ft 3in Glaswegian called Iain Blair who enjoyed a pint and a smoke.\"[3]\\nWhen No Man Cries, a story set in Glasgow during the inter war years, features a central character who overcomes social and financial hardships and ultimately finds the woman he loves. The book was an immediate success and generated good sales. Blair followed it with a series of other Emma Blair stories, many of them set in Scotland. Writing of Blair, The Scotsman\\'s Alasdair Steven said: \"Many of his books were of that genre: strongly romantic but very realistic. Blair had a fine ability to reflect social conditions within the body of his writing while the romantic element provides the main thrust to the story. He was a fine wordsmith and an exceptional story-teller...As he indeed demonstrated in two of his most acclaimed books. Flower of Scotland was about a family of whisky distillers in Perthshire as the First World War is about to break out. The family face many problems and as the war ends, they return to Scotland much changed.\"[3]\\nDuring a writing career spanning three decades he wrote some 30 novels,[3] but his true identity remained a secret until 1998 when his novel Flower of Scotland was nominated for the Romantic Novel of the Year Award,[2] something which required him to admit to being the author of the books.[1] He was one of Britain\\'s most popular authors and his books the most borrowed from British libraries.[4] He was forced to give up writing in 2007 after being diagnosed with diabetes. He died as a result of the condition at his home in Torquay, Devon, on 3 July 2011.[1]\\nBlair was married to the television producer and author Jane Blanchard. The couple lived in Torquay in Devon. Blair is survived by two sons from a previous marriage and a step son.[1]\\n',\n",

Her father was an engineer who had lost a leg while serving in the First World War.[4] She attended a nursery school in the Leeds suburb of Upper Armley alongside the writer Alan Bennett.[4] As a child during the Second World War, she held a jumble sale at her school and donated the £2 proceeds to the \"Aid to Russia\" fund. She later received a handwritten thank-you letter from Clementine Churchill, the wife of Prime Minister Winston Churchill.[5]\\nHer older brother Vivian died of meningitis before she was born. She later described her mother as having \"put all her frustrated love into me.\"[6] Her parents\\' marriage is fictionalized in her 1986 novel An Act of Will.[4]\\nIn her youth, Barbara Taylor read Charles Dickens, the Brontë sisters, Thomas Hardy, and Colette.[7]  At the age of ten she decided to be a writer after sending a story to a magazine. She was paid 7s 6d for the story, with which she bought handkerchiefs and a green vase for her parents.[4]\\nTaylor Bradford\\'s biographer, Piers Dudgeon, later uncovered evidence that her mother Freda Walker was the illegitimate daughter of Oliver Robinson, 2nd Marquess of Ripon, a local Yorkshire landowner who employed her mother, Edith Walker, as a servant. Dudgeon informed Taylor Bradford that her grandmother and Ripon had had three children together. After some hesitation, Taylor Bradford allowed Dudgeon to publish this information in his biography.[4] Although initially angry at Dudgeon\\'s discovery, she later said that \"I came round. There\\'s no stigma now.\"[4] Her grandmother later spent time in workhouses,[4] which Taylor Bradford explored in the ITV television series Secrets of the Workhouse (2013).[8]\\nTaylor left school aged 15. After working briefly in the newspaper\\'s typing pool, she became a reporter for the Yorkshire Evening Post.  While there, she worked alongside Keith Waterhouse.[4]\\nAt the age of twenty, she moved to London, where she later became the fashion editor of Woman\\'s Own magazine and a columnist for the London Evening News. She went on to write an interior decoration column syndicated to 183 newspapers.[4]\\nHer first fiction writing efforts were four suspense novels, a genre she later abandoned.[4] Taylor Bradford would subsequently describe \"interviewing herself\", saying that \"I was in my late thirties. I thought: what if I get to 55, and I\\'ve never written a novel? I\\'m going to hate myself. I\\'m going to be one of those bitter, unfulfilled writers.\"[4] Her debut novel, A Woman of Substance, became an enduring best-seller and, according to Reuters, ranks as one of the top-ten best-selling novels of all time.[9] It was followed by 38 other novels, all bestsellers in England and the United States.\\nTaylor Bradford\\'s works have sold more than 92 million copies worldwide in more than 90 countries and 40 languages.[citation needed]\\nTaylor Bradford considers Irish historian and author Cornelius Ryan her literary mentor. Ryan encouraged her writing and was the first person (other than her mother) to whom she had confided her literary ambitions.[10] Her favourite contemporary authors are P. D. James, Bernard Cornwell, and Ruth Rendell.[5]\\nA common pattern in her novels is a young woman of humble background rising in business through years of hard work, often involving enormous self-sacrifice. As Taylor Bradford is often quoted: \"I write about mostly ordinary women who go on to achieve the extraordinary.\"[11]\\nTen of Taylor Bradford\\'s books were made into television mini-series and television movies, produced by her husband Robert E. Bradford.[citation needed]\\nFive of her television adaptations were rereleased on DVD in the UK in September 2008 by Acorn Media UK:\\nTaylor Bradford met her husband, American film producer Robert E. Bradford, on a blind date in 1961 after being introduced by the English screenwriter Jack Davies.[4][12] They married on Christmas Eve 1963, and moved permanently to the United States. Taylor Bradford became an American citizen in 1992.[13]\\nIn December 2013, Taylor Bradford auctioned 40 pieces of jewellery given to her by her husband at Bonhams in London.[14] She donated the proceeds to two relatives in England.[citation needed]\\nTaylor Bradford received an honorary doctorate from Leeds University, the University of Bradford, Mount St. Mary\\'s College, Sienna College, and Post University.[4][13] She was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II as part of the 2007 Birthday Honours for her contributions to literature. Her original manuscripts are archived at the Leeds University Brotherton Library Special Collections beside those of the Brontë sisters.[15][13] In 2017, Bradford Taylor was recognised as one of 90 \"Great Britons\" to commemorate the Queen\\'s 90th birthday.\\nTaylor Bradford\\'s wealth is estimated at between £166–174 million, leading to rumours that she owns 2,000 pairs of shoes and that her former Connecticut home\\'s lake was heated for the benefit of her swans.[4][16][17] Taylor Bradford addressed the rumours in a 2011 interview, tracing the shoes rumour to a joke and the heated lake to the previous owners of the house who had installed it on part of the lake to provide an ice-free area for a pair of swans in winter.[18]\\nIn 1990 she was the subject of This Is Your Life where she was surprised by Michael Aspel at Heathrow Airport.[citation needed]\\nHer husband died in 2019.[6] Taylor Bradford lives in Manhattan, New York City.[4]\\nThe House of Falconer\\n',\n",

       " '\\nAnne Brontë (/ˈbrɒnti/, commonly /-teɪ/;[1] 17 January 1820 – 28 May 1849) was an English novelist and poet, and the youngest member of the Brontë literary family.\\nAnne Brontë was the daughter of Maria (née Branwell) and Patrick Brontë, a poor Irish clergyman in the Church of England. Anne lived most of her life with her family at the parish of Haworth on the Yorkshire moors. Otherwise, she attended a boarding school in Mirfield between 1836 and 1837, and between 1839 and 1845 lived elsewhere working as a governess. In 1846  she published a book of poems with her sisters and later two novels, initially under the pen name Acton Bell. Her first novel, Agnes Grey, was published in 1847 at the same time as Wuthering Heights by her sister Emily Brontë. Anne’s second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, was published in 1848. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is often considered one of the first feminist novels.[2]\\nAnne died at 29, most likely of pulmonary tuberculosis. After her death, her sister Charlotte edited Agnes Grey to fix issues with its first edition, but prevented republication of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. As a result, Anne is not as well known as her sisters. Nonetheless, both of her novels are considered classics of English literature.\\nAnne\\'s father was Patrick Brontë (1777–1861). Patrick Brontë was born in a two-room cottage in Emdale, Loughbrickland, County Down, Ireland.[3][4] He was the oldest of ten children born to Hugh Brunty and Eleanor McCrory, poor Irish peasant farmers.[5] The family surname, mac Aedh Ó Proinntigh, was Anglicised as Prunty or Brunty.[3] Struggling against poverty, Patrick learned to read and write, and from 1798 taught others. In 1802, at 25, he won a place to study theology at St. John\\'s College, Cambridge. Here he changed his name, Brunty, to the more distinguished sounding Brontë. In 1807, he was ordained in the priesthood in the Church of England.[6] He served as a curate in Essex and then in Wellington, Shropshire. In 1810, he published his first poem, Winter Evening Thoughts, in a local newspaper.[7] In 1811, he published a collection of moral verse, Cottage Poems.[8] Also in 1811, he became vicar of St. Peter\\'s Church in Hartshead, Yorkshire.[9] In 1812, he was appointed an examiner in Classics at Woodhouse Grove School, near Bradford. This was a Wesleyan academy where, at 35, he met his future wife, the headmaster\\'s niece, Maria Branwell.\\nMaria Branwell (1783–1821), Anne\\'s mother, was the daughter of Anne Carne, the daughter of a silversmith, and Thomas Branwell, a successful and property-owning grocer and tea merchant in Penzance.[10] Maria was the eleventh of twelve children and enjoyed the benefits of a prosperous family in a small town. After the death of her parents, Maria went to help her aunt with housekeeping functions at the school. Maria was intelligent and well read,[11] and her strong Methodist faith attracted Patrick Brontë, whose own leanings were similar.[12]\\nWithin three months, on 29 December 1812, though from considerably different backgrounds, Patrick Brontë and Maria Branwell were married.[13] Their first child, Maria (1814–1825), was born after they moved to Hartshead. In 1815, Patrick was appointed curate of the chapel in Market Street Thornton, near Bradford. A second daughter, Elizabeth (1815–1825), was born shortly after.[14] Four more children followed: Charlotte (1816–1855), Patrick Branwell (1817–1848), Emily (1818–1848), and Anne (1820–1849).\\nAnne was the youngest of the Brontë children. She was born on 17 January 1820 on the outskirts of Bradford.[15] Her father, Patrick, was curate there. Anne was baptised there on 25 March 1820. Later Patrick was appointed to the perpetual curacy in Haworth, a small town seven miles (11\\xa0km) away. In April 1820 the family moved into the five-roomed Haworth Parsonage.\\nWhen Anne was barely a year old her mother, Maria, became ill, probably with uterine cancer.[16] Maria Branwell died on 15 September 1821.[17] Patrick tried to remarry, without success.[18] Maria\\'s sister, Elizabeth Branwell (1776–1842), had moved to the parsonage initially for Maria, but spent the rest of her life there raising Maria\\'s children. She did it from a sense of duty. She was stern and expected respect, not love.[19] There was little affection between her and the older children. According to tradition Anne was her favourite.\\nIn Elizabeth Gaskell\\'s biography of Charlotte, Patrick remembered Anne as precocious. Patrick said that when Anne was four years old he had asked her what a child most wanted and that she had said: \"age and experience\".[20]\\nIn summer 1824 Patrick sent daughters Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, and Emily to Crofton Hall in Crofton, West Yorkshire, and subsequently to the Clergy Daughter\\'s School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire.[21] Maria and Elizabeth Brontë died of consumption on 6 May and 15 June 1825 respectively, and Charlotte and Emily were brought home.[20] The unexpected deaths distressed the family so much that Patrick could not face sending them away again. They were educated at home for the next five years, largely by Elizabeth Branwell and Patrick.[22] The children made little attempt to mix with others outside the parsonage and relied on each other for company. The bleak moors surrounding Haworth became their playground. Anne shared a room with her aunt, Elizabeth. They were close, and she may have influenced Anne\\'s personality and religious beliefs.[23]\\nAnne\\'s studies at home included music and drawing. The Keighley church organist gave piano lessons to Anne and Emily and Branwell, and John Bradley of Keighley gave them art lessons. Each drew with some skill.[24] Their aunt tried to teach the girls how to run a household, but they inclined more to literature.[25] They read much from their father\\'s well-stocked library. Their reading included the Bible, Homer, Virgil, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, Scott, articles from Blackwood\\'s Edinburgh Magazine and Fraser\\'s Magazine and The Edinburgh Review, and miscellaneous books of history and geography and biography.[26]\\nTheir reading fed their imaginations, and their creativity soared after their father gave Branwell a set of toy soldiers in June 1826. They gave names to the soldiers, or the \"Twelves\",[27] and developed their characters. This led to the creation of an imaginary world: the African kingdom of \"Angria\", which was illustrated with maps and watercolour renderings. The children devised plots about the inhabitants of Angria and its capital city, \"Glass Town\", later called Verreopolis or Verdopolis.[28]\\nTheir fantastical worlds and kingdoms gradually acquired characteristics from their historical world, drawing from its sovereigns, armies, heroes, outlaws, fugitives, inns, schools, and publishers. The characters and lands created by the children were given newspapers and magazines and chronicles written in tiny books with writing so small that it was difficult to read without a magnifying glass. These creations and writings were an apprenticeship for their later literary talents.[29]\\nAround 1831, when Anne was eleven, she and Emily broke away from Charlotte and Branwell to create and develop their own fantasy world, \"Gondal\". Anne and Emily were particularly close, especially after Charlotte left for Roe Head School in January 1831.[30] Charlotte\\'s friend Ellen Nussey visited Haworth in 1833 and reported that Emily and Anne were \"like twins\" and \"inseparable companions\". She described Anne so:\\nAnne, dear gentle Anne was quite different in appearance from the others, and she was her aunt\\'s favourite. Her hair was a very pretty light brown and fell on her neck in graceful curls. She had lovely violet-blue eyes; fine pencilled eyebrows and a clear almost transparent complexion. She still pursued her studies and especially her sewing, under the surveillance of her aunt.[31][32]Anne took lessons from Charlotte after Charlotte had returned from Roe Head. Charlotte returned to Roe Head as a teacher on 29 July 1835, accompanied by Emily as a pupil. Emily\\'s tuition was largely financed by Charlotte\\'s teaching. Emily was unable to adapt to life at school and was physically ill from homesickness within a few months. She was withdrawn from school by October and replaced by Anne.\\nAnne was 15 and it was her first time away from home. She made few friends at Roe Head. She was quiet and hardworking and determined to stay to acquire the education which she would need to support herself.[33][34] She stayed for two years and returned home only during Christmas and summer holidays. She won a good-conduct medal in December 1836. Charlotte\\'s letters almost never mention Anne while Anne was at Roe Head, which might imply that they were not close, but Charlotte was at least concerned about Anne\\'s health. By December 1837 Anne had become seriously ill with gastritis and embroiled in religious crisis.[35] A Moravian minister was called to see her several times during her illness, suggesting her distress was caused, in part, by conflict with the local Anglican clergy.[clarification needed] Charlotte wrote to their father and he brought Anne home.\\nA year after leaving the school, and aged 19, Anne was seeking a teaching position. She was the daughter of a poor clergyman and needed to earn money. Her father had no private income and the parsonage would revert to the church on his death. Teaching or working as a governess were among few options for a poor and educated woman. In April 1839 Anne started work as a governess for the Ingham family at Blake Hall, near Mirfield.[37]\\nThe children in her charge were spoiled and disobedient.[38] Anne had great difficulty controlling them and little success in educating them. She was not allowed to punish them, and when she complained about their behaviour she received no support and was criticised for being incapable. The Inghams were dissatisfied with their children\\'s progress and dismissed Anne.[39] She returned home in 1839 at Christmas. At home also were Charlotte and Emily, who had left their positions, and Branwell. Anne\\'s time at Blake Hall was so traumatic that she reproduced it in almost perfect[clarification needed] detail in her novel Agnes Grey.\\nAnne returned to Haworth and met William Weightman (1814–1842), her father\\'s new curate who had started work in the parish in August 1839.[40] Weightman was 25 and had obtained a two-year licentiate in theology from the University of Durham. He was welcome at the parsonage. Anne\\'s acquaintance with him parallels her writing a number of poems, which may suggest she fell in love with him[41][42][clarification needed] although there is disagreement over this possibility.[43] Little evidence exists beyond a small anecdote of Charlotte\\'s to Ellen Nussey in January 1842.[clarification needed]\\nIn Agnes Grey, Agnes\\' interest in the curate refreshes her interest in poetry. Outside fiction,  William Weightman aroused much curiosity. It seems that he was good-looking and engaging, and that his easy humour and kindness towards the sisters made an impression. It is such a character that she portrays in Edward Weston, and that her heroine Agnes Grey finds deeply appealing.[44][clarification needed]\\nWeightman died of cholera in the same year.[45] Anne expressed her grief for his death in her poem I will not mourn thee, lovely one, in which she called him \"our darling\".[40]\\nFrom 1840 to 1845 Anne worked at Thorp Green Hall, a comfortable country house near York. Here she was governess to the children of the Reverend Edmund Robinson and his wife, Lydia.[47][48] The house appeared as Horton Lodge in Agnes Grey. Anne had four pupils: Lydia (15), Elizabeth (13), Mary (12), and Edmund (8).[49] She initially had problems similar to those at Blake Hall. Anne missed her home and family. In a diary paper in 1841 she wrote that she did not like her situation and wished to leave it. Her quiet and gentle disposition did not help.[50] But Anne was determined and made a success of her position, becoming well-liked by her employers. Her charges, the Robinson girls, became lifelong friends.\\nAnne spent only five or six weeks a year with her family, during holidays at Christmas and in June. The rest of her time was spent with the Robinsons. She accompanied the Robinsons on annual holidays to Scarborough. Between 1840 and 1844 Anne spent around five weeks each summer at the coastal town and loved it.[51] A number of locations in Scarborough were used for her novels. She had opportunities to collect semi-precious stones,[52] considering an interest in geology, at least  in her novels,[53] or from personal experience, as something suitable for men and women to be considered as equals.[54]\\nAnne and her sisters considered setting up a school while she was still working for the Robinsons. Various locations were considered, including the parsonage, but the project never materialised. Anne came home on the death of her aunt in early November 1842 while her sisters were in Brussels.[55] Elizabeth Branwell left a £350 legacy (equivalent to £40,000 in 2021)[56] for each of her nieces.[57]\\nIt was at the Long Plantation at Thorp Green in 1842 that Anne wrote her three-verse poem Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day, which was published in 1846 under the name Acton Bell.[58]\\nIn January 1843 Anne returned to Thorp Green and secured a position for Branwell. He was to tutor Edmund, who was growing too old to be in Anne\\'s care. Branwell did not live in the house as Anne did. Anne\\'s vaunted calm appears to have been the result of hard-fought battles, balancing deeply felt emotions with careful thought, a sense of responsibility and resolute determination.[59][clarification needed] All three Brontë sisters worked as governesses or teachers, and all experienced problems controlling their charges, gaining support from their employers, and coping with homesickness, but Anne was the only one who persevered and made a success of her work.[60]\\nAnne and Branwell taught at Thorp Green for the next three years. Branwell entered into a secret relationship with his employer\\'s wife, Lydia Robinson.[clarification needed] When Anne and Branwell returned home for the holidays in June 1846 Anne resigned.[61] Anne gave no reason, but the reason may have been the relationship between her brother and Mrs Robinson.[62][clarification needed] Branwell was dismissed when his employer found out about the relationship. Anne continued to exchange letters with Elizabeth and Mary Robinson. They came to visit Anne in December 1848.[63]\\nAnne took Emily to visit some of the places which Anne had become fond of. A plan to visit Scarborough fell through, but they went to York and saw York Minster.[64]\\nThe Brontës were at home with their father during the summer of 1845. None had any immediate prospect of employment. Charlotte found Emily\\'s poems, which had been shared only with Anne. Charlotte said that they should be published. Anne showed her own poems to Charlotte, and Charlotte \"thought that these verses too had a sweet sincere pathos of their own\".[65][66] The sisters eventually reached an agreement.[clarification needed] They told nobody what they were doing. With the money from Elizabeth Branwell they paid for publication of a collection of poems, 21 from Anne and 21 from Emily and 19 from Charlotte.[60]\\nThe book was published under pen names which retained their initials but concealed their sex.[67] Anne\\'s pseudonym was Acton Bell. Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell was available for sale in May 1846. The cost of publication was 31 pounds and 10 shillings, about three-quarters of Anne\\'s salary at Thorp Green.[68][69] On 7 May 1846 the first three copies were delivered to Haworth Parsonage.[70] The book achieved three somewhat favourable reviews, but was a commercial failure, with only two copies sold in the first year. Anne nonetheless found a market for her later poetry. The Leeds Intelligencer and Fraser\\'s Magazine published her poem The Narrow Way under her pseudonym in December 1848. Four months earlier, Fraser\\'s Magazine had published her poem The Three Guides.\\nBy July 1846 a package containing the manuscripts of each sister\\'s first novel was making the rounds of London publishers. Charlotte had written The Professor, Emily had written Wuthering Heights, and Anne had written Agnes Grey.\\nAfter some rejections Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey were accepted by the publisher Thomas Cautley Newby. The Professor was rejected.[71] It was not long before Charlotte had completed her second novel, Jane Eyre. Jane Eyre was accepted immediately by Smith, Elder & Co. It was the first published of the sisters\\' novels, and an immediate and resounding success. Meanwhile, Anne and Emily\\'s novels \"lingered in the press\". Anne and Emily were obliged to pay fifty pounds to help meet their publishing costs. Their publisher was galvanised by the success of Jane Eyre and published Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey together in December 1847.[72] They sold well, but Agnes Grey was outshone by Emily\\'s more dramatic Wuthering Heights.[73]\\n\"Sick of mankind and their disgusting ways,\" scribbled Anne Brontë in pencil at the back of her Prayer Book.\\nStevie Davies, Introduction in The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Penguin Classics.\\n Anne\\'s second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, was published in the last week of June 1848.[75]\\nThe novel challenged contemporary social and legal structures. In 1913 May Sinclair said that the slamming of Helen Huntingdon\\'s bedroom door against her husband reverberated throughout Victorian England.[76]\\nIn the book Helen has left her husband to protect their son from his influence. She supports herself and her son in hiding by painting. She has violated social conventions and English law. Until the Married Women\\'s Property Act 1870 was passed, a married woman had no legal existence independent from her husband and could not own property nor sue for divorce nor control the custody of her children. Helen\\'s husband had a right to reclaim her and charge her with kidnapping. By subsisting on her own income she was stealing her husband\\'s property since this income was legally his.[60]\\nAnne stated her intentions in the second edition, published in August 1848. She presented a forceful rebuttal to critics (among them Charlotte) who considered her portrayal of Huntingdon overly graphic and disturbing. Anne \"wished to tell the truth\". She explained further that\\nWhen we have to do with vice and vicious characters, I maintain it is better to depict them as they really are than as they would wish to appear. To represent a bad thing in its least offensive light is doubtless the most agreeable course for a writer of fiction to pursue; but is it the most honest, or the safest? Is it better to reveal the snares and pitfalls of life to the young and thoughtless traveller, or to cover them with branches and flowers? O Reader! if there were less of this delicate concealment of facts\\xa0– this whispering \\'Peace, peace\\', when there is no peace,[77] there would be less of sin and misery to the young of both sexes who are left to wring their bitter knowledge from experience.[78]Anne also castigated reviewers who speculated on the sex of authors and the perceived appropriateness of their writing. She was\\nsatisfied that if a book is a good one, it is so whatever the sex of the author may be. All novels are or should be written for both men and women to read, and I am at a loss to conceive how a man should permit himself to write anything that would be really disgraceful to a woman, or why a woman should be censured for writing anything that would be proper and becoming for a man.[79]In July 1848 Anne and Charlotte went to Charlotte\\'s publisher George Smith in London to dispel the rumour that the \"Bell brothers\" were one person. Emily refused to go. Anne and Charlotte spent several days with Smith. Many years after Anne\\'s death, he wrote in the Cornhill Magazine his impressions of her:\\na gentle, quiet, rather subdued person, by no means pretty, yet of a pleasing appearance. Her manner was curiously expressive of a wish for protection and encouragement, a kind of constant appeal which invited sympathy.[80]The increasing popularity of the Bells\\' works led to renewed interest in Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, originally published by Aylott and Jones. The remaining print run was bought by Smith and Elder, and reissued under new covers in November 1848. It still sold poorly.\\nBranwell\\'s persistent drunkenness disguised the decline of his health and he died on 24 September 1848.[81] His sudden death shocked the family. He was 31. The cause was recorded as chronic bronchitis\\xa0– marasmus,[clarification needed] but was probably tuberculosis.[82]\\nThe family suffered from coughs and colds during the winter of 1848, and Emily became very ill. She worsened over two months and rejected medical aid until the morning of 19 December.[clarification needed] She was very weak and said that \"if you will send for a doctor, I will see him now\".[83] But Emily died at about two o\\'clock that afternoon, aged 30.[83]\\nEmily\\'s death deeply affected Anne. Her grief undermined her physical health.[84] Over Christmas Anne had influenza. Her symptoms intensified and in early January her father sent for a Leeds physician. The doctor diagnosed advanced consumption with little hope of recovery. Anne met the news with characteristic determination and self-control.[85][clarification needed] However, in her letter to Ellen Nussey she expressed her frustrated ambitions:\\nI have no horror of death: if I thought it inevitable I think I could quietly resign myself to the prospect\\xa0... But I wish it would please God to spare me not only for Papa\\'s and Charlotte\\'s sakes but because I long to do some good in the world before I leave it. I have many schemes in my head for future practise\\xa0– humble and limited indeed\\xa0– but still I should not like them all to come to nothing, and myself to have lived to so little purpose. But God\\'s will be done.[86]Unlike Emily, Anne took all the recommended medicines and followed the advice she was given.[87] That same month[clarification needed] she wrote her last poem, A dreadful darkness closes in, in which she deals with being terminally ill.[88] Her health fluctuated for months, but she grew thinner and weaker.\\nAnne seemed somewhat better in February.[89] She decided to visit Scarborough to see if the change of location and the fresh sea air might benefit her.[90] Charlotte was initially against the journey, fearing that it would be too stressful, but changed her mind after the doctor\\'s approval and Anne\\'s assurance that it was her last hope.[86]\\nOn 24 May 1849 Anne set off for Scarborough with Charlotte and Ellen Nussey. They spent a day and night in York en route. Here they escorted Anne in a wheelchair and did some shopping and visited York Minster. It was clear that Anne had little strength left.\\nOn Sunday 27 May Anne asked Charlotte whether it would be easier to return home and die instead of remaining in Scarborough. A doctor was consulted the next day and said that death was close. Anne received the news quietly. She expressed her love and concern for Ellen and Charlotte, and whispered for Charlotte to \"take courage\".[91] Anne died at about two o\\'clock in the afternoon on Monday 28 May 1849, aged 29.\\n\\nCharlotte decided to \"lay the flower where it had fallen\".[82] So Anne was buried in Scarborough. The funeral was held on 30 May. Patrick Brontë could not have made the 70-mile (110\\xa0km) journey if he had wished to. The former schoolmistress at Roe Head, Miss Wooler, was in Scarborough, and she was the only other mourner at Anne\\'s funeral.[92][clarification needed] Anne was buried in St Mary\\'s churchyard, beneath the castle walls and overlooking the bay. Charlotte commissioned a stone to be placed over her grave with the inscription, Here lie the remains of Anne Brontë, daughter of the Revd P. Brontë, Incumbent of Haworth, Yorkshire. She died Aged 28 May 28th 1849. When Charlotte visited the grave three years later she discovered multiple errors on the headstone and had it refaced, but it was still not free of error, for Anne was 29 when she died, not 28 as written.\\nIn 2011 the Brontë Society installed a new plaque at Anne Brontë\\'s grave. The original gravestone had become illegible at places and could not be restored. It was left undisturbed while the new plaque was laid horizontally, interpreting the fading words of the original and correcting its error.[93] In April 2013 the Brontë Society held a dedication and blessing service at the gravesite to mark the installation of the new plaque.[94][95]\\n\\nAfter Anne\\'s death Charlotte addressed issues with the first edition of Agnes Grey for its republication, but she prevented republication of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.[96] In 1850 Charlotte wrote that Wildfell Hall it hardly appears to me desirable to preserve. The choice of subject in that work is a mistake, it was too little consonant with the character, tastes and ideas of the gentle, retiring inexperienced writer.[97] Subsequent critics paid less attention to Anne\\'s work and some dismissed her as \"a Brontë without genius\".[98]\\nBut since the mid-20th century her life and works have been given better attention. Biographies by Winifred Gérin (1959), Elizabeth Langland (1989) and Edward Chitham (1991), as well as Juliet Barker\\'s group biography, The Brontës (1994; revised edition 2000), and work by critics such as Inga-Stina Ewbank, Marianne Thormählen, Laura C Berry, Jan B Gordon, Mary Summers, and Juliet McMaster has led to acceptance of Anne Brontë as a major literary figure.[85][99] Sally McDonald of the Brontë Society said in 2013 that in some ways Anne \"is now viewed as the most radical of the sisters, writing about tough subjects such as women\\'s need to maintain independence and how alcoholism can tear a family apart.\"[95] In 2016 Lucy Mangan championed Anne Brontë in the BBC\\'s Being the Brontës, declaring that \"her time has come\".[100]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nCharlotte Brontë (/ˈʃɑːrlət ˈbrɒnti/, commonly /-teɪ/;[1] 21 April 1816\\xa0– 31 March 1855) was an English novelist and poet, the eldest of the three Brontë sisters who survived into adulthood and whose novels became classics of English literature.\\nShe enlisted in school at Roe Head, Mirfield, in January 1831, aged 14 years. She left the year after to teach her sisters, Emily and Anne, at home, returning in 1835 as a governess. In 1839, she undertook the role of governess for the Sidgwick family, but left after a few months to return to Haworth, where the sisters opened a school but failed to attract pupils. Instead, they turned to writing and they each first published in 1846 under the pseudonyms of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Although her first novel, The Professor, was rejected by publishers, her second novel, Jane Eyre, was published in 1847. The sisters admitted to their Bell pseudonyms in 1848, and by the following year were celebrated in London literary circles.\\nCharlotte Brontë was the last to die of all her siblings. She became pregnant shortly after her marriage in June 1854 but died on 31 March 1855, almost certainly from hyperemesis gravidarum, a complication of pregnancy which causes excessive nausea and vomiting.[a]\\nCharlotte Brontë was born on 21 April 1816 in Market Street, Thornton, west of Bradford in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the third of the six children of Maria (née Branwell) and Patrick Brontë (formerly surnamed Brunty), an Irish Anglican clergyman. In 1820 her family moved a few miles to the village of Haworth, on the edge of the moors, where her father had been appointed perpetual curate of St Michael and All Angels Church. Maria died of cancer on 15 September 1821, leaving five daughters, Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, Emily and Anne, and a son, Branwell, to be taken care of by her sister, Elizabeth Branwell.\\nIn August 1824, Patrick sent Charlotte, Emily, Maria, and Elizabeth to the Clergy Daughters\\' School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire. Charlotte maintained that the school\\'s poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development, and hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died of tuberculosis in June 1825. After the deaths of his older daughters, Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school.[2] Charlotte used the school as the basis for Lowood School in Jane Eyre, which is similarly affected by tuberculosis that is exacerbated by the poor conditions.\\nAt home in Haworth Parsonage, Brontë acted as \"the motherly friend and guardian of her younger sisters\".[3] Brontë wrote her first known poem at the age of 13 in 1829, and was to go on to write more than 200 poems in the course of her life.[4] Many of her poems were \"published\" in their homemade magazine Branwell\\'s Blackwood\\'s Magazine, and concerned the fictional world of Glass Town.[4] She and her surviving siblings\\xa0– Branwell, Emily and Anne\\xa0– created this shared  world, and began chronicling the lives and struggles of the inhabitants of their imaginary kingdom in 1827.[5][6] Charlotte, in private letters, called Glass Town \"her \\'world below\\', a private escape where she could act out her desires and multiple identities\".[7] Charlotte\\'s \"predilection for romantic settings, passionate relationships, and high society is at odds with Branwell\\'s obsession with battles and politics and her young sisters\\' homely North Country realism, none the less at this stage there is still a sense of the writings as a family enterprise\".[8]\\nHowever, from 1831 onwards, Emily and Anne \\'seceded\\' from the Glass Town Confederacy to create a \\'spin-off\\' called Gondal, which included many of their poems.[9][10] After 1831, Charlotte and Branwell concentrated on an evolution of the Glass Town Confederacy called Angria.[5][11] Christine Alexander, a Brontë juvenilia historian,[12] wrote \"both Charlotte and Branwell ensured the consistency of their imaginary world. When Branwell exuberantly kills off important characters in his manuscripts, Charlotte comes to the rescue and, in effect, resurrects them for the next stories [...]; and when Branwell becomes bored with his inventions, such as the Glass Town magazine he edits, Charlotte takes over his initiative and keeps the publication going for several more years\".[13]:\\u200a6–7\\u200a The sagas the siblings created were episodic and elaborate, and they exist in incomplete manuscripts, some of which have been published as juvenilia. They provided them with an obsessive interest during childhood and early adolescence, which prepared them for literary vocations in adulthood.[5]\\nBetween 1831 and 1832, Brontë continued her education at a boarding school twenty miles away in Mirfield, Roe Head (now part of Hollybank Special School[14]), where she met her lifelong friends and correspondents Ellen Nussey and Mary Taylor.[2] In 1833 she wrote a novella, The Green Dwarf, using the name Wellesley. Around about 1833, her stories shifted from tales of the supernatural to more realistic stories.[15] She returned to Roe Head as a teacher from 1835 to 1838. Unhappy and lonely as a teacher at Roe Head, Brontë took out her sorrows in poetry, writing a series of melancholic poems.[16] In \"We wove a Web in Childhood\" written in December 1835, Brontë drew a sharp contrast between her miserable life as a teacher and the vivid imaginary worlds she and her siblings had created.[16] In another poem \"Morning was its freshness still\" written at the same time, Brontë wrote \"Tis bitter sometimes to recall/Illusions once deemed fair\".[16] Many of her poems concerned the imaginary world of Angria, often concerning Byronic heroes, and in December 1836 she wrote to the Poet Laureate Robert Southey asking him for encouragement of her career as a poet. Southey replied, famously, that \"Literature cannot be the business of a woman\\'s life, and it ought not to be. The more she is engaged in her proper duties, the less leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation.\" This advice she respected but did not heed.\\nIn 1839, she took up the first of many positions as governess to families in Yorkshire, a career she pursued until 1841. In particular, from May to July 1839 she was employed by the Sidgwick family at their summer residence, Stone Gappe, in Lothersdale, where one of her charges was John Benson Sidgwick (1835–1927), an unruly child who on one occasion threw the Bible at Charlotte, an incident that may have been the inspiration for a part of the opening chapter of Jane Eyre in which John Reed throws a book at the young Jane.[17] Brontë did not enjoy her work as a governess, noting her employers treated her almost as a slave, constantly humiliating her.[18]\\nBrontë was of slight build and was less than five feet tall.[19]\\nIn 1842 Charlotte and Emily travelled to Brussels to enrol at the boarding school run by Constantin Héger (1809–1896) and his wife Claire Zoé Parent Héger (1804–1887). During her time in Brussels, Brontë, who favoured the Protestant ideal of an individual in direct contact with God, objected to the stern Catholicism of Madame Héger, which she considered a tyrannical religion that enforced conformity and submission to the Pope.[20] In return for board and tuition Charlotte taught English and Emily taught music. Their time at the school was cut short when their aunt Elizabeth Branwell, who had joined the family in Haworth to look after the children after their mother\\'s death, died of internal obstruction in October 1842. Charlotte returned alone to Brussels in January 1843 to take up a teaching post at the school. Her second stay was not happy: she was homesick and deeply attached to Constantin Héger. She returned to Haworth in January 1844 and used the time spent in Brussels as the inspiration for some of the events in The Professor and Villette.\\nAfter returning to Haworth, Charlotte and her sisters made headway with opening their own boarding school in the family home. It was advertised as \"The Misses Brontë\\'s Establishment for the Board and Education of a limited number of Young Ladies\" and inquiries were made to prospective pupils and sources of funding. But none were attracted and in October 1844, the project was abandoned.[21]\\nIn May 1846 Charlotte, Emily, and Anne self-financed the publication of a joint collection of poems under their assumed names Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. The pseudonyms veiled the sisters\\' sex while preserving their initials; thus Charlotte was Currer Bell. \"Bell\" was the middle name of Haworth\\'s curate, Arthur Bell Nicholls whom Charlotte later married, and \"Currer\" was the surname of Frances Mary Richardson Currer who had funded their school (and maybe their father).[22] Of the decision to use noms de plume, Charlotte wrote:\\n Averse to personal publicity, we veiled our own names under those of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell; the ambiguous choice being dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women, because\\xa0– without at that time suspecting that our mode of writing and thinking was not what is called \"feminine\"\\xa0– we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice; we had noticed how critics sometimes use for their chastisement the weapon of personality, and for their reward, a flattery, which is not true praise.[23]Although only two copies of the collection of poems were sold, the sisters continued writing for publication and began their first novels, continuing to use their noms de plume when sending manuscripts to potential publishers.\\nBrontë\\'s first manuscript, \\'The Professor\\', did not secure a publisher, although she was heartened by an encouraging response from Smith, Elder & Co. of Cornhill, who expressed an interest in any longer works Currer Bell might wish to send.[24] Brontë responded by finishing and sending a second manuscript in August 1847. Six weeks later, Jane Eyre was published. It tells the story of a plain governess, Jane, who, after difficulties in her early life, falls in love with her employer, Mr Rochester. They marry, but only after Rochester\\'s insane first wife, of whom Jane initially has no knowledge, dies in a dramatic house fire. The book\\'s style was innovative, combining Romanticism, naturalism with gothic melodrama, and broke new ground in being written from an intensely evoked first-person female perspective.[25] Brontë believed art was most convincing when based on personal experience; in Jane Eyre she transformed the experience into a novel with universal appeal.[26]\\nJane Eyre had immediate commercial success and initially received favourable reviews. G. H. Lewes wrote that it was \"an utterance from the depths of a struggling, suffering, much-enduring spirit\", and declared that it consisted of \"suspiria de profundis!\" (sighs from the depths).[26] Speculation about the identity and gender of the mysterious Currer Bell heightened with the publication of Wuthering Heights by Ellis Bell (Emily) and Agnes Grey by Acton Bell (Anne).[27] Accompanying the speculation was a change in the critical reaction to Brontë\\'s work, as accusations were made that the writing was \"coarse\",[28] a judgement more readily made once it was suspected that Currer Bell was a woman.[29] However, sales of Jane Eyre continued to be strong and may even have increased as a result of the novel developing a reputation as an \"improper\" book.[30] A talented amateur artist, Brontë personally did the drawings for the second edition of Jane Eyre and in the summer of 1834 two of her paintings were shown at an exhibition by the Royal Northern Society for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Leeds.[20]\\nIn 1848 Brontë began work on the manuscript of her second novel, Shirley. It was only partially completed when the Brontë family suffered the deaths of three of its members within eight months. In September 1848 Branwell died of chronic bronchitis and marasmus, exacerbated by heavy drinking, although Brontë believed that his death was due to tuberculosis. Branwell may have had a laudanum addiction. Emily became seriously ill shortly after his funeral and died of pulmonary tuberculosis in December 1848. Anne died of the same disease in May 1849. Brontë was unable to write at this time.\\nAfter Anne\\'s death Brontë resumed writing as a way of dealing with her grief,[31] and Shirley, which deals with themes of industrial unrest and the role of women in society, was published in October 1849. Unlike Jane Eyre, which is written in the first person, Shirley is written in the third person and lacks the emotional immediacy of her first novel,[32] and reviewers found it less shocking.  Brontë, as her late sister\\'s heir, suppressed the republication of Anne\\'s second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, an action which had a deleterious effect on Anne\\'s popularity as a novelist and has remained controversial among the sisters\\' biographers ever since.[33]\\nIn view of the success of her novels, particularly Jane Eyre, Brontë was persuaded by her publisher to make occasional visits to London, where she revealed her true identity and began to move in more exalted social circles, becoming friends with  Elizabeth Gaskell and Harriet Martineau whose sister Rachel had taught Gaskell\\'s daughters.[34] Brontë sent an early copy of Shirley  to Martineau whose home  at Ambleside she   visited.  The two friends  shared an interest in racial relations and the abolitionist movement; recurrent themes in their writings.[35][36]  Brontë was also  acquainted with William Makepeace Thackeray and G.H. Lewes. She never left Haworth for more than a few weeks at a time, as she did not want to leave her ageing father.  Thackeray\\'s daughter, writer Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie, recalled a visit to her father by Brontë:\\n …two gentlemen come in, leading a tiny, delicate, serious, little lady, with fair straight hair and steady eyes. She may be a little over thirty; she is dressed in a little barège dress with a pattern of faint green moss. She enters in mittens, in silence, in seriousness; our hearts are beating with wild excitement. This then is the authoress, the unknown power whose books have set all London talking, reading, speculating; some people even say our father wrote the books\\xa0– the wonderful books.  …The moment is so breathless that dinner comes as a relief to the solemnity of the occasion, and we all smile as my father stoops to offer his arm; for, genius though she may be, Miss Brontë can barely reach his elbow. My own personal impressions are that she is somewhat grave and stern, specially to forward little girls who wish to chatter.  …Everyone waited for the brilliant conversation which never began at all. Miss Brontë retired to the sofa in the study, and murmured a low word now and then to our kind governess… the conversation grew dimmer and more dim, the ladies sat round still expectant, my father was too much perturbed by the gloom and the silence to be able to cope with it at all… after Miss Brontë had left, I was surprised to see my father opening the front door with his hat on. He put his fingers to his lips, walked out into the darkness, and shut the door quietly behind him… long afterwards… Mrs Procter asked me if I knew what had happened.  …It was one of the dullest evenings [Mrs Procter] had ever spent in her life… the ladies who had all come expecting so much delightful conversation, and the gloom and the constraint, and how finally, overwhelmed by the situation, my father had quietly left the room, left the house, and gone off to his club.[37]Brontë\\'s friendship with Elizabeth Gaskell, while not particularly close, was significant in that Gaskell wrote the first biography of Brontë after her death in 1855.\\nBrontë\\'s third novel, the last published in her lifetime, was Villette, which appeared in 1853. Its main themes include isolation, how such a condition can be borne,[38] and the internal conflict brought about by social repression of individual desire.[39] Its main character, Lucy Snowe, travels abroad to teach in a boarding school in the fictional town of Villette, where she encounters a culture and religion different from her own and falls in love with a man (Paul Emanuel) whom she cannot marry. Her experiences result in a breakdown but eventually, she achieves independence and fulfilment through running her own school. A substantial amount of the novel\\'s dialogue is in the French language. Villette marked Brontë\\'s return to writing from a first-person perspective (that of Lucy Snowe), the technique she had used in Jane Eyre. Another similarity to Jane Eyre lies in the use of aspects of her own life as inspiration for fictional events,[39] in particular her reworking of the time she spent at the pensionnat in Brussels. Villette was acknowledged by critics of the day as a potent and sophisticated piece of writing although it was criticised for \"coarseness\" and for not being suitably \"feminine\" in its portrayal of Lucy\\'s desires.[40]\\nBefore the publication of Villette, Brontë received an expected proposal of marriage from Irishman Arthur Bell Nicholls, her father\\'s curate, who had long been in love with her.[43] She initially refused him and her father objected to the union at least partly because of Nicholls\\'s poor financial status. Elizabeth Gaskell, who believed that marriage provided \"clear and defined duties\" that were beneficial for a woman,[44] encouraged Brontë to consider the positive aspects of such a union and tried to use her contacts to engineer an improvement in Nicholls\\'s finances. According to James Pope-Hennessy in The Flight of Youth, it was the generosity of Richard Monckton Milnes that made the marriage possible. Brontë, meanwhile, was increasingly attracted to Nicholls and by January 1854, she had accepted his proposal. They gained the approval of her father by April and married in June.[45] Her father Patrick had intended to give Charlotte away, but at the last minute decided he could not, and Charlotte had to make her way to the church without him.[46] The married couple took their honeymoon in Banagher, County Offaly, Ireland.[47] By all accounts, her marriage was a success and Brontë found herself very happy in a way that was new to her.[43]\\nBrontë became pregnant soon after her wedding, but her health declined rapidly and, according to Gaskell, she was attacked by \"sensations of perpetual nausea and ever-recurring faintness\".[48] She died, with her unborn child, on 31 March 1855, three weeks before her 39th birthday. Her death certificate gives the cause of death as phthisis,[49] but biographers including Claire Harman and others suggest that she died from dehydration and malnourishment due to vomiting caused by severe morning sickness or hyperemesis gravidarum.[50] Brontë was buried in the family vault in the Church of St Michael and All Angels at Haworth.\\nThe Professor, the first novel Brontë had written, was published posthumously in 1857. The fragment of a new novel she had been writing in her last years has been twice completed by recent authors, the more famous version being Emma Brown: A Novel from the Unfinished Manuscript by Charlotte Brontë by Clare Boylan in 2003. Most of her writings about the imaginary country Angria have also been published since her death. In 2018, The New York Times published a belated obituary for her.[51]\\nThe daughter of an Irish Anglican clergyman, Brontë was herself an Anglican. In a letter to her publisher, she claims to \"love the Church of England. Her Ministers indeed, I do not regard as infallible personages, I have seen too much of them for that – but to the Establishment, with all her faults – the profane Athanasian Creed excluded – I am sincerely attached.\"[52]\\nIn a letter to Ellen Nussey she wrote: \\nIf I could always live with you, and daily read the bible with you, if your lips and mine could at the same time, drink the same draught from the same pure fountain of Mercy – I hope, I trust, I might one day become better, far better, than my evil wandering thoughts, my corrupt heart, cold to the spirit, and warm to the flesh will now permit me to be.[52]Elizabeth Gaskell\\'s biography The Life of Charlotte Brontë was published in 1857. It was an important step for a leading female novelist to write a biography of another,[53] and Gaskell\\'s approach was unusual in that, rather than analysing her subject\\'s achievements, she concentrated on private details of Brontë\\'s life, emphasising those aspects that countered the accusations of \"coarseness\" that had been levelled at her writing.[53] The biography is frank in places, but omits details of Brontë\\'s love for Héger, a married man, as being too much of an affront to contemporary morals and a likely source of distress to Brontë\\'s father, widower, and friends.[54] Mrs. Gaskell also provided doubtful and inaccurate information about Patrick Brontë, claiming that he did not allow his children to eat meat. This is refuted by one of Emily Brontë\\'s diary papers, in which she describes preparing meat and potatoes for dinner at the parsonage.[55] It has been argued that Gaskell\\'s approach transferred the focus of attention away from the \\'difficult\\' novels, not just Brontë\\'s, but all the sisters\\', and began a process of sanctification of their private lives.[56]\\nBrontë held lifelong correspondence with her former schoolmate Ellen Nussey. 350 of the some 500 letters sent by Brontë to Nussey survive, whereas all of Nussey\\'s letters to Brontë were burned at Nicholls\\'s request.[57] The surviving letters provide most of the information known on Charlotte Brontë\\'s life and are the backbone of her autobiographies.\\nBrontë\\'s letters to Nussey seem to have romantic undertones:\\nWhat shall I do without you? How long are we likely to be separated? Why are we to be denied each other\\'s society- I long to be with you. Why are we to be divided? Surely, Ellen, it must be because we are in danger of loving each other too well-[58]Ellen, I wish I could live with you always. I begin to cling to you more fondly than ever I did. If we had but a cottage and a competency of our own, I do think we might live and love on till Death without being dependent on any third person for happiness...\\n[59]how sorely my heart longs for you I need not say... Less than ever can I taste or know pleasure till this work is wound up. And yet I often sit up in bed at night, thinking of and wishing for you.\\n[60]Some scholars believe it is possible that Charlotte Brontë was in a romantic or sexual relationship with Ellen Nussey. Brontë would certainly have been aware of female same-sex attraction as she lived near Anne Lister.\\nOn 29 July 1913 The Times of London printed four letters Brontë had written to Constantin Héger after leaving Brussels in 1844.[61] Written in French except for one postscript in English, the letters broke the prevailing image of Brontë as an angelic martyr to Christian and female duties that had been constructed by many biographers, beginning with Gaskell.[61] The letters, which formed part of a larger and somewhat one-sided correspondence in which Héger frequently appears not to have replied, reveal that she had been in love with a married man, although they are complex and have been interpreted in numerous ways, including as an example of literary self-dramatisation and an expression of gratitude from a former pupil.[61]\\nIn 1980 a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels, on the site of the Madam Heger\\'s school, in honour of Charlotte and Emily.[62]\\nThe Green Dwarf, A Tale of the Perfect Tense was written in 1833 under the pseudonym Lord Charles Albert Florian Wellesley.[69] It shows the influence of Walter Scott, and Brontë\\'s modifications to her earlier gothic style have led Christine Alexander to comment that, in the work, \"it is clear that Brontë was becoming tired of the gothic mode per se\".[70]\\n\"At the end of 1839, Brontë said goodbye to her fantasy world in a manuscript called Farewell to Angria. More and more, she was finding that she preferred to escape to her imagined worlds over remaining in reality – and she feared that she was going mad. So she said goodbye to her characters, scenes and subjects. [...] She wrote of the pain she felt at wrenching herself from her \\'friends\\' and venturing into lands unknown\".[7]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nEmily Jane Brontë (/ˈbrɒnti/, commonly /-teɪ/;[2] 30 July 1818 – 19 December 1848)[3] was an English novelist and poet who is best known for her only novel, Wuthering Heights, now considered a classic of English literature. She also published a book of poetry with her sisters Charlotte and Anne titled Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell with her own poems finding regard as poetic genius. Emily was the second-youngest of the four surviving Brontë siblings, between the youngest Anne and her brother Branwell. She published under the pen name Ellis Bell.\\nEmily Brontë was born on 30 July 1818 to Maria Branwell and an Irish father, Patrick Brontë. The family was living on Market Street in the village of Thornton on the outskirts of Bradford, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England.  Emily was the second youngest of six siblings, preceded by Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte and Branwell.  In 1820, Emily\\'s younger sister Anne, the last Brontë child, was born. Shortly thereafter, the family moved eight miles away to Haworth, where Patrick was employed as perpetual curate.[4]  In Haworth, the children would have opportunities to develop their literary talents.[4]\\nWhen Emily was only three, and all six children under the age of eight, she and her siblings lost their mother, Maria, to cancer on 15 September 1821.[5] The younger children were to be cared for by Elizabeth Branwell, their aunt and Maria\\'s sister.\\nEmily\\'s three elder sisters, Maria, Elizabeth, and Charlotte were sent to the Clergy Daughters\\' School at Cowan Bridge. At the age of six, on 25 November 1824, Emily joined her sisters at school for a brief period.[6] At school, however, the children suffered abuse and privations, and when a typhoid epidemic swept the school, Maria and Elizabeth became ill. Maria, who may actually have had tuberculosis, was sent home, where she died. Elizabeth died shortly after.\\nThe four youngest Brontë children, all under ten years of age, had suffered the loss of the three eldest women in their immediate family.[7]\\nCharlotte maintained that the school\\'s poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development and that it had hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died in 1825. After the deaths of his older daughters, Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school.[8] Charlotte would use her experiences and knowledge of the school as the basis for Lowood School in Jane Eyre.\\nThe three remaining sisters and their brother Branwell were thereafter educated at home by their father and aunt Elizabeth Branwell. A shy girl, Emily was very close to her siblings and was known as a great animal lover, especially for befriending stray dogs she found wandering around the countryside.[9] Despite the lack of formal education, Emily and her siblings had access to a wide range of published material; favourites included Sir Walter Scott, Byron, Shelley, and Blackwood\\'s Magazine.[10]\\nInspired by a box of toy soldiers Branwell had received as a gift,[11] the children began to write stories, which they set in a number of invented imaginary worlds populated by their soldiers as well as their heroes, the Duke of Wellington and his sons, Charles and Arthur Wellesley. Little of Emily\\'s work from this period survives, except for poems spoken by characters.[12][13] Initially, all four children shared in creating stories about a world called Angria.\\nHowever, when Emily was 13, she and Anne withdrew from participation in the Angria story and began a new one about Gondal, a fictional island whose myths and legends were to preoccupy the two sisters throughout their lives. With the exception of their Gondal poems and Anne\\'s lists of Gondal\\'s characters and placenames, Emily and Anne\\'s Gondal writings were largely not preserved. Among those that did survive are some \"diary papers\", written by Emily in her twenties, which describe current events in Gondal.[14] The heroes of Gondal tended to resemble the popular image of the Scottish Highlander, a sort of British version of the \"noble savage\": romantic outlaws capable of more nobility, passion, and bravery than the denizens of \"civilization\".[15] Similar themes of romanticism and noble savagery are apparent across the Brontës\\' juvenilia, notably in Branwell\\'s The Life of Alexander Percy, which tells the story of an all-consuming, death-defying, and ultimately self-destructive love and is generally considered an inspiration for Wuthering Heights.[16]\\nAt seventeen, Emily began to attend the Roe Head Girls\\' School, where Charlotte was a teacher, but suffered from extreme homesickness and left after only a few months. Charlotte wrote later that \"Liberty was the breath of Emily\\'s nostrils; without it, she perished. The change from her own home to a school and from her own very noiseless, very secluded but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life, to one of disciplined routine (though under the kindest auspices), was what she failed in enduring... I felt in my heart she would die if she did not go home, and with this conviction obtained her recall.\"[17] Emily returned home and Anne took her place.[18][a] At this time, the girls\\' objective was to obtain sufficient education to open a small school of their own.\\nEmily became a teacher at Law Hill School in Halifax beginning in September 1838, when she was twenty.[19] Her always fragile health soon broke under the stress of the 17-hour workday, and she returned home in April 1839.[20] Thereafter she remained at home, doing most of the cooking, ironing, and cleaning at Haworth. She taught herself German out of books and also practised the piano.[21]\\nIn 1842, Emily accompanied Charlotte to the Héger Pensionnat in Brussels, Belgium, where they attended the girls\\' academy run by Constantin Héger in the hope of perfecting their French and German before opening their school. Unlike Charlotte, Emily was uncomfortable in Brussels, and refused to adopt Belgian fashions, saying \"I wish to be as God made me\", which rendered her something of an outcast.[22] Nine of Emily\\'s French essays survive from this period. Héger seems to have been impressed with the strength of Emily\\'s character, writing that:\\nThe two sisters were committed to their studies and by the end of the term had become so competent in French that Madame Héger proposed that they both stay another half-year, even, according to Charlotte, offering to dismiss the English master so that she could take his place. Emily had, by this time, become a competent pianist and teacher and it was suggested that she might stay on to teach music.[24] However, the illness and death of their aunt drove them to return to their father and Haworth.[25] In 1844, the sisters attempted to open a school in their house, but their plans were stymied by an inability to attract students to the remote area.[26]\\nIn 1844, Emily began going through all the poems she had written, recopying them neatly into two notebooks. One was labelled \"Gondal Poems\"; the other was unlabelled. Scholars such as Fannie Ratchford and Derek Roper have attempted to piece together a Gondal storyline and chronology from these poems.[27][28]\\nIn the autumn of 1845, Charlotte discovered the notebooks and insisted that the poems be published. Emily, furious at the invasion of her privacy, at first refused but relented when Anne brought out her own manuscripts and revealed to Charlotte that she had been writing poems in secret as well. As co-authors of Gondal stories, Anne and Emily were accustomed to read their Gondal stories and poems to each other, while Charlotte was excluded from their privacy.[29] Around this time Emily had written one of her most famous poems \"No coward soul is mine\", probably as an answer to the violation of her privacy and her own transformation into a published writer.[30] Despite Charlotte\\'s later claim, it was not her last poem.[31]\\nIn 1846, the sisters\\' poems were published in one volume as Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. The Brontë sisters had adopted pseudonyms for publication, preserving their initials: Charlotte was \"Currer Bell\", Emily was \"Ellis Bell\" and Anne was \"Acton Bell\".[32] Charlotte wrote in the \\'Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell\\' that their \"ambiguous choice\" was \"dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women, because... we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice\".[33] Charlotte contributed 19 poems, and Emily and Anne each contributed 21. Although the sisters were told several months after publication that only two copies had sold,[34] they were not discouraged (of their two readers, one was impressed enough to request their autographs).[35] The Athenaeum reviewer praised Ellis Bell\\'s work for its music and power, singling out his poems as the best: \"Ellis possesses a fine, quaint spirit and an evident power of wing that may reach heights not here attempted\",[36] and The Critic reviewer recognised \"the presence of more genius than it was supposed this utilitarian age had devoted to the loftier exercises of the intellect.\"[37]\\nEmily Brontë\\'s solitary and reclusive nature has made her a mysterious figure and a challenge for biographers to assess.[38][39] Except for Ellen Nussey and Louise de Bassompierre, Emily\\'s fellow student in Brussels, she does not seem to have made any friends outside her family. Her closest friend was her sister Anne. Together they shared their own fantasy world, Gondal, and, according to Ellen Nussey, in childhood they were \"like twins\", \"inseparable companions\" and \"in the very closest sympathy which never had any interruption\".[40][41] In 1845 Anne took Emily to visit some of the places she had come to know and love in the five years she spent as governess. A plan to visit Scarborough fell through and instead the sisters went to York where Anne showed Emily York Minster. During the trip the sisters acted out some of their Gondal characters.[42]\\nCharlotte Brontë remains the primary source of information about Emily, although as an elder sister, writing publicly about her only shortly after her death, she is considered by certain scholars not to be a neutral witness. Stevie Davies believes that there is what might be called \"Charlotte\\'s smoke-screen\", and argues that Emily evidently shocked her, to the point where she may even have doubted her sister\\'s sanity. After Emily\\'s death, Charlotte rewrote her character, history and even poems on a more acceptable (to her and the bourgeois reading public) model.[43] Biographer Claire O\\'Callaghan suggests that the trajectory of Brontë\\'s legacy was altered significantly by Elizabeth Gaskell\\'s biography of Charlotte, concerning not only because Gaskell did not visit Haworth until after Emily\\'s death, but also because Gaskell admits to disliking what she did know of Emily in her biography of Charlotte.[44] As O\\'Callaghan and others have noted, Charlotte was Gaskell\\'s primary source of information on Emily\\'s life and may have exaggerated or fabricated Emily\\'s frailty and shyness to cast herself in the role of maternal saviour.[45][46]\\nCharlotte presented Emily as someone whose \"natural\" love of the beauties of nature had become somewhat exaggerated owing to her shy nature, portraying her as too fond of the Yorkshire moors, and homesick whenever she was away.[47] According to Lucasta Miller, in her analysis of Brontë biographies, \"Charlotte took on the role of Emily\\'s first mythographer.\"[48] In the Preface to the Second Edition of Wuthering Heights, in 1850, Charlotte wrote:\\nMy sister\\'s disposition was not naturally gregarious; circumstances favoured and fostered her tendency to seclusion; except to go to church or take a walk on the hills, she rarely crossed the threshold of home. Though her feeling for the people round was benevolent, intercourse with them she never sought; nor, with very few exceptions, ever experienced. And yet she knew them: knew their ways, their language, their family histories; she could hear of them with interest, and talk of them with detail, minute, graphic, and accurate; but WITH them, she rarely exchanged a word.[49]\\nEmily\\'s unsociability and extremely shy nature have subsequently been reported many times.[50][51][52] According to Norma Crandall, her \"warm, human aspect\" was \"usually revealed only in her love of nature and of animals\".[53] In a similar description, Literary news (1883) states: \"[Emily] loved the solemn moors, she loved all wild, free creatures and things\",[54] and critics attest that her love of the moors is manifest in Wuthering Heights.[55] Over the years, Emily\\'s love of nature has been the subject of many anecdotes. A newspaper dated 31 December 1899, gives the folksy account that \"with bird and beast [Emily] had the most intimate relations, and from her walks she often came with fledgling or young rabbit in hand, talking softly to it, quite sure, too, that it understood\".[56] Elizabeth Gaskell, in her biography of Charlotte, told the story of Emily\\'s punishing her pet dog Keeper for lying \"on the delicate white counterpane\" that covered one of the beds in the Parsonage. According to Gaskell, she struck him with her fists until he was \"half-blind\" with his eyes \"swelled up\". This story is apocryphal,[57][b] and contradicts the following account of Emily\\'s and Keeper\\'s relationship:\\nPoor old Keeper, Emily\\'s faithful friend and worshipper, seemed to understand her like a human being. One evening, when the four friends were sitting closely round the fire in the sitting-room, Keeper forced himself in between Charlotte and Emily and mounted himself on Emily\\'s lap; finding the space too limited for his comfort he pressed himself forward on to the guest\\'s knees, making himself quite comfortable. Emily\\'s heart was won by the unresisting endurance of the visitor, little guessing that she herself, being in close contact, was the inspiring cause of submission to Keeper\\'s preference. Sometimes Emily would delight in showing off Keeper—make him frantic in action, and roar with the voice of a lion. It was a terrifying exhibition within the walls of an ordinary sitting-room. Keeper was a solemn mourner at Emily\\'s funeral and never recovered his cheerfulness.[59]\\nIn Queens of Literature of the Victorian Era (1886), Eva Hope summarises Emily\\'s character as \"a peculiar mixture of timidity and Spartan-like courage\", and goes on to say, \"She was painfully shy, but physically she was brave to a surprising degree. She loved few persons, but those few with a passion of self-sacrificing tenderness and devotion. To other people\\'s failings she was understanding and forgiving, but over herself she kept a continual and most austere watch, never allowing herself to deviate for one instant from what she considered her duty.\"[60]\\nEmily Brontë has often been characterised as a devout if somewhat unorthodox Christian, a heretic and a visionary \"mystic of the moors\".[61]\\nEmily Brontë\\'s Wuthering Heights was first published in London in 1847 by Thomas Cautley Newby, appearing as the first two volumes of a three-volume set that included Anne Brontë\\'s Agnes Grey. The authors were printed as being Ellis and Acton Bell; Emily\\'s real name did not appear until 1850, when it was printed on the title page of an edited commercial edition.[62] The novel\\'s innovative structure somewhat puzzled critics.\\nWuthering Heights\\'s violence and passion led the Victorian public and many early reviewers to think that it had been written by a man.[63] According to Juliet Gardiner, \"the vivid sexual passion and power of its language and imagery impressed, bewildered and appalled reviewers.\"[64] Literary critic Thomas Joudrey further contextualizes this reaction: \"Expecting in the wake of Charlotte Brontë\\'s Jane Eyre to be swept up in an earnest Bildungsroman, they were instead shocked and confounded by a tale of unchecked primal passions, replete with savage cruelty and outright barbarism.\"[65] Even though the novel received mixed reviews when it first came out, and was often condemned for its portrayal of amoral passion, the book subsequently became an English literary classic.[66] Emily Brontë never knew the extent of fame she achieved with her only novel, as she died a year after its publication, aged 30.\\nAlthough a letter from her publisher indicates that Emily had begun to write a second novel, the manuscript has never been found. Perhaps Emily or a member of her family eventually destroyed the manuscript, if it existed, when she was prevented by illness from completing it. It has also been suggested that, though less likely, the letter could have been intended for Anne Brontë, who was already writing The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, her second novel.[67]\\nEmily\\'s health was probably weakened by the harsh local climate and by unsanitary conditions at home,[68]  where water was contaminated by run off from the church\\'s graveyard.[c] Branwell died suddenly, on Sunday, 24 September 1848. At his funeral service, a week later, Emily caught a severe cold that quickly developed into inflammation of the lungs and led to tuberculosis.[69][d] Though her condition worsened steadily, she rejected medical help and all offered remedies, saying that she would have \"no poisoning doctor\" near her.[71] On the morning of 19 December 1848, Charlotte, fearing for her sister, wrote:\\nShe grows daily weaker. The physician\\'s opinion was expressed too obscurely to be of use – he sent some medicine which she would not take. Moments so dark as these I have never known – I pray for God\\'s support to us all.[72]\\nAt noon, Emily was worse; she could only whisper in gasps. With her last audible words, she said to Charlotte, \"If you will send for a doctor, I will see him now\",[73] but it was too late. She died that same day at about two in the afternoon. According to Mary Robinson, an early biographer of Emily, it happened while she was sitting on the sofa.[74] However, Charlotte\\'s letter to William Smith Williams where she mentions Emily\\'s dog, Keeper, lying at the side of her dying-bed, makes this statement seem unlikely.[75]\\nIt was less than three months after Branwell\\'s death, which led Martha Brown, a housemaid, to declare that \"Miss Emily died of a broken heart for love of her brother\".[76] Emily had grown so thin that her coffin measured only 16 inches (40 centimeters) wide. The carpenter said he had never made a narrower one for an adult.[77] Her remains were interred in the family vault in St Michael and All Angels\\' Church, Haworth.\\nThe English folk group The Unthanks released Lines, a trilogy of short albums, which includes settings of Brontë\\'s poems to music and was recorded at the Brontës\\' parsonage home, using their own Regency era piano, played by Adrian McNally.[78]\\nIn the 2019 film How to Build a Girl, Emily and Charlotte Brontë are among the historical figures in Johanna\\'s wall collage.[79]\\nIn May 2021, the contents of the Honresfield library, a collection of rare books and manuscripts first assembled by Rochdale mill owners Alfred and William Law, re-emerged after being out of public view for nearly a century. In the collection were handwritten poems by Emily Brontë, as well as the Brontë family edition of Bewick\\'s \\'History of British Birds.\\' The collection was to be auctioned off at Sotheby\\'s and was estimated to sell for £1\\xa0million.[80][81]\\nThe 1946 film Devotion was a highly fictionalized account of the lives of the Brontë sisters.[82][83]\\nIn the 2022 film Emily, written and directed by Frances O\\'Connor, Emma Mackey plays Emily before the publication of Wuthering Heights.

In 2003 Three Times a Lady was selected by the Books for the Blind (Talking Books) program to be transcribed into an audio recording supplied free of charge to people who are blind or visually impaired.[4] Her romances, \"Make You Mine\" and \"Red Hot\" won for the 2009 and 2013 Romantic Times Best African-American Romance Awards, respectively.\\nIn 2007, her first mainstream Live and Learn was published by Kensington Publishing.  In her mainstream books the subject matter steered away from the happily ever after of romance and took on more complex and darker themes like adultery, drug addiction, and domestic violence. Since Live and Learn Bryant has written several mainstream novels that have showcased her diverse writing ability, including her bestselling Mistress series (Message from a Mistress, Mistress No More, Mistress, INC., The Pleasure Trap, and the upcoming Mistress for Hire). The Pleasure Trap was nominated for a 2014 RT Award for Best Multicultural Fiction.[5] In 2017 Message from a Mistress was made into a TV movie broadcast on Centric.[6]\\nIn 2008, Bryant teamed up with a fellow romance author to write the urban fiction Hoodwives series for Simon & Schuster/Touchstone.  Writing as Meesha Mink and De\\'Nesha Diamond, their first collaboration, Desperate Hoodwives, was released in January 2008, followed by Shameless Hoodwives in August 2008, and the highly anticipated The Hood Life in January 2009. The books have been featured in many national publications and have received critical praise for the writers\\' skill at storytelling and character development.  The New York Post listed Desperate Hoodwives as Required Reading and Essence magazine listed Shameless Hoodwives as one of their \"Top Ten Summer Sizzlers\" in 2008.[7] In 2011 she released her first solo project as Meesha Mink for Simon & Schuster/Touchstone, the \"Real Wifeys\" trilogy (Real Wifeys: On the Grind, Real Wifeys: Get Money, and Real Wifeys: Hustle Hard). Mink\\'s Kiss the Ring, the first book in the author\\'s on-going urban fiction/ mystery \"Queen\" series centered on a modern-day Foxy Brown-like character,[8] received rave reviews from Ebony Magazine,[9] The Library Journal,[10] and Publishers Weekly.[11] The second book, All Hail the Queen, was released February 2015. After a six-year hiatus, the third book, Street Queens, was released independently.\\nThe Meesha Mink website credits the author with saying:\\nThe stories about inner cities need to be as diverse as the people who live in these environments. Growing up on 16th Ave in Newark all my life, I knew in a one-block radius you could either have: a single mother or a married couple raising their family; dope dealers or people working forty hours a week; a homeowner or someone renting a low income apartment. For me, urban fiction isn\\'t about glorifying the negatives in the \\'hood, but simply telling the real stories that do exist. As a writer and a reader, I can always respect the gift of storytelling of ALL stories.Since her 2000 debut, Bryant\\'s books have consistently received top reviews; hit bestseller lists; been released as audiobook, book club and large print editions; and garnered award nominations/wins. Two of her books, \"Real Wifeys: On The Grind\" and \"Mistress No More\", simultaneously made the list of Black Expressions’ Best Books of 2011. Her books have appeared in many national publications including Ebony Magazine, Essence Magazine, The New York Post, Star Ledger, The Huffington Post, USA Today, Dallas Morning News, Upscale, Smooth Magazine, Juicy Magazine, The Library Journal, Publishers Weekly, Black Hair Magazine UK, and Parle Magazine.[12][13]\\nCurrently Bryant writes full-time and lives in South Carolina.[14]\\n',\n",

In 1965, the Cook sisters were honoured as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem in Israel.[3] In 2010 she was recognised as a British Hero of the Holocaust with her sister.\\nBetween 1936 and 1985, under the pen name Mary Burchell, Ida Cook wrote 112 romance novels for Mills & Boon — many of which were later republished by Harlequin. She helped to found the Romantic Novelists' Association, serving as its second president from 1966 to 1986.\\nIda Cook was born on 24 August 1904 in Sunderland, County Durham, England.[4] With her elder sister Louise (1901–1991), she attended The Duchess's School in Alnwick and later took civil service jobs in London. Both Ida and her sister, Louise, developed a passionate interest in opera.[5]\\nDuring the 1930s, as part of the work they undertook to help Jews to escape from the Nazi regime, the sisters visited Germany on multiple occasions, using their enthusiasm for opera as a cover for their frequent travel and smuggled Jewish people's jewellery and other valuables across the German border, thereby enabling Jews fleeing Germany to satisfy British financial security requirements for immigration.[2] They worked with Austrian conductor Clemens Krauss and his wife, the Romanian soprano Viorica Ursuleac, who had initially told them of the persecution of the Jews.[1] The sisters  enabled the escape of 29 Jews and others needing to flee from Nazi Germany, funded mainly by Ida's writing. The Cooks gave them an address to come to, a flat in Dolphin Square in Pimlico. Among those recued were Else Mayer-Lismann and her family.[6]\\nIn 1965 the Cook sisters were honoured as Righteous among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Authority in Israel. In 2010 the British Government named each of them a British Hero of the Holocaust.[7]\\nIn 1936 Ida published her first romance novels as Mary Burchell. During her career she wrote 112 romances for Mills & Boon, later re-edited by Harlequin Books, including the famous Warrender Saga, a series about the opera and concert-hall world. She incorporated many famous operas (Otello, Eugene Onegin and Carmen, among others) into the Warrender series plots. She wrote in the Romantic Novelists' Association's newsletter:[8]\\nI concede that a bad romantic novel is embarrassing and indefensible. So is a bad so-called realistic novel. And it is usually pretentious into the bargain, which is insufferable. But a good romantic novel is a heart-warming thing, which strikes a responsive chord in those who are happy and offers a certain lifting of the spirits to those who are not.In 1950 she published her autobiography, We Followed Our Stars.

Allen; Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Averil Ives, Anita Charles, Barbara Rowan, Jane Beaufort, Rose Burghley, Mary Whistler and Marguerite Bell. She has sold millions of copies over her 90-year career. She has been referred to as the \"world\\'s oldest novelist\" who was still active at 105 and continued writing until her death.[2] On the occasion of her 105th birthday, Pollock was appointed honorary vice-president of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association, having been one of its founding members.[3]\\nIda and her husband, Lt Colonel Hugh Alexander Pollock, DSO (1888–1971), a veteran of war and Winston Churchill\\'s collaborator and editor, had a daughter, Rosemary Pollock, who was also a romance writer. Ida\\'s autobiography, Starlight, published in 2009 at 100 years, tells the story of the start of her career, her marriage, and the relation of her husband with his ex-wife Enid Blyton. She was also an oil painter, who was selected for inclusion in a national exhibition in 2004, at the age of 96.[4]\\nBorn Ida Julia Crowe on 12 April 1908 in Lewisham, Kent, England,[5] she was the daughter of Fanny Osborn, whose father was an architect in Victorian London, and her husband Arthur Crowe, but Pollock claimed to be illegitimate.[6] Still unmarried, her mother began an affair with a supposed Russian duke, but, after her parents\\' death, her mother married Arthur Crowe, an old widower with a distant connection to Lord Nelson. A year or so later her mother resumed her affair with her Russian lover and became pregnant, but her daughter obtained her husband\\'s surname.[6] Her mother lived alone when Pollock was born, and she narrowly escaped being smothered with a pillow by the nurse who attended her birth.[7] Her mother had a difficult time raising her and she was almost adopted by a rich uncle.[6] Encouraged by her mother, she began to write while still at school. At 14, she published her first thriller, The Hills of Raven\\'s Haunt.[citation needed]\\nAt age 20, she was living with her mother in Hastings and already had several stories in major magazines and short novels in print.[8] She visited George Newnes\\'s office in London, to sell her first full-length manuscript;[7] Palanquins and Coloured Lanterns, a novel set in 1920s Shanghai.[8] Six months later, she discovered they had mislaid it.[9] After they found it, she returned to London to meet one of its editors, the 39-year-old Hugh Alexander Pollock (1888–1971), a distinguished veteran of World War I. Hugh had been married since 1924 to his second wife, the popular children\\'s writer Enid Blyton, and was divorced from his first wife, Marion Atkinson, with whom he had two sons, William Cecil Alexander (1914–16) and Edward Alistair (1915–69). George Newnes bought her manuscript and contracted with her to write two more novels.[7] She became a full-time writer in the 1930s, writing short stories under pseudonyms. Ida decided to travel alone to Morocco, after suffering a mental breakdown.[7]\\nDuring World War II, Ida worked at a hostel for girls in London during the Blitz; at this time Hugh, who had left publishing to join the Army, was Commandant of a school for Home Guard officers.[10] Hugh had two daughters with Enid Blyton, Gillian Mary (later Baverstock; 1931–2007) and Imogen Mary (later Smallwood; born 1935), but his marriage had difficulties and his wife began a series of affairs. He offered Ida a post as civilian secretary at the Army Training Centre in the Surrey Hills. During a bungled firearms training session on a firing range, Hugh was hit by shrapnel and Ida contacted Enid, who declined to visit her husband because she was busy and hated hospitals.[7]\\nIn 1941, Enid met Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters, a London surgeon with whom she began another relationship, and the marriage had broken down. In May 1942, while Ida was visiting her mother\\'s home in Hastings a bomb destroyed the house. She escaped unhurt, but her mother was in hospital for two weeks.[7] Hugh paid for Ida to stay at Claridges and he said he was divorcing his wife. To get a quick divorce, Hugh blamed himself for adultery at divorce petition. On 26 October 1943 Ida and Hugh were married at London\\'s Guildhall Register Office, six days after Enid\\'s marriage to Darrell Waters. In 1944 they had a daughter Rosemary Pollock who has also become a romance writer. Enid changed the names of their daughters and Hugh did not see them again, although Enid had promised access as part of his taking the blame for the divorce.[citation needed]\\nAfter World War II, George Newnes, Hugh\\'s old firm, decided not to work with him anymore. They also represented Enid Blyton and were not willing to let her go. After this the marriage experienced financial problems and, in 1950, Hugh had to declare bankruptcy while he struggled with alcoholism. Ida decided to write popular contemporary romances and sold her first novel to Mills & Boon in 1952. Being in print with several major international publishers at the same time, she decided to use multiple pseudonyms. In the 1950s she wrote as Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Rose Burghley, and Mary Whistler to Mills & Boon; as Averil Ives and Barbara Rowan to Ward Lock; as Anita Charles to Wright & Brown; and as Jane Beaufort to Collins. In 1964, she published under her married name, Ida Pollock, her first historical novel, The Gentle Masquerade, and after the success of it, Mills and Boon\\'s \"Masquerade\" series of historical romances was launched.[8] Under her last pseudonym, Marguerite Bell, she also wrote historical romances. Most of her novels have been reprinted by Mills & Boon (or Harlequin in the United States).\\nDuring her marriage she travelled widely and lived in many parts of England. It was their daughter\\'s asthma that brought the Pollocks to Cornwall. They also lived in Ireland, France, Italy, Malta and Switzerland, where they successfully obtained a lasting cure for Rosemary\\'s debilitating condition.[7] Hugh died on 8 November 1971 in Malta, where he is buried in the British military cemetery. After her husband\\'s death, Pollock returned with her daughter to England and they lived for several years in Wiltshire, before moving to Lanreath in 1986. In the 1970s she slowed the rhythm of publication, but continued to write. Besides romances, she published – as Barbara Rowan – a suspense novel, and her novel, A Distant Drum (2005), is based around the Battle of Waterloo. She has been referred to as the \"world\\'s oldest novelist\" who was still active at 105.[11] After her death, her medieval story: Sir Faintheart was published in 2015, and there are still at least two unpublished Regency romances pending publication, including The Runaway.[2]  Today many of her old novels are being reedited.\\nIn addition to writing, Ida constructed model houses, usually scale miniatures of Georgian or Tudor buildings. She was also an oil painter, who was selected for inclusion in a national exhibition in 2004, at the age of 96.[8] But her sight deteriorated and she returned to writing.\\nAfter her 100th birthday, her autobiography, Starlight, was published on 15 November 2009, and she tells the story of the start of her career, her marriage, and the relation of her husband with his ex-wife Enid Blyton.\\nIn 1960 she was a founding member of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association, and in 2010 she helped in its 50th anniversary.[7] On the occasion of her 105th birthday, she was appointed its honorary vice-president.\\nShe died 3 December 2013, aged 105.[12]\\n(* Novels reedited as Ida Pollock)\\n(* Novels reedited as Ida Pollock)\\n',\n",

She was a prolific writer who published several books a year in different literary genres, each genre under a different pen name: Jean Plaidy for fictionalized history of European royalty, Victoria Holt for gothic romances, and Philippa Carr for a multi-generational family saga. She also wrote light romances, crime novels, murder mysteries and thrillers under pseudonyms Eleanor Burford, Elbur Ford, Kathleen Kellow, Anna Percival, and Ellalice Tate.\\nIn 1989, the Romance Writers of America gave her the Golden Treasure award in recognition of her contributions to the romance genre.[1] By the time of her death, she had written more than 200 books that sold more than 100 million copies and had been translated into 20 languages.[2] She continues to be a widely borrowed author among British libraries.[3]\\n\"I consider myself extremely lucky to have been born and raised in London, and to have had on my doorstep this most fascinating of cities with so many relics of 2000 years of history still to be found in its streets.

There were old tennis-courts – the Tudor kind where Henry VIII was said to have played; and gardens filled with winter heather, jasmine and yellow chrysanthemums. [...] So that first night together was spent in the ancient bedroom with the tiny leaded paned windows, through which shafts of moonlight touched the room with a dreamlike radiance [...] \" —Eleanor Hibbert writing as Victoria Holt in The House of a Thousand Lanterns, 1974[5]\\nHibbert was born Eleanor Alice Burford on 1 September 1906 at 20 Burke Street, Canning Town, now part of the London borough of Newham.[6] She inherited a love of reading from her father, Joseph Burford, a dock labourer. Her mother was Alice Louise Burford, née Tate.\\nWhen she was quite young, bad health forced her to be privately educated at home. At the age of 16 she went to a business college, where she studied shorthand, typewriting, and languages. She then worked for a jeweller in Hatton Garden where she weighed gems and typed. She also worked as a language interpreter in a café for French and German-speaking tourists.[4]\\nIn her early twenties she married George Percival Hibbert (c. 1886–1966),[2][7] a wholesale leather merchant about twenty years older than herself, who shared her love of books and reading.[6] She was his second wife.[8] During World War II, the Hibberts lived in a cottage in Cornwall that looked out over a bay called Plaidy Beach.\\nBetween 1974 and 1978, Eleanor Hibbert bought a 13th-century manor house in Sandwich, Kent, that she named King\\'s Lodging because she believed that it had served previously as lodging for English monarchs Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.[7] The house had carved fireplaces and a staircase from the Tudor period.[9] Hibbert restored the house and furnished it opulently but soon found it too big for her taste and too far from London.[6]\\nShe then moved to a two-storey penthouse apartment at Albert Court, Kensington Gore, London, that overlooked the Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park.[4] She shared her apartment with Mrs. Molly Pascoe, a companion who also travelled with her.[10]\\nIn 1985, Hibbert sold King\\'s Lodging.[9][11]\\nHibbert spent her summers in her cottage near Plaidy Beach in Cornwall.[10] To get away from the cold English winter, Hibbert would sail around the world on board a cruise ship three months a year from January to April. The cruise would take her to exotic destinations like Egypt and Australia, locations that she later incorporated into her novels.[10][12] She sailed to Sydney aboard the cruise ship Oronsay in 1970, and the Canberra in 1978.[7]\\nTowards the end of her life, her eyesight started failing.[8]\\nEleanor Hibbert died on 18 January 1993 on the cruise ship Sea Princess somewhere between Athens, Greece and Port Said, Egypt and was buried at sea. A memorial service was later held on 6 March 1993, at St Peter\\'s Anglican Church, Kensington Park Road, London.[6]\\n\"When I was 14 and living in London, I\\'d go around Hampton Court Palace with its marvellous atmosphere, through the gateway where Anne Boleyn walked, the haunted gallery down which Katherine Howard ran.

She first discovered her fascination for the past when she visited Hampton Court in her teenage years.[14] After her marriage, Hibbert achieved the financial independence she needed to realise her desire to write. London\\'s monuments and royal personalities filled Hibbert\\'s historical novels. She was also influenced by her regular visits to British historic homes and their architecture.[15]\\n\"I\\'ll sit in a room and think \\'This is where Charles I was when he was on the run.\\' I feel the atmosphere all around me, and that\\'s what I write about.\" —Eleanor Hibbert[15]\\nDuring World War II, the Hibberts lived in Cornwall, whose pebble beaches, high cliffs and treacherous blue waters served as the setting for many of the Victoria Holt gothic novels.[16]\\nIn later life, Hibbert took a world cruise every year.[7] Her ship called in ports of countries like Turkey, Egypt, India, South Africa, Hong Kong, Ceylon and Australia. These exotic destinations serve as the backdrop in later Victoria Holt novels. In the late 1960s, Hibbert spent two months visiting the Australian goldfields 40 miles north of Melbourne, research for her 1971 Victoria Holt novel, The Shadow of the Lynx.[17] In 1972, Hibbert travelled from Sydney to Melbourne via the Snowy Mountains and visited Hobart, Launceston, Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo.[10][12]\\n\"I love my work so much that nothing would stop me writing. I never think of the money I\\'m making. When I finish one book I start on the next. If I take even a week\\'s break I just feel miserable. It\\'s like a drug. —Eleanor Hibbert[10]\\n\"If anybody says to me \\'you look tired,\\' it\\'s because I haven\\'t been able to get at my typewriter. Writing excites me. I live all my characters and never have any trouble thinking of plots of how people would have said something because I\\'m them when I\\'m writing. —Eleanor Hibbert[9]\\nHibbert\\'s Philippa Carr novels were based partly in Cornwall and partly in Australia.\\nHibbert was influenced in her writing by the Brontës (especially the novel Jane Eyre), George Eliot, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, and Leo Tolstoy.[4]\\nDuring the 1930s, Hibbert wrote nine long novels (each about 150,000 words in length), all of them serious psychological studies of contemporary life.[18] However, none of these were accepted for publication. At the same time, she wrote short stories for newspapers including the Daily Mail and Evening News. Some also appeared in The Star, Woman\\'s Realm and Ladies\\' Home Journal. The turning point came when the fiction editor of the Daily Mail told her, \"You\\'re barking up the wrong tree: you must write something which is saleable, and the easiest way is to write romantic fiction.\"\\nHibbert read 50 romance novels as research and then published her first fiction book, Daughter of Anna, in 1941.[19] It was a period novel set in Australia of the late 18th and 19th centuries. It was a moderate success and Hibbert received £30 as advance for it. The book was published under her maiden name, Eleanor Burford, which was also used for her contemporary novels. Following the success of the book, Hibbert was contracted by Herbert Jenkins publishers to write one book a year. By 1961 Hibbert had published 31 novels under this name, including ten romance novels for Mills & Boon.\\nIn 1945, she chose the pseudonym Jean Plaidy for her new novel Together They Ride at the request of her agent.[14] The name was inspired by Plaidy Beach near the Hibberts\\' home in Looe, Cornwall during World War II.[16] Her agent suggested the first name, saying \"Jean doesn\\'t take much room at the back of the book\".[14] The book was published by Gerald G. Swan, a London publisher.[4] The next book written under the Jean Plaidy pseudonym was Beyond the Blue Mountains in 1948. The publisher Robert Hale accepted the 500-page manuscript after it had been rejected by several others. The firm wrote to Hibbert\\'s literary agency, A.M. Heath, \"Will you tell this author that there are glittering prizes ahead for those who can write as she does?\".[8] In 1949, Hibbert hit her stride with the first Jean Plaidy novel that fictionalized stories of royalty: The King\\'s Pleasure, featuring Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.[20] A total of 91 Jean Plaidy novels were published. Hibbert\\'s last Jean Plaidy book, The Rose Without a Thorn, was published posthumously.[4]\\nHibbert also wrote four non-fiction books under the pseudonym Jean Plaidy. The first, A Triptych of Poisoners (1958), was a collection of short biographies of poisoners: Cesare Borgia, Marie d\\'Aubray and Edward William Pritchard. The other three were a trilogy on the Spanish Inquisition: The Rise (1959), The Growth (1960) and The End (1961).\\nFrom 1950 to 1953, Hibbert wrote four novels as Elbur Ford, a pen name derived from her maiden name, Eleanor Burford. These novels were based on real-life murderers of the nineteenth century:  Edward William Pritchard (Flesh and the Devil, 1950); Adelaide Bartlett (Poison in Pimlico, 1950); Euphrasie Mercier[21] (The Bed Disturbed, 1952) and Constance Kent (Such Bitter Business, 1953 – published in the U.S. in 1954 under the title Evil in the House).\\nBetween 1952 and 1960, Hibbert used the pseudonym Kathleen Kellow to write eight novels that were mostly crime and mystery fiction. From 1956 to 1961, she wrote five novels as Ellalice Tate, a pseudonym inspired by her mother\\'s name, Alice Tate.[22]\\n\"I\\'ve always wanted to write a best-seller. Every writer does. It\\'s really a matter of finding out what the public wants. —Eleanor Hibbert[18]\\nIn 1960, at the suggestion of her agent, Patricia Schartle Myrer, she wrote her first Gothic romance, Mistress of Mellyn, under the name Victoria Holt. The pseudonym was created by choosing the name Victoria for its regal, romantic ring while the name Holt was taken from the military bank of Holt & Company where Hibbert had an account.[18][23] Published by Doubleday in the United States and Collins in the United Kingdom, Mistress of Mellyn became an instant international bestseller and revived the Gothic romantic suspense genre.[2][8][24][25]\\n\"I have heard her name mentioned in connection with mine and I think it is because we both lived in Cornwall and have written about this place. Rebecca is the atmospheric suspense type of book mine are. But I don’t think there is much similarity between her others and mine.\" —Daphne du Maurier commenting on the similarity between Victoria Holt\\'s novels and her own.[9]\\nMistress of Mellyn was a clever weaving of elements from earlier Gothic novels such as Jane Eyre (1847), The Woman in White (1859), and Rebecca (1938). Its setting in Cornwall made the resemblance to Rebecca (1938) so remarkable that it was speculated that Victoria Holt was a pseudonym for Daphne du Maurier.[15][26] After six Victoria Holt novels were published over eight years, it was revealed that Hibbert was the author.[9] Hibbert wrote a further 31 novels as Victoria Holt, primarily portraying fictitious characters set against an authentic period background, usually of the late 19th century. The last Victoria Holt novel, The Black Opal, was published after her death.[8]\\nIn 1960, Hibbert wrote a novel under the name Anna Percival, a pseudonym inspired by her husband\\'s middle name, Percival. Hibbert never used that pen name again.\\nShe created her last pseudonym, Philippa Carr, in 1972 at the suggestion of her publisher, Collins, to create a new series showing successive generations of English gentlewomen involved in important historical events starting with the Reformation and ending with World War II.[8]\\nHibbert continued to use the pseudonym Jean Plaidy for her historical novels about the crowned heads of Europe. Her books written under this pseudonym were popular with the general public and were also hailed by critics and historians for their historical accuracy, quality of writing, and attention to detail.[27]\\nNumber of books written per decade under different pseudonyms\\nHibbert based her research on the writings of British historians such as John Speed, James Anthony Froude, Alexander Fraser Tytler and Agnes Strickland.[4]\\nEach of Hibbert\\'s Jean Plaidy books featured a bibliography at the end, listing the historical works consulted during the process of writing the book.[28]\\nThe Kensington Central Library gave Hibbert special concessions to aid her research. She was allowed to go down to the vault where the out-of-circulation books were stored, and borrow them a trolley-load at a time.[10] She was even allowed to take the books home and keep them as long as she wanted.[9]\\nWhen her eyesight started failing towards the end of her life, she borrowed audiobooks from the Westminster City Council public libraries.[8]\\nHibbert was a prolific writer, churning out multiple books in a year under different pseudonyms, chiefly Jean Plaidy, Victoria Holt and Philippa Carr.[29][30] Jean Plaidy proved very popular in the United Kingdom, selling large quantities in paperback while Victoria Holt was a bestseller in the United States. Many of her readers never realized that behind all these pen names was a single author.[31][32][33]\\nHibbert attributed her large output to her regular working habits. She described herself as a compulsive writer and would write all seven days in the week. She started every morning at the typewriter on her desk, usually completing five thousand words by lunchtime.[19] Though writing stimulated her, she found the typewriter to be a physical strain. She devoted five hours every day to her writing, in addition to the time that it took her to proof-read her draft and conduct research. In the afternoon, she would personally answer all the fan mail she received. She would also spend time at Kensington Central Library. In the evening, she played chess if she could find an opponent or attended social engagements.[14]\\nEven while on her annual cruise around the world, Hibbert maintained her discipline. She wrote in the mornings, played chess in the afternoons, and joined in the shipboard entertainments in the evenings. She preferred to work on her Victoria Holt novels while on board the cruise ship because they did not require as much research or fact-checking at a library.[12]\\nEleanor Hibbert enjoyed healthy, lifelong relationships with her literary agents and publishers, a rare feat in the publishing world.[8] She was represented in the United Kingdom by A.M. Heath Literary Agency and by McIntosh & Otis in the United States. Her long-time American agent was Patricia Schartle Myrer followed by Julie Fallowfield.\\nLondon publisher Herbert Jenkins published 20 light romantic novels from 1941 to 1955 that Hibbert wrote under the pen name Eleanor Burford. The contract, initially for one book a year at an advance of £30 a title, was later revised to two books a year when the books proved successful.[4]\\nMills and Boon, a London publisher that specialised in low-priced, paperback, romantic novels brought out 10 romance novels from 1956 to 1962 that Hibbert wrote under the pen name Eleanor Burford.\\nGerald G Swan published the first Jean Plaidy book in 1945 but every one after that was published by Robert Hale. Starting with Beyond the Blue Mountains (1948) and extending over the entire course of her lifetime, Robert Hale published a total of 90 Jean Plaidy books in hardcover with dust jackets illustrated by specialist artist Philip Gough.[4]\\nMacRae Smith Co. of Philadelphia published Jean Plaidy titles in the United States. Foreign language editions of Jean Plaidy books began appearing in 1956: in French by Éditions Robert Laffont, Paris; in Spanish by Guillermo Kraft Limitada, Buenos Aires; and in Dutch by Uitgeverij A.J. Luitingh, Amsterdam.\\nIn 1951, Canadian paperback publishers Harlequin reprinted Jean Plaidy\\'s Beyond the Blue Mountains in paperback to achieve their greatest commercial success to that date: of the 30,000 copies sold, only 48 were returned.[34]\\nRobert Hale published eight Kathleen Kellow crime and mystery novels between 1952 and 1960 in hardcover with dust jackets by Philip Gough. Robert Hale also published the sole book written under the Anna Percival pseudonym, The Brides of Lanlory.[4]\\nFrom 1950 to 1953, four Elbur Ford crime novels were published by London publisher William Morrow in the United Kingdom and New York publisher Werner Laurie in the United States.\\nFrom 1956 to 1961, Hodder & Stoughton published all five historical novels written under the pseudonym Ellalice Tate.[4]\\nFrom 1960 to 1993, Hibbert wrote 32 Victoria Holt novels for the publishing giants Collins in the United Kingdom and Doubleday in the United States. Many of them were bestsellers and were translated into 20 languages to reach a worldwide audience.\\nFrom 1972 to 1993, Hibbert wrote 19 Philippa Carr novels that were published by Collins in the United Kingdom and Putnam in the United States. A few of them were later translated into foreign languages such as Spanish, Finnish, Russian and Polish.\\nBy the time of her death in 1993, Hibbert had sold 75 million books translated in 20 languages under the name Victoria Holt, 14 million under the name Jean Plaidy and 3 million under the name Philippa Carr.[2][35]\\nAfter her death, Mark Hamilton of the A.M. Heath Literary Agency took over as executor for her literary estate, estimated to be worth about £8,790,807 at probate.[6][36]\\nThe book The Love Child published in 1950 by Eleanor Burford must not be mistaken for the same-titled novel by Philippa Carr published in 1978 as part of the Daughters of England Series.[37]\\nMany Jean Plaidy books were published under different titles in the United States. Her trilogies were also later re-published as single books, often under different titles than those shown.\\nJean Plaidy historical novels were welcomed by readers who found them to be an easy way to gain insight into a sweeping panorama of European history.\\nIt was common for school girls in England to read these in history lessons, whilst hiding them behind their proper text books.\\nIn the last decade of the 20th century, historical fiction went out of fashion. Jean Plaidy titles went out of print.\\nIn October 2001, Rachel Kahan, associate editor at Crown Publishing Group, and Jean Plaidy fan since childhood, discovered that Jean Plaidy books had gone out of print in the United States.\\n\"I felt awful – like when you learn that an old friend who you haven\\'t seen for many years has suddenly died. But in this case, I was not just a fan mourning the loss of all those great novels, I was actually in a position to do something about it.\" —Rachel Kahan, on discovering in 2003 that Jean Plaidy books had gone out of print in the United States.[20]\\nKahan bought the reprint rights to ten Jean Plaidy novels. In April 2003, Crown chose to publish two books under the Three Rivers Press imprint, both featuring Henry VIII. The Lady in the Tower and The Rose Without a Thorn tell the story of two of his six wives, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, both of whom were beheaded. The books were published in paperback with new titles, modern covers and a readers\\' guide at the back. The first printing of 30,000 copies of each book sold out in 3 months. Based on this success, Crown\\'s United Kingdom unit, Arrow Books, bought the entire Jean Plaidy backlist.[38]\\nIn the Spring of 2003 Three Rivers Press, an imprint of U.S.A. publisher Crown Publishing Group, started republishing Jean Plaidy\\'s stories.[39][40] Three Rivers Press published some of the books with new titles which are listed here:\\nSome of these novels were re-published under the Jean Plaidy name.\\nAll these novels were later re-published under the Jean Plaidy name.\\nVictoria Holt books proved popular with the reading public and many of them made it to bestseller lists. Hibbert won loyalty from large numbers of women readers who passed along their copies to the next generation of women in their family. Hibbert described her heroines as \"women of integrity and strong character\" who were \"struggling for liberation, fighting for their own survival.\"\\n\"A Victoria Holt book is the sort of story to bring despair to literary critics, and rage to supporters of Women\\'s Lib though it would give a great deal of pleasurable entertainment to vast numbers of ordinary women all over the world.\" – a critic[13]\\nHer 1960 novel Mistress of Mellyn single-handedly revived the Gothic romance genre.[15] Many women started writing their own gothic romances. Even male authors like Tom E. Huff and Julian Fellowes succumbed to the trend and wrote romances under female pseudonyms.[42][43][44][45]\\nVictoria Holt novels became best-sellers. In 1970, when gothic mania was at its peak, The Secret Woman became one of the top 10 best-selling books in the United States.[46] By 1975, a Victoria Holt paperback began with a first printing of 800,000 copies.[47]\\nBy the early 1970s gothic novels outsold all other genres in paperback fiction, including mysteries, science fiction and Westerns. This coincided with consolidation within the publishing industry where paperbacks and hardcover publishers were brought together under the same corporate parent for the first time. More sophisticated marketing efforts led to placement in grocery and drugstore checkout aisles, where they found their target audience: educated, middle-class women with a reading habit.[48]\\nHibbert\\'s romance novels were clean; at the most the main characters exchanged smouldering looks of longing. However, by 1969 the sexual revolution had made explicit description more acceptable. In April 1972, the romance novel The Flame and the Flower took advantage of this change in trend and revolutionized the historical romance genre by detailing physical intimacy between the protagonists. Another such novel, Sweet Savage Love, that followed in 1974 cemented the trend. A new genre was thus born, dubbed the \\'sweet savage romance\\' or the \\'bodice ripper\\' because of the heaving, partly exposed bosom often pictured on the cover.[49][50]\\nInterest in Hibbert\\'s clean romances declined. In 1976, a critic complained that Victoria Holt\\'s heroines \"must be a little bit dumb or they won\\'t get themselves into such improbable messes in the first place.\"[51] The next Victoria Holt novel, The Devil on Horseback (1977), was described as \"from another era, sort of out of step with today\\'s style.\"[52] Critics judged the books as falling \"short of her previous standards.\"[53]\\n\"Today\\'s novels are \\'bodice rippers\\' and about as pure as driven slush.\" – a book critic in 1982[54]\\n\"In these books, innocent young virgins are carried off unwillingly by sensual, often primitive older men to picturesque lairs: by pirates to their galleons, Arabs to their harems, Indians to their tepees, knights to their castles. Early in the plot, the woman is ravished against her will and there is sex throughout the story.\" – a book critic describing the \\'bodice-ripper\\' type of romance novel in 1985[55]\\nBy the early 1980s, Gothic romances were no longer as popular as a decade earlier. Readers demanded more sex and adventure in their romance novels. Publishers created paperback imprints like Silhouette and Candlelight Ecstasy simply to satisfy the enormous demand for \"bodice rippers\" and \"hot historicals\".[54][56]\\nBowing to the changing times, Hibbert wrote The Demon Lover, a 1982 Victoria Holt novel, in a style that borrowed several elements from the plot of Sweet Savage Love: forced seduction of a naive girl by a powerful man ending in marriage, set against a background of turmoil in war time. Critics congratulated the move: \"Her latest, \\'The Demon Lover\\', is a straight romance with sexual passion, which is currently \\'in\\'. It has no suspense: the thrilling twists and turns of plot that marked her Gothic novels are no more.\"[57]\\nVictoria Holt\\'s heroines left the decorous drawing rooms of Victorian England to find adventure in far more exotic locations: inside an Egyptian pyramid (The Curse of the Kings, 1973); among Chinese antiques in Hong Kong (The House of a Thousand Lanterns, 1974);[58] down the opal mines of Australia (The Pride of the Peacock, 1976); on a tea plantation in Ceylon (The Spring of the Tiger, 1979);[59] among lush, tropical islands off the coast of Australia (The Road to Paradise Island, 1985);[60] in Crimea with Florence Nightingale (Secret for a Nightingale, 1986); in mutiny-filled British India (The India Fan, 1988); in a Turkish nobleman\\'s harem in Constantinople (The Captive, 1989);[61] in the British colonies of South Africa (Snare of Serpents, 1990); and on a shipwreck in the South Sea Islands (The Black Opal, 1993).\\nIn 1993, Hibbert died. In the closing years of the 20th century, Victoria Holt titles were made available in large print, audiobook and Braille formats. Translations in several European languages, Russian, Hebrew, Persian, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese also appeared.\\n\"Never regret. If it\\'s good, it\\'s wonderful. If it\\'s bad, it\\'s experience.\" —Eleanor Hibbert writing as Victoria Holt in The Black Opal, 1993.[62]\\nIn 2006, London publisher Harper reprinted four of Victoria Holt\\'s most popular titles with new covers: Mistress of Mellyn (1961), The Shivering Sands (1969), The Shadow of the Lynx (1971) and The Time of the Hunter\\'s Moon (1983). Foreign language translations in European languages, Japanese, Sinhalese and Thai were also published that year.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n Sir Thomas Henry Hall Caine CH KBE (14 May 1853 – 31 August 1931),[1] usually known as Hall Caine, was a British novelist, dramatist, short\\nstory writer, poet and critic of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Caine\\'s popularity during his lifetime was unprecedented. He wrote fifteen novels on subjects of adultery, divorce, domestic violence, illegitimacy, infanticide, religious bigotry and women\\'s rights, became an international literary celebrity, and sold a total of ten million books. Caine was the most highly paid novelist of his day. The Eternal City is the first novel to have sold over a million copies worldwide.[2] In addition to his books, Caine is the author of more than a dozen plays and was one of the most commercially successful dramatists of his time; many were West End and Broadway productions. Caine adapted seven of his novels for the stage. He collaborated with leading actors and managers, including Wilson Barrett, Viola Allen, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Louis Napoleon Parker, Mrs Patrick Campbell, George Alexander, and Arthur Collins. Most of Caine\\'s novels were adapted into silent black and white films. A. E. Coleby\\'s 1923 18,454 feet, nineteen-reel film The Prodigal Son became the longest commercially made British film.[3] Alfred Hitchcock\\'s 1929 film The Manxman, is Hitchcock\\'s last silent film.\\nBorn in Runcorn to a Manx father and Cumbrian mother, Caine was raised in Liverpool. After spending four years in school, Caine was trained as an architectural draughtsman. While growing up he spent childhood holidays with relatives in the Isle of Man. At seventeen he spent a year there as schoolmaster in Maughold. Afterwards he returned to Liverpool and began a career in journalism, becoming a leader-writer on the Liverpool Mercury. As a lecturer and theatre critic he developed a circle of eminent literary friends by whom he was influenced. Caine moved to London at Dante Gabriel Rossetti\\'s suggestion and lived with the poet, acting as secretary and companion during the last years of Rossetti\\'s life.  Following the publication of his Recollections of Rossetti in 1882 Caine began his career as a writer spanning four decades.\\nCaine established his residency in the Isle of Man in 1895, where he sat from 1901 to 1908 in the Manx House of Keys, the lower house of its legislature. Caine was elected President of the Manx National Reform League in 1903 and chair of the Keys\\' Committee that prepared the 1907 petition for constitutional reform. In 1929\\nCaine was granted the Freedom of the Borough of Douglas, Isle of Man. Caine visited Russia in 1892 on behalf of the persecuted Jews. In 1895 Caine travelled in the United States and Canada, where he represented the Society of Authors conducting successful negotiations and obtaining important international copyright concessions from the Dominion Parliament.\\nDuring the Great War (1914–1918) Caine wrote many patriotic articles and edited King Albert\\'s Book, the proceeds of which went to help Belgian refugees. In 1917, Caine was created an Officer of the Order of Leopold by King Albert I of Belgium. Caine cancelled many literary contracts in America to devote all his time and energy to the British war effort. On the recommendation of the Prime Minister Lloyd George for services as an Allied propagandist in the United States, King George V made him a Knight of the British Empire in 1918 and a Companion of Honour in 1922. Aged 78 Caine died in his home at Greeba Castle on the Isle of Man.\\nThomas Henry Hall Caine was born on 14 May 1853 at 29 Bridgewater Street, Runcorn, Cheshire, England,[4][nb 1] the eldest of six children of John Caine (1825–1904) and his wife Sarah Caine (née Hall, (1828–1912)). Sarah was born in Whitehaven, Cumberland, and descended from an old Quaker family of Ralph Halls, china manufacturer.[5][6][7] After living for many years in Cumberland the Hall family moved to Liverpool where Sarah, a seamstress, met and married John. As her husband was a member of the Anglican Church and not a Quaker she lost her connection with the Society of Friends. Throughout her life she retained the Quaker simplicity of life and dress.[8] John Caine, a blacksmith, came from the Isle of Man. In the absence of work he emigrated to Liverpool, where he trained as a shipsmith. At the time of Caine\\'s birth, he was working temporarily in Runcorn docks. Within a few months the family were back in Liverpool, where Caine spent his childhood and youth. They rented rooms at 14 Rhyl Street, Toxteth, convenient for Liverpool Docks and within a small Manx expat community. By 1858 they had moved to number 21.  Early in 1862 they moved to 5 Brougham Street where Caine attended Windsor Street Wesleyan School, and in January 1865 the family moved round the corner to 2 Coburg Street.[9][nb 2]\\nDuring his childhood Caine was occasionally sent to stay with his grandmother, Isabella, and uncle, William, a butcher-farmer, in their thatched cottage at Ballaugh on the Isle of Man.[10][11] His grandmother nicknamed him \\'Hommy-Beg\\', Manx for \\'Little Tommy\\'.[12] The island has a long history of folklore and superstition, passed from generation to generation.[13] Continuing this tradition Grandmother Caine passed on her knowledge of local myths and legends to her grandson, telling him countless stories of fairies, witches, witch-doctors and the evil eye while they were sat by the fire.[14]\\nWhen Caine was nine he lost two of his young sisters within a year. Five year old Sarah developed hydrocephaly after a fever. Fourteen month old Emma died in convulsions brought on by whooping cough she caught from him and his brother John. Caine was to be sent to the Isle of Man to recover from his illness and grief. He was put on a boat to Ramsey by his father, with a label pinned on his coat and assurances that his uncle would meet him. A fierce storm occurred preventing the ferry from reaching land. Caine was rescued by a large rowing boat. He later drew on this experience when writing the scene in The Bondman in which Stephen Orry is cast ashore there.[15] Another sister, Lily Hall Caine, made it to adulthood and became a prominent stage actress. Lily died June 1, 1914.[16]\\nThe Caine family belonged to the Baptist Church in Myrtle Street, Liverpool, presided over by the charismatic Hugh Stowell Brown, a Manxman and brother of poet Thomas Edward Brown. Brown\\'s public lectures and work among the poor made him a household name in Liverpool. Caine participated in the literary and debating society Brown had established. While Caine was very young he became well known and highly regarded by the people of south Liverpool. There he was in great demand as a speaker, having the ability to engage an audience from his first word.[17] Through studying the works of the Lake School of Poets, and the best writers of the eighteenth century, Caine combined this knowledge with his own ideas of perfection, and went on to develop his level of eloquence to oratory.[18]\\nFrom the age of ten Caine was educated at Hope Street Unitarian Higher Grade School in Caledonia Street, Liverpool, becoming head boy in his last year there.[19][20][21] Prior to this he attended St. James\\'s School and for several years afterwards continued his education attending evening classes at Queen\\'s College, Liverpool Institute.[22] He spent many hours on his own avidly reading books, notably at Liverpool\\'s Free Library.[23] Caine also experienced what he described as the \\'scribbling itch\\' for writing. He produced essays, poems, novels and overview histories with little thought of them being published.[24]\\nIn common with all 19th century towns Liverpool was unsanitary. In 1832 there had been a cholera epidemic. As panic and fear of this new and misunderstood disease spread, eight major riots had broken out on the streets along with several smaller uprisings.[25] In 1849 a second epidemic occurred.[26] When Caine was thirteen the third outbreak of cholera occurred in July 1866.[27] Memories of that time were to stay with him, the deaths, the large volume of funerals and prayer meetings in open spaces that were happening all around him.[28]\\nAt fifteen, after leaving school, he was apprenticed to John Murray, an architect and surveyor in Lord Street, Liverpool.[29] Murray was a distant relative of William Ewart Gladstone.[29] On 10 December 1868, the day of the general election when Gladstone was to be elected as Prime Minister, Caine was running to offices in Union Court, belonging to Gladstone\\'s brother, with telegrams announcing the results of the contests all over the country. Caine was breaking the news of great majorities before Gladstone had time to open his telegrams.[30] Caine was to meet Gladstone on another occasion when he was on Gladstone\\'s estate at Seaforth House. The surveyor-in-chief had not appeared one morning and a fifteen year old Caine took his place.[31] Caine had left a lasting impression on Gladstone, as two years later Caine had a letter from Gladstone\\'s brother saying the Prime Minister wished to appoint him steward of the Lancashire Gladstone estates. Caine declined the offer.[32]\\nCaine\\'s maternal grandparents had lived with the rest of his family while they were growing up in Liverpool. His grandfather, Ralph Hall, died in January 1870, when Caine was seventeen.  In the same year of his life Caine was reunited with William Tirebuck, a friend from his school days, when the business of their masters brought them together. United in their interest in literature, they made a juvenile attempt to establish a monthly manuscript magazine, assisted by Tirebuck\\'s sister. Tirebuck was editor, printer, publisher and postman; Caine was principal author.  One of the magazine\\'s contributors inherited a small fortune which he invested. About ten thousand copies were printed, followed by a delayed issue no.2. After this venture Tirebuck returned to his position as junior clerk in a merchant\\'s office.[33][34]\\nSuffering from what he described as \"the first hint of one of the nervous attacks which even then beset me\", and later as \"the first serious manifestation of the nervous attacks which have pursued me through my life\",[35] Caine quit his job with Murray and, arriving unannounced, went to live with his uncle and aunt, James and Catherine Teare in Maughold on the Isle of Man.\\nTeare was the local schoolmaster, and as Caine was to learn, ill with tuberculosis.  Caine became his assistant teaching in the schoolhouse. Finding their accommodation in part of the schoolhouse was crowded Caine camped in a nearby tholtan, a half-ruined cottage.  Using his stonemason skills, taught to him by his grandfather Hall, he restored and lived in the cottage.  On the stone lintel above the door he carved the name Phoenix Cottage and the date 8 January 1871.[36][37]\\nEncouraged by Teare, after he had written to reassure Caine\\'s parents that he might one day be able to make a living as a writer, Caine wrote anonymous articles for a local newspaper on a wide range of religious and economic questions.[37]\\nJohn Ruskin had started his Guild of St George and began expressing his ideas in his new monthly series, Fors Clavigera, written as a result of his feelings regarding the acute poverty and misery in Great Britain at the time. Rumours of undergraduates, following Ruskin\\'s ideas, digging the ground outside Oxford, reached Caine. He was inspired by Ruskin to begin writing denunciations of the social system and of the accepted interpretation of the Christian faith.[38] Caine was to become \\'an eager pupil and admirer\\' of Ruskin.[28] He later became a frequent visitor to Ruskin\\'s Coniston home, Brantwood.\\nFollowing the death of James Teare in December 1871, Caine carved a headstone for the grave.  After officially taking his place as schoolmaster, he also performed the extra unpaid services his uncle had provided, \"such as the making of wills for farmers round about, the drafting of agreement and leases, the writing of messages to banks protesting against crushing interest, and occasionally the inditing of love letters for young farm hands to their girls in service on farms that were far away\". Later he drew on this material to use in his writing.[39]\\nIn March 1872, he had a letter from Murray his master, the architect, which said \"Why are you wasting your life over there? Come back to your proper work at once.\" Caine was on his way back to Liverpool within a week.[40][41]\\nIn April 1872, at the age of eighteen, Caine was back home in Liverpool where he set about applying his knowledge, gained working in the drawing office, into articles on architectural subjects, and subsequently published in The Builder and The Building News. These were Caine\\'s first works published for a national audience. The articles caught Ruskin\\'s attention and he wrote words of encouragement to Caine.[42]\\nSeeking to be published, he offered his services, without payment, as a theatre critic to a number of Liverpool newspapers, which were accepted. He used the pseudonym \\'Julian\\'.[43] Before Henry Irving played Hamlet, his intention to play the part differently to any other actor was known to Caine and he contributed many articles on the subject to various papers.[44] The study of Shakespeare and the Bible from his earliest years were his \\'chief mental food\\'.[45] As he had become more absorbed by literary studies he was not content with reading Shakespeare\\'s plays, so he was reading all of the most notable playwrights of the Elizabethan age and \"he began to make acquaintance with the dramatists\".[45] In the summer of 1872 Caine wrote his first play.  The Charter was an adaptation of Charles Kingsley\\'s novel Alton Locke, but as an unknown writer he could not get it staged.[46]  \"Partly from the failure of faith in myself as a draughtsman and partly from a desire to be moving on\"[47] Caine left his employment with Murray and joined the office of Richard Owen and later Wainwright and Son. For a few years he was general assistant to a builder, James Bromley who became his friend.[48]\\nTogether with William Tirebuck and George Rose, his friends from school days,[49] Caine applied himself to establishing Liverpool branches of the Shakespeare Society, and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings.[50] They called their own organisation Notes and Queries Society and held their meetings at the prominent Royal Institution, Colquitt Street. Caine was president of the society and their meetings were reported in the Liverpool newspapers.[51] The \\'Notes\\' were often provided by John Ruskin, William Morris and Dante Gabriel Rossetti.[52]\\nOn 16 October 1874 Henry Irving wrote to Caine agreeing to his request to use his portrait in Stray Leaves a new monthly magazine he was launching.[53][54] In his capacity as critic of the Liverpool Town Crier, Caine attended the first night of Hamlet at the Lyceum Theatre, London, on 31 October 1874, with Irving in the title role. Caine was enthralled by Irving\\'s performance and after his enthusiastic review was published in the newspaper, he was asked to reprint it as a broad-sheet pamphlet, as it was of such a high quality.[53]\\nCaine\\'s first short story Max Wieland was published in the Liverpool Critic around 1874. A year later Caine became dramatic critic of the Spectator.[55] Caine\\'s long narrative poem, Geraldine, appeared in print in March 1876. It was a completion of Coleridge\\'s unfinished poem Christabel.[54][56]\\nThe Caine family had moved into a larger house in 1873, at 59 South Chester Street, Toxteth, where Caine shared a bedroom with his younger brother John, a shipping clerk.[57] John contracted tuberculosis which he passed to his brother. By 1875 Caine had permanent lodgings in New Brighton, spending weekends there \"for the sake of his health\".[58] Caine became increasingly unwell from the beginning of January 1877. In April the same year John, died from tuberculosis, aged 21. Dangerously ill, Caine was terrified of suffering the same fate.[59] He recovered, but the disease left him with permanent lung damage, and throughout his life he had attacks of bronchitis. In his 1913 novel The Woman Thou Gavest Me, he describes Mary O’Neil dying of tuberculosis.[60]\\nManchester Corporation had covertly been buying land for building the proposed Thirlmere Aqueduct, intended to supply water to the city. When discovered, it outraged the local community. Thirlmere, close to the centre of the Lake District, in an area, not only celebrated in the poetry of early conservationist William Wordsworth and fellow Lake poets, but also used as a summer residence by writers, amongst others.[61] In opposition to damming the lake at Thirlmere to form a reservoir, the first environmental group, Thirlmere Defence Association was formed in 1877.[62] It was supported by the national press, Wordsworth\\'s son and John Ruskin. Caine, incensed at what he perceived as a threat to his beloved Cumbria, joined the movement, initiating a Parliamentary petition.[63] Thirlmere was to be the setting for his novel The Shadow of a Crime.[63]\\nIn response to his lecture The Supernatural in Shakespeare,[64] given in July 1878, in a meeting chaired by Professor Edward Dowden, Matthew Arnold wrote him a long letter of praise. He was also praised by Keats\\'s biographer, Lord Houghton.[65] The lecture appeared in Colburn\\'s New Monthly Magazine in August 1879,[66]\\nIrving presided at a meeting of the Liverpool Notes and Queries Society in September 1878.  At Irving\\'s invitation, he travelled to London to attend Irving\\'s first night at the Lyceum Theatre under his own management, presenting his new production of Hamlet with Ellen Terry as Ophelia on 30 December. It was at this time that Caine was introduced to Irving\\'s business manager, Bram Stoker, who was to become one of his closest friends.[67] Stoker was subsequently to dedicate his famous novel Dracula to Caine, under the nickname \\'Hommy-Beg\\'.\\nIn 1879 Caine edited a booklet of the papers presented to the Notes and Queries Society by William Morris, Samuel Huggins and John J. Stevenson on the progress of public and professional thought on the treatment of ancient buildings which was described as \"\\'well worth reading\".[68][69] At the 1879 Social Science Congress held in Manchester Town Hall, Caine read his paper A New Phase of the Question of Architectural Restoration. He spoke of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, its purpose, actions and achievements.[70] Caine had joined the society the previous year and remained a member for the rest of his life. One of the society\\'s founders was William Morris.\\nAs a young man of 21 Caine encountered the self-proclaimed \\'Great American Doctor\\', Francis Tumblety, aged 43, after he set up at 177 Duke Street, Liverpool, offering herbal cure-all elixirs and Patent medicines to the public, which he claimed were secrets of the American Indians.  Tumblety posed at various times in his life as a surgeon, an officer in the federal army, and a gentleman.[71] He always followed his name with \"M.D.\" and used the title \\'Doctor\\', without the supporting qualifications for which he was fined in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1860.[72]\\nFrom September 1874, Tumblety was announcing his arrival in Liverpool by advertising in local newspapers, later including testimonials.[73] Following the death of Edward Hanratty in January 1875, the same night he took a spoon of medicine supplied by Tumblety, and action taken by William Carroll to sue Tumblety for £200 after allegedly publishing a false testimonial, Tumblety fled to London.[74] Many newspapers reported the stories and in the wake of this adverse publicity, Tumblety recruited Caine to edit his biography.  Late January Tumblety wrote requesting Caine to obtain a quote for printing ten thousand copies in Liverpool, telling of being betrayed by a supposed friend, and praising Caine for his genuine friendship.[75][76] After Caine forwarded his letters, he wrote on 1 February discussing the upcoming biography and enclosed a letter supposedly originating from the Isle of Wight, by Napoleon III.[77] The following day the first advert for the upcoming pamphlet appeared in the Liverpool Mercury.[76] Tumblety changed lodgings, initially missing an urgent telegram from Caine indicating there was a problem with the publication.  His response was to tell Caine to stop until he saw the proofs.  Tumblety offered to pay for Caine to visit him in London to discuss the pamphlet, his letter dated 16 February indicating Caine had taken up the offer.[78] He told a friend that his visit to Tumblety was \"arduous\".[41] A spate of correspondence relating to the publication ensued, Tumblety supplying Caine with names of notable people to be included in the pamphlet, along with money for printing and advertising.  Tumblety later wrote of disputes with the printer.  Claiming to be too ill to send money, he sent Caine a printer\\'s bill for payment. Tumblety had hired an assistant who read the proofs to him.  The pamphlet entitled Passages from the Life of Dr Francis Tumblety, and the fourth of Tumblety\\'s biographies, was published in March 1875.[75]\\nTumblety wrote to Caine in April 1875 that he was contemplating manufacturing his pills in London, and required a partner to share the profits, telling Caine to approach Liverpool chemists as proposed outlets.[79] Caine had declined a further invitation to London, but Tumblety persisted with his invites to join him in London, later made by telegram, additionally inviting him on a planned trip to America.[80] Around the time Alfred Thomas Heap was hanged in Kirkdale Gaol, Liverpool, for an abortion-related death, Tumblety, who had been arrested in 1857 for selling abortion drugs, disappeared. Caine made enquiries as to his whereabouts.[81][82] Briefly Tumblety set up offices in Union Passage, Birmingham. His correspondence turned menacing, demanding money from Caine.[83] Tumblety left London for New York City in August 1876.  Failing to entice Caine to join him, he followed months later with a pleading letter from San Francisco, after which there is no record of any further contact.[84][85]\\nCaine delivered a series of three lectures on Dante Gabriel Rossetti\\'s work and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood movement at Liverpool Library between November 1878 and March 1879. The January lecture entitled The Poetry of Dante Rossetti was printed in Colburn\\'s New Monthly Magazine in July 1879. Caine sent a copy of the magazine to the poet Rossetti, who by that time had become a virtual recluse and was \"ravaged by years of addiction to chloral and too much whisky\".[86]\\nRossetti wrote his first letter to Caine on 29 July 1879. This letter was the first of nearly two hundred in quick succession.[87] \\nAround this time Caine\\'s father was badly injured in an accident at work and Caine took responsibility for supporting his parents and siblings.[88] Early in 1880 he wrote Stones Crying Out, a short book on the restoration of old buildings. Two of the chapters were papers he had read at the Social Science Congress and Liverpool Library.[89] Rossetti introduced Caine to Ford Madox Brown, who was at the time working on The Manchester Murals. Following his visit to write an article on Brown\\'s frescoes in July 1880 they became friends. On a later visit Caine accepted Brown\\'s invitation to sit for one of the figures while he was working on The Expulsion of the Danes from Manchester, the third fresco.[90] On another visit he modelled for Crabtree watching the Transit of Venus A.D. 1639, the fifth fresco to be painted.[91] Caine and Rossetti eventually met in September 1880 when Caine visited Rossetti in his home at 16 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London, where he lived \"in shabby splendour\".[92]\\nThe strain of overworking was affecting Caine\\'s health and in 1881, deciding to focus on his literary career, he left his job at Bromley & Son and went to St John\\'s in the Vale, Cumbria.[93] Before long Rossetti wrote that he too was ill and asked Caine to go to London planning to return to Cumbria with him. By the time Caine arrived in London Rossetti had changed his mind and instead Caine became Rossetti\\'s housemate.[94] Early in September, persuaded by friends and family Rossetti spent a month with Caine at St John\\'s in the Vale, accompanied by Fanny Cornforth.[95] Whilst there, Caine recited a local myth to Rossetti. The myth was to become the inspiration for his first novel The Shadow of a Crime.[96] He was also delivering weekly lectures in Liverpool.[97]\\nCaine negotiated the acquisition of Rossetti\\'s largest painting Dante\\'s Dream of the Death of Beatrice by Liverpool\\'s Walker Art Gallery,[98][99] representing the painter at its installation in November 1881.[100] In January 1882 Caine\\'s anthology Sonnets of Three Centuries was published.\\nAfter Rossetti  \"had an attack of paralysis on one side\", his medical adviser, Mr John Marshall, recommended a change of air.[101] Architect John Seddon offered Rossetti the use of Westcliffe Bungalow at Birchington, Kent.[102] Caine eventually persuaded Rossetti to make the trip to Birchington, and they both arrived on 4 February 1882, accompanied by Caine\\'s sister and Rossetti\\'s nurse. Caine stayed with Rossetti until Rossetti\\'s death on Easter Sunday, 1882.[103][104]\\nFrom 1882 Caine was employed as a leader-writer on the Liverpool Mercury and was given free rein as to the subject and number of articles he wrote.[105][106] This gave him the opportunity to attend and review numerous first nights at the London theatres.[44] One review angered actor-playwright Wilson Barrett and he demanded a meeting with Caine.[107] Barrett concluding his complaint added \"I think you could write a play, and if someday you should hit on a subject suitable to me, I shall be glad if you will let me hear of it\".[108]\\nCaine\\'s Cobwebs of Criticism:  A Review of the First Reviewers of the Lake, Satanic and Cockney Schools was published in 1883. It began as a series of Liverpool lectures exposing unjustified reviews of poets Byron, Coleridge, Hunt, Keats, Shelley, Southey and Wordsworth that were written during their lifetimes[109]\\nReturning to London after Rossetti\\'s death, Caine moved into 18 Clement\\'s Inn in July 1882, sharing rooms with his academic friend Eric Robertson, where they often hosted intellectual gatherings.[110] They frequently had their evening meals delivered from a nearby coffee shop in Clare Market, which were brought by two young women; one was the 19-year-old Mary Chandler who was to eventually marry Caine.[nb 3]\\nMary was the fourth of seven children. She was born 23 April 1863, the daughter of Mary and William Chandler, a General Dealer, and grew up in Bethnal Green. William died in 1873 and her mother married John Ward, a Poulterer, in Shoreditch. The family moved to the City of London where John became a Hawker.[111]\\nMonths after Mary had first met Caine, John Ward and the other girl\\'s father confronted Caine and Robertson demanding marriage, claiming the young women had been \\'ruined\\'. According to Caine\\'s biographer, nothing more than \\'a bit of flirting\\' had taken place.[110] Refusing to marry, Caine went to Liverpool to deliver lectures, returning to London in early December 1882.[112] Upon Caine\\'s return Mary\\'s stepfather abandoned her at Clement\\'s Inn. Mary went to Sevenoaks for six months to be educated, financed by Caine; she had received little education as a child.[113]\\nAt the end of October 1883, with enough money to last about four months Caine, accompanied by Mary, went to the Isle of Wight where he rented Vectis Cottage, close to the cliffs and sea near Sandown.[114][115] There he set to work writing his first novel The Shadow of a Crime. Inspired by his Cumbrian heritage the plot was based on one of the oldest legends of the Lake District, told to him by his grandfather, Ralph Hall.[116][117][118] In it he uses the Cumbrian dialect that he had listened to and spoke during his childhood.[116] When he had finished he moved back to London. Living in rooms on the fourth floor of New Court, in Lincoln\\'s Inn, he re-wrote it.[119] After running as a serial in the Liverpool Weekly Mercury, Caine\\'s novel was published in February 1885, by Chatto & Windus, and serialised in several newspapers.[120] His reputation was immediately established, along with a foremost place among the novelists of the day.[121] He was later invited to write the story of writing The Shadow of a Crime, which after its appearance in the Idler was published in 1894 in My First Book.[122] After the publication of Caine\\'s first novel, Mary created a series of scrapbooks containing items relating to his public life.[123]\\nMary and Caine\\'s son, Ralph Hall, was born in their rented house Yarra, Worseley Road, Hampstead on 15 August 1884.[nb 3] The following month they moved to live in Aberleigh Lodge, Red House Lane, Bexleyheath, next door to William Morris\\' Red House, where they remained until 1889.[124]\\nCaine had many friends in London\\'s elite artistic and intellectual circles.[125] As a friend of Stoker and Irving for many years he became a regular at Irving\\'s Beefsteak Room gatherings at the Lyceum, presided over by Ellen Terry, where he became acquainted with the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII).[126] At one supper, where the only other guest was composer Alexander Mackenzie, Caine breaking the rules, brought his son Ralph with him.[127]\\nIn order to make essential money and acquire exposure in America, disregarding the advice of his friends, Caine\\'s short novel She\\'s All The World To Me, was published in New York, in 1885 by Harper & Brothers. She\\'s All The World To Me was the first of his novels to be set on the Isle of Man. Under American copyright laws the book\\'s copyright was forfeited to Harper and Brothers, a situation unforeseen by Caine, he was incensed.[128] Caine recycled much of the material from the book in his later works, particularly in The Deemster. She\\'s All The World To Me was serialised in the Liverpool Weekly Mercury between 21 March and 4 April 1885 immediately following The Shadow of a Crime.[129]\\nSet in the contrasting locations of the Vale of Newlands in the Lake District and Victorian London,[130] A Son of Hagar, Caine\\'s third novel was written in 1885–86 and published in 1886 by Chatto and Windus.[131][132] Begun in collaboration with Robert Buchanan, their partnership was discontinued early on after discovering they did not work well together.[131] Dealing with the theme of illegitimacy, Caine has written a story close to his own life.[133] The opening scene is set in Victorian London police court where a girl is charged with attempted suicide after she and her illegitimate baby had been dragged from the Thames, a scene he could well have witnessed while working as reporter.[134] Later Caine attempted to suppress A Son of Hagar from both of the Collected Editions of his novels. Licensed to Thomas Nelson in 1907 by Chatto, the novel was printed in the Nelson Library.[135]\\nIn 1886 Mary and Caine travelled to Scotland to watch Irving when he was on tour in Edinburgh where they covertly married on 3 September under Scottish law by declaration before witnesses.[nb 3] Mary became a devoted wife, reading all his work, advising and criticising when appropriate and was his first secretary.[136]\\nTwo of Caine\\'s sonnets, Where Lies the Land! and After Sunset, were included in William Sharp\\'s 1886 anthology Sonnets of this Century.[137] Publisher Walter Scott engaged Eric Robertson, Caine\\'s former roommate, to edit a series entitled Great Writers.[138] Aware of the study Caine had already made of Coleridge, Robertson asked Caine to contribute a brief biography of the poet to the series. In three weeks Caine wrote Life of Coleridge, published in 1887.[139] November the same year The Deemster was published in three volumes by Chatto & Windus. It was set in 18th century Isle of Man, where the title of Deemster is given to the Island\\'s judges. The plot includes the story of a fatal fight, with the body being taken out to sea only to float back to land the next day. It ran to more than fifty English editions and was translated into every major European language.[59] Caine sent a copy of the novel to Wilson Barrett as he suited the main character, then set to work adapting his novel into a stage version called Ben-my-Chree, Manx for \\'Girl of my Heart\\'.[139] Irving, after reading the book, saw potential in it, himself playing the Bishop.[140][141] The play opened at the Princess Theatre on 17 May 1888 and ran for a profitable nine weeks.[142] It was a popular staple on Barratt\\'s provincial and international tours for several years afterwards and was successfully produced by others to whom he licensed the rights.[142][143] An appreciative Caine acknowledged Barratt\\'s substantial contribution by naming him co-writer.[144]\\nThe first title published by Heinemann was Caine\\'s 1890 three-volume novel The Bondman, a plot of revenge and romance set in the late 18th century Isle of Man and Iceland. It commences with the story of a seaman who marries the daughter of Iceland\\'s Governor-General, abandoning her before the birth of their child.[145] Between June and November 1889 it was serialised in the Isle of Man Times, General Advertiser and several provincial newspapers.[146] Accompanied by Mary, Caine made a research visit to Iceland in August 1889, during which he made a seventy-mile round day trip from Reykjavik to Krysuvik.[147] William Heinemann was so pleased with initial sales, eventually selling almost half a million copies, that he named his company\\'s telegraphic address after the novel\\'s main character, \"Sunlocks\".[148]\\nCaine leased Castlerigg Cottage in Keswick in 1888. The following year Caine bought Hawthorns out of part of his earnings from Ben-my-Chree.[149] Hawthorns was a small square-built stone house on the Penrith Road, a mile outside Keswick, overlooking Bassenthwaite Lake and Derwentwater.  Caine also rented a pied-à-terre at Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, London.  Hawthorns was close to Chesnut Cottage that Shelley had rented in 1811 and Greta Hall home of the poets Coleridge and Southey.[150] The house had ten acres of land where Caine kept two ponies he had transported from Iceland.[151] Mary learned to make butter and cheese. The Caines lived at Hawthorns for four years.\\nIn 1890 Bram Stoker began his notes for his Dracula novel. Caine published a magazine serial in 1895 called Unto the Third and Fourth Generation. Stoker and Caine were lifetime literary friends. They shared an interest in mesmerism. Prior to being published in book form the story was renamed Drink: A Love Story on a Great Question. Drink contains a number of similarities to Stoker\\'s novel.[152] In 1906 Drink was published by George Newnes, and illustrated by expatriate Italian American illustrator and painter Cyrus Cuneo. It was described in the Manchester Guardian as \\'a rather gruesome love story\\'.[153] The story is of a girl who inherits a taste for alcohol from her father and is put on the road to recovery by hypnotic influence. Two hundred thousand copies of the book had been sold in England by the time the American edition was published by Appleton in 1907.[154][155]\\nCaine\\'s Mahomet is a four-act historical drama based on the life of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, written in 1890 for the actor-manager Henry Irving.  In Autumn 1889 Irving presented a copy of Henri de Bornier\\'s new play Mahomet to Caine, translated into English by Bram Stoker\\'s wife, Florence.[156] Irving had been granted the English rights by Jules Claretie, director of France\\'s Théâtre Français and he asked Caine to revise it for staging at the Lyceum.[157][158] The French government stopped Bornier\\'s play on 22 March 1890, partly due to the intervention of the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II.[159] Caine called the play\\'s plot \"false to history, untrue to character, Western in thought and Parisian in sentiment\".[160][161] He continued with his own version that concentrated on Muhammad\\'s flight from Mecca and his triumphant return from Medina years later.[162] Scenes were handwritten by Caine and subsequently reviewed by Irving after Stoker had them typed. Reviewed pages were returned with Irving\\'s edits and often Stoker\\'s suggestions.[163] On 20 June a piece appeared in the French Journal des débats soon followed by a longer piece in The Pall Mall Gazette connecting Bornier\\'s Mahomet with Irving\\'s English production.[164] William Henry (Abdullah) Quilliam orchestrated protests. In common with Caine he was of Manx descent, raised in Liverpool and had visited Morocco. Converting to Islam, Quilliam set up Britain\\'s first mosque and was made Sheikh al-Islam for the British Isles by Abdul Hamid II.  Rumour that the play would be produced in London caused unrest in Britain\\'s Muslim communities, threatened British rule in parts of India and strained the nation\\'s relations with the Ottoman Empire. It was banned by the Lord Chamberlain, Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Earl of Lathom in his capacity as licencer of stage plays.[165] Lathom\\'s intervention was unusual, illustrating the high level of concern by the British government.[166] Caine\\'s completed play was accepted by Edward Smith Willard for production in America. Influenced by Renan\\'s Life of Christ he spent the remainder of 1890 hastily writing his own version. Dissatisfied with the result he refused to publish the book, despite being offered three thousand pounds for it in 1894.[167]\\nCaine travelled to Tangier, Morocco, for three weeks in March 1890, researching Muslim and Jewish life.[168] Disregarding the advice of British consular officials Caine explored the Kasbah alone on foot at all hours of the day and night.[169] Returning to Tangier in Spring 1891 to pick up local colour for his next novel The Scapegoat, he suffered an attack of malarial fever.[170][171] Caine became the house-guest of Ion Perdicaris, who arranged Caine\\'s nursing until he was sufficiently recovered to return to England.[172] In July of the same year The Little Manx Nation was published. It was originally delivered in the form of three lectures on the history of the Isle of Man which were given at the Royal Institution, London on 22 and 29 January and 4 February 1891.[173][174] The book is dedicated to Manx poet Thomas Edward Brown, who supplied Caine with information on Manx legends and ballads.[175]\\nThe Scapegoat  was written at Hawthorns immediately after Caine returned home from Morocco, while he was still impeded by malaria.[176] First serialised in The Illustrated London News  between July and October 1891, and then in The Penny Illustrated Paper between October 1891 January 1892. In the story, little Naomi is deaf and dumb and blind. Her mother is dead. She lives with her father, in Israel\\'s house. As Israel changes his ways to become a better person Naomi starts to regain her lost senses. The novel was published in two volumes in September 1891 by William Heinemann, and simultaneously in Europe, America and Canada.[177] Set in Morocco in the last years of the Sultan Abd er-Rahman, it exposed anti-Semitic persecution and was described as a \\'scathing indictment of Moroccan tyranny\\'.[170] The book was praised by \\'the most intelligent and influential members of the respectable Jewish community in London\\'.[178] Caine\\'s Connections with the British Jewish community extended back to Caine\\'s youth. Novelist Israel Zangwill, enlisted Caine in the Zionist movement.[179] The Scapegoat brought Caine a considerable correspondence, mainly because of its pro-Jewish stance.[180] At this time Caine and Mary\\'s second son, Derwent was born on 12 September 1891.\\nFollowing the publication of The Scapegoat, Caine was approached by Hermann Adler, the Chief Rabbi and chairman of the Russo-Jewish Committee. Jews were fleeing Russia due to the pogroms and resulting atrocities happening there.[181] Adler, certain no Jew would be allowed entry, requested Caine go to Russia and Poland on behalf of the committee. Caine\\'s plans to depart for Russia after Christmas 1891 were delayed until 15 June 1892 due to famine and riots there.[182] Caine funded the trip himself, refusing subsidies offered by the committee. He carried Adler\\'s letter, in Hebrew, to present to the rabbis in the various towns on his journey, which \"secured him everywhere a most hospitable reception\" and for protection against the Russian authorities Caine carried a letter from Lord Salisbury, then Prime Minister.[183] Caine managed to visit several Jewish communities in the Pale of Settlement but got no further than the frontier towns as many were dying due to a cholera outbreak. Fearing he was to suffer the same fate he returned to London, in time to attend \\nLord Alfred Tennyson\\'s funeral in October 1892.[184] Caine remained in London after the funeral working on three novellas Cap\\'n Davey\\'s Honeymoon, The Last Confession and The Blind Mother, published in 1893 as one volume entitled Cap\\'n Davey\\'s Honeymoon. The book was edited by and dedicated to Stoker. At his suggestion, the last part of the title story was rewritten and The Last Confession was added.[184] Set in Morocco, The Last Confession is based on Rossetti\\'s blank-verse poem of the same name.[185]\\nFor the purpose of writing The Manxman Caine rented Greeba Castle for six months, a castellated house in the Isle of Man overlooking the Douglas to Peel road.[186] It was this book, published as one volume in August 1894 by Heinemann, that ended the system of three-volume novels.[187] It is the story of Pete, a fisherman, considered by Kate\\'s father as too poor to marry her. Pete leaves to make his fortune, and is reported dead. Kate falls in love with Philip, Pete\\'s cousin and friend. Pete returns, creating a dilemma. The character of Pete was based on the Peel fishermen Caine mixed with and Joseph Mylchreest, a Manxman who made his fortune diamond mining in South Africa.[186] Caine took full advantage of the subsequent Press attention. He was photographed and interviewed for the monthly magazines.[188] The British sales of The Manxman totalled nearly 400,000.[189] It was translated into twelve languages, selling over half a million copies by 1913.[190] While in London in June and July 1984, Caine wrote a dramatic version of The Manxman, with Philip as the main character. Caine offered it to Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who refused it as being unlikely to appeal to the Haymarket Theatre audiences.[191] On 22 August 1894, three weeks after the book was published, Wilson Barrett\\'s adaptation opened at the Grand Theatre, Leeds.[143] Caine bought the Greeba Castle estate in 1896 with part of his earnings from The Manxman.[187] His rented London home, 48 Ashley Gardens, in one of five red-brick Victorian mansion blocks adjacent to Westminster Cathedral, was changed to 2 Whitehall Court between Whitehall and the Victoria Embankment.\\nCaine wrote a guidebook entitled The Little Man Island: Scenes and Specimen Days in the Isle of Man for the 1894 tourist season. Published by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company it comprises a mixture of descriptions, pictures and advertising.  At the end of the 19th century the Isle of Man was a popular tourist destination, a result of the Wakes Weeks, when Lancashire mills and factories closed for holidays.[192] To meet growing demand the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company purchased new steamers to bring many thousands of tourists to Douglas from Liverpool. The Isle of Man Advertising Committee was set up in 1894 under the Advertising Rate Act.[193] A group of bankers, local businessmen and developers built new hotels, boarding houses and entertainment venues. They formed a Committee publicising the Isle of Man as a holiday resort, opening an office in London with Caine\\'s brother in charge.[194] When Caine wrote the Deemster in six weeks at a boarding house on the Douglas esplanade he saw these developments. He believed that the Island\\'s economic prosperity lay in developing this trade.[195] The success of Caine\\'s novels set in the Isle of Man boosted the tourist trade.[196] Tynwald Day, the island\\'s national day, became better known both in England and America because of his novels.[197] Caine and Greeba Castle became a visitor attraction.[198] Cruising around Great Britain aboard the Royal yacht, King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra visited the Isle of Man, in August 1902.[199] They were the first British monarchs to set foot on Manx soil.[200] The King had read most of Caine\\'s works and through reading them he wanted to visit the island.[201] The Queen enjoyed Caine\\'s Manx novels and was interested to see where his characters lived.[202] The royal party enjoyed Caine\\'s hospitality.[203] He was invited to join the royal couple on their yacht and to accompany them on their tour of the island the following day.[204]\\nAt a time copyrights in Canada were governed by British laws and legal framework the Canadian Government was attempting to enact their 1889 Copyright Bill. Canadian publishers sought to exclude competition from the United States.[205] Collection of duty on imported foreign reprints of British copyright books was to be stopped after 27 March 1895.[206][207] This situation, named the Canadian copyright question, caused concern to the British Government and they involved both the Copyright Association and the Society of Authors, asking them to comment.[208] During the ongoing discussions Caine maintained high profile, his interventions changing the course of the debate.[209] Publishers in American recognised the threat of their market being flooded with cheap Canadian reprints on which no copyright fees would be paid.[210] Proposed by Caine, the Society of Authors passed a unanimous vote, on 25 February 1895, against the Canadian Copyright Act. Caine suggested \"all authors should bind together to oppose the passing of the Act\".[211] The Society sent a petition to the Marquess of Rippon, signed by over 1500 mainly authors and publishers, requesting Queen Victoria withhold assent of the Canadian Copyright Bill.[212] If passed, there would be nothing preventing other colonies asking for the same, threatening authors with the loss of the whole Colonial market.[213] The Society of Authors invited Caine to act as their representative in Canada and to negotiate with the Canadian Government on the 1889 Canadian Act.[210][214] Similarly Frederick Richard Daldy represented the Copyright Association.[215][216] Edmund Newcome, the Canadian Deputy Minister of Justice, eventually visited England in August 1895 to address the Canadian copyright problem, after his plans to visit had been postponed multiple times.[210] Newcombe, instructed only to meet with the government, met with Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, in London to begin work on a new draft copyright bill. The Copyright Association and the Society of Authors were kept informed of proceedings.[217]\\nCaine arrived in New York 25 September 1895, accompanied by his wife Mary and eldest son Ralph, where they were met by his New York publisher William Appleton, an active in the struggle for an international copyright.[218] He carried with him a letter of introduction to the Government of Canada from Chamberlain.[217] On the street he was mobbed by fans.[219] The following month Caine reached Canada, where he met with leading members of the publishing trade. He had long discussions with the Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie Bowell and the Canadian Minister of Justice Charles Tupper in Ottawa. At the request of the Canadian Copyright Association Caine went to Toronto where he had talks with the Toronto publishers.[220] Caine resolved the dispute between the Canadian publishers, the Canadian Copyright Association and English authors. The proposed solution, that Canadian publishers would have the right to republish copyright works that had not been published in Canada within sixty days of publication elsewhere, was incorporated into the draft copyright bill. On 25 November 1895 Caine presented the draft bill at the Ottawa copyright conference where all parties agreed to it.[221] The Canadian authorities and publishers were satisfied with the proposal put forward from England as were the American authors and publishers.[222] The bill never became law, the 1889 Act was abandoned and a more flexible solution was found by 1900.[216][223]\\nTaking two years to write, Caine\\'s novel The Christian was published by Heinemann in 1897. It is the first novel in Britain to have sold over a million copies[224] The book was inspired by Rossetti\\'s verses Mary Magdalene at the Door of Simon The Pharisee, written for his painting, depicting a man trying to pluck back a woman about to enter the gates of heaven. Caine followed it with a lecture tour of Scotland, a one-man dramatic performance of his novelette Home Sweet Home.[225] The Christian was serialised in Britain in the Windsor Magazine between December 1896 and November 1897 and in the United States in Munsey\\'s Magazine between November 1896 and January 1898.  Mainly set in Victorian London, it is the story of Glory Quayle, a young woman living an independent life who becomes an actress, and John Storm, who enters the priesthood. It was the first time that Caine had taken up the Woman Question. The character of John Storm is drawn from a composite of the Hon. and Rev.  James Adderley, an Anglican priest of Berkley Chapel, Mayfair, London, and Father Stanton, who became an Anglican bishop.[226] Caine dramatised the book in 1896. His play was so popular with the public that the Daily Mail published it in a thick-paper, illustrated edition.[227] He directed the play, travelling to New York where he went on to deliver a series of lectures and readings there.[228][229] Viola Allen produced the play for the first time on the stage at Albany, New York on 25 September 1898. It opened at the Knickerbocker Theatre on 10 October 1898, running for twenty-one weeks in New York. Almost one thousand clergymen attended a matinee on 15 November 1898.[230][231] George C. Tyler, reportedly made one million dollars from the Broadway production of The Christian.[232] On his return to London after being on tour, Wilson Barratt gave Caine half of an advance payment received from an Australian manager for Barratt\\'s stage adaptation of The Christian. Caine rejected both the money and the play. Barratt unsuccessfully sued Caine on the grounds that they had an agreement to collaborate on the dramatisation.[233] The Christian was first produced in England at the Duke of York\\'s Theatre in October 1899.[234] It failed after two months. Caine authorised a touring production with his sister Lily playing Glory Quayle and managed by her husband George Day which in 1907 was still continuously performed by up to three companies.[235] After Finnish politician and writer Aino Malmberg sought aid from Caine on her country\\'s behalf, he offered the Finnish rights to the Finnish National Theatre. Finland belonged to the Russian Empire and was actively seeking Independence. Malmberg translated Caine\\'s works into Finnish.[234]\\nCaine and his wife, Mary, spent four winters in Rome, renting a house, 18 Trinità de\\' Monti, near the Spanish Steps.[236] On their visit between January and April 1901 Caine finished The Eternal City, his greatest commercial success.[237] It is Caine\\'s only novel to be first conceived as a play.[238] The story begins in Rome in 1900 at the fictional Pope Pius X\\'s jubilee celebrations, at the height of the dispute between the Vatican and the Italian state on the temporal power of the Church. David Rossi, a socialist and republican is accused of conspiring to assassinate the Italian king. He opposes Baron Bonelli, a corrupt prime minister. Bonelli tries to prevent the culmination of the love story between his mistress Donna Roma Volonna and Rossi. The Eternal City was serialised in Britain in 1901 in The Lady\\'s Magazine and in the United States in Collier\\'s Weekly, between February and August 1901. Immediately afterwards it was published in book form by Heinemann, with an initial print run of 100,000, running to twenty-six editions, selling more than a million copies in English alone and translated into thirteen languages.[239] The stage adaptation opened at His Majesty\\'s Theatre, London on 2 October 1902, produced by actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, with incidental music by Italian composer Pietro Mascagni.[240][241] A week after the play opened in London, Caine republished the novel, cutting all the political parts and following the story of the play making it into a \\'theatre edition\\'.[242] The American production of The Eternal City premiered on 17 November, at the Victoria Theatre, New York City, with Viola Allen as Roma, Frederic De Belleville as Bonelli, and Edward J. Morgan as Rossi. Caine supervised rehearsals.[243] Towards the end of 1903 six companies were performing The Eternal City, in England, USA, Australia and South Africa.\\nIn 1901 Caine bought Household Words, the literary magazine founded by Charles Dickens in 1850. He appointed his son Ralph as editor, and it was sold in 1904.[244][245] The Eternal City appeared as two instalments in the Christmas 1901 and January 1902 editions.[246] He made many contributions including articles about Pope Leo XIII, whom he had a private audience with, the story A Maid of Mona and a serialisation of The Manxman.[247][248][249] His writings on Roman Catholicism caused serious offence to his fellow members of the National Club of London, founded as a Protestant club.[250]\\nBetween 1902 and 1904 the Caine\\'s rented a large early Victorian house in London on Wimbledon Common, The Hermitage.[251] It had been the last home of Scottish novelist Margaret Oliphant.\\nTo obtain local colour for his novel The Prodigal Son Caine visited Iceland in 1903. On one of two exploration trips that started from Reykjavik Caine discovered a cave about 200 feet long in the valley of Thingvellir, afterwards named \"Hall\\'s Hellin\" (Hall\\'s cave).[252] On 26 August Caine was at the close of the Iceland Althing where he was a guest of Magnús Stephensen, the island\\'s Governor.[253] At the Parliamentary dinner which followed, Caine was introduced \"as a distinguished \"skald\" (bard), whose writings were widely known and greatly admired in Iceland\".[254] The Prodigal Son was published in November 1904 by Heinemann and translated into thirteen languages. It is set in a sheep-rearing community in rural Iceland, with scenes in London and the French Riviera.  In The Prodigal Son Magnus learns on his wedding day that his bride, Thora, is in love with his brother Oscar, a composer. She marries Oscar after Magnus releases her from the engagement. When Thora dies, a distraught Oscar places the only copies of his compositions in her coffin. Later he has her grave opened and his music retrieved. Caine\\'s use of a similar event to Rossetti\\'s exhumation of Elizabeth Siddal, where Rossetti recovered his poems that he had buried with her, caused a lasting rift between Caine and the Rossetti family.[255] The Prodigal Son was simultaneously dramatised, the copyright performance held at the Grand Theatre, Douglas.  American and British productions opened days apart in 1905, at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., on 28 August, the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York City on 4 September and at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London on 7 September, with George Alexander playing Oscar and Caine\\'s sister Lilian playing Thora.[256] After a long run at Drury Lane it was revived in 1907.[257]\\nIn September 1906 Caine\\'s dramatised version of The Bondman was produced in London\\'s Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, with Mrs Patrick Campbell playing a leading role and Caine\\'s son, Derwent (aged sixteen), making a stage début.[258] A copyright performance had taken place at the Theatre Royal, Bolton in November 1982.[259] Caine revised the play for Arthur Collins, moving part of the story to Sicily and creating a happy ending.[260] The highlight of the show was the sulphur mine explosion and volcano eruption. In April 1906 Collins and Caine had gone on a research trip where they spent a day with Leone Testa, the inspector-general of Sicily\\'s sulphur mines and while visiting Naples they witnessed Mount Vesuvius erupt. The show ran for eleven weeks followed by eight weeks at the Adelphi Theatre and a revival of The Prodigal Son. The production went on tour in the UK and America.[261] \\nJapanese actor and a founder of Japanese modern theatre Otojirō Kawakami staged the play in Japan in 1909, changing the setting to Japan and the Philippines and included the volcanic eruption. When Kawakami\\'s new western style theatre Teikoku-za opened in Osaka in March 1910 the first production was The Bondman.\\n1908 saw the publication of My Story, described by Bram Stoker as \"autobiographical rather than an autobiography and gives insight to the life and character of his many friends and their influence on his life and work, and of the gradual growth of his mind and of his importance in the world as the success of each book gave him further opportunities.\"[262]\\n\\nOn 13 June 1906 British officers shot pigeons for sport in Denshawai, an Egyptian village whose inhabitants were pigeon farmers, resulting in a clash between the officers and several villagers.  One villager, falsely accused of murder was killed on the spot. Four villagers were hanged and others punished by jail sentences, hard labour and lashings. The Denshawai Incident proved a turning point in the history of the British occupation of Egypt, starting a fierce political debate both in Egypt and Britain in which intellectuals and men of letters participated, eventually causing the resignation of Lord Cromer, the redoubtable British Consul General and de facto ruler of Egypt since 1882. Crucially poet Wilfred Scawen Blunt exposed the facts in his pamphlet Atrocities of Justice Under British Rule in Egypt, provoking a public outcry in Britain. George Bernard Shaw drafted a petition published in The New Age with the main purpose of gaining the release of the Egyptian prisoners.[263] Shaw denounces the \"Denshawai horror\" in his Preface to Politicians that introduces his John Bull\\'s Other Island. Caine\\'s literary response to the debate is his controversial novel The White Prophet.[264] Shaw reviews The White Prophet and opposes literary censorship in Bernard Shaw on Shams of Rule and of Religion.[265] Set in Egypt at the start of the twentieth century, twenty years into the British occupation and opening with a ceremonial re-enactment of the Battle of Omdurman, The White Prophet is the story of Colonel Charles George Lord, a British officer who joins the crusade of Ishmael Ameer, a Muslim prophet against selfishness and sedition. Lord compares him with Christ and John the Baptist. Ameer plans a coup against the British in Sudan, after developing political ambitions.  The White Prophet is Caine\\'s only book never to have been reprinted; its sympathies for Egyptian nationalism rendered it a commercial failure.[266] Caine used material from Mahomet and The Mahdi in the novel.  Accompanied by his wife, he made three research visits to Egypt, March to May 1907, then January to May in 1908 and similarly in 1909 when he was joined by actor manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree.[267] Cromer failed to meet Caine during his visit to Egypt in 1907, instead Caine wrote urging him to grant the Egyptians wish \"for a speedy fulfilment of England\\'s promise to get out of Egypt as soon as it was safe to do so\" and to \"yield to legitimate claims to national independence\".[268][269] Originally entitled The White Christ, it was serialised in the British and US editions of The Strand Magazine between December 1908 and November 1909, and subsequently translated into seven languages. The Arabic translation was serialised in Cairo-based newspaper al-Minbar.[270] Douglas Sladen read the first two instalments of The White Prophet and had the idea of writing a counterblast, the novel The Tragedy of the Pyramids: A Romance of Army Life in Egypt. Closing the preface he writes \"I felt bound to challenge the false light in which he presents the British Army of Occupation in Egypt to the public\".[271] A copyright performance was performed at the Garrick Theatre, London on 27 November 1908. Beerbohm Tree\\'s plans to produce a dramatised version at His Majesty\\'s Theatre, London, which he was to direct and star in, were abandoned following threats to lobby the Lord Chamberlain against granting a licence for the play, banning it.[272] Cromer is reported to have protested to the Lord Chamberlain\\'s Department that \"the state of the Nationalist agitation in Egypt made a dramatic representation of some of its features injudicious\".[273] The character of John Lord is widely believed to be Cromer.[274] Promoting the publication of The White Prophet by Heinemann on 12 August 1909, Caine published a series of eight articles Aspects of the East in The Daily Telegraph. Heinemann published Shaw\\'s The Critics of The White Prophet as a pamphlet, endorsing the novel\\'s political viewpoint.  It was to have been the preface for the second edition.[275]On 15 August 1910, Caine\\'s new stage adaptation of The Deemster entitled The Bishop\\'s Son opened at the Grand Theatre, Douglas, Isle of Man, with Caine\\'s son, Derwent, playing Dan. It went on to open at London\\'s Garrick Theatre on 28 September 1910 with Bransby Williams as Dan, which ran for seven performances.\\nCaine\\'s novel The Woman Thou Gavest Me: Being the Story of Mary O\\'Neill, published by Heinemann in 1913, \"caused the biggest furore of any of his novels\".[276] Translated into nine languages, worldwide advance orders for the book exceeded 200,000.[2] From October 1912 it was serialised in Britain in Nash\\'s Magazine and concurrently in the United States in Hearst\\'s Magazine. The following month serialisation began in The Australian Women\\'s Weekly. Circulating libraries divided new books into three categories: satisfactory, doubtful and objectionable.[277]\\nThey attempted to boycott The Woman Thou Gavest Me along with Compton Mackenzie\\'s Sinister Street and W. B. Maxwell\\'s The Devil\\'s Garden, for failing their criteria. The authors directed a publicity campaign opposing the boycott.[278] The Woman Thou Gavest Me, the second of Caine\\'s novels to address the Woman Question, \"arraigns the divorce laws\" of the time.[279] Father Bernard Vaughan, known for his sermons on The Sins of Society, denounced Caine\\'s book saying \"it showed startling ignorance of Roman Catholic doctrine and practice\".[280] The novel was one of several books the Catholic Federation in Auckland, New Zealand wanted removed from sale.[281][282] In Wyndham, Western Australia the committee of Little River Mechanics Institute Free Library ordered the book banned and burnt.[283] American newspapers reported of a Methodist preacher\\'s daughter that eloped and married the son of a prominent family, who later divorced her and took away her child. She was arrested on the street for Immorality. After three days in jail Eugene V. Debs, five times Socialist candidate for President of the United States sheltered her in his home. It was Debs\\' \"challenge to the Christianity of Terre Haute\", Indiana. Parallels were drawn between the problem that Debs handled in real life and Caine\\'s fictional story of Mary O\\'Neill, who marries unhappily and ends up on the street without shelter, with the whole world turned against her.[284] The Woman Thou Gavest Me was reprinted five times before the end of 1913 when nearly half a million copies had been sold.[276] The Times Literary Supplement listed it as the most popular novel of that year. New York\\'s Bookman, listed it as the fifth best-seller of October 1913.[285]\\nEnglish fiction was represented in Europe by Hall Caine, as French fiction was by Anatole France, Italian by Gabriele D\\'Annunzio, and German by Hermann Sudermann.[286] \"Among English novelists who have made from fifty to sixty cents for every word in a long novel are Hall Caine and Marie Corelli. Compared with such money earners as these, Dickens, Thackeray, and George Eliot were poorly paid for their labor\".[287]\\nOn 24 October 1901, Caine was elected a Member of the House of Keys in a by-election as a liberal-aligned independent for the constituency of Ramsey, Isle of Man, by a majority of 267 votes. Caine sought election to the Keys after the collapse of Dumbell\\'s Banking Company on Friday 2 February 1900.[288][289] The crash resulted in a number of resignations and retirements, resulting in eleven by-elections.[290] The Bank had held most of the island\\'s cash deposits and left businesses and residents without money.[291] At the General election in 1903 Caine was re-elected for another five years.\\nDuring Caine\\'s election campaign he supported dominion status for the Island with a Manxman as Lieutenant-Governor, a directly elected Legislative Council and departmental officials appointed by and responsible to Tynwald.  A pamphlet entitled Hall Caine\\'s Letters and Speeches on Manx Politics was published in 1903, containing his election speech and articles he wrote for the Daily Mail and Black and White, describing his experiences and aspirations. In recognition of his single election speech Caine was appointed vice-president of the Land Nationalisation Society of Great Britain.[292]\\nThe Manx National Reform League made constitutional and social reform the central issues in the general election of 1903, after an extra-parliamentary initiative by journalist and printer Samuel Norris. It was influenced by Liberal demands for political change in the United Kingdom. In 1903 Caine was elected the first president of the Manx National Reform League. In 1904 the new House of Keys established a committee on constitutional reform, chaired by Caine, that prepared the 1907 petition for constitutional reform.[293]\\nCaine retired from active politics in 1908. Due to the other pressures on his time he seldom spoke in the Keys. He also had little time to offer to politics on a larger scale. Prior to the Ramsey by-election, Caine was invited by Lloyd George to stand for the British parliament but he refused.[294]\\nCaine was aged 61 at the outbreak of the Great War. The British secretly set up the War Propaganda Bureau under MP Charles Masterman. Caine was one of twenty-five leading authors Masterman invited to the Bureau\\'s London headquarters, Wellington House on 2 September 1914 with the purpose of best promoting Britain\\'s interests during the war.[295] Shortly after, Caine was one of fifty-three of the leading authors in Britain to sign the \\'Authors\\' Declaration\\', a manifesto drafted by Masterman stating that Britain \"could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war.\" Issued on 17 September the document was sent by special cable to the New York Times.[296] Caine abandoned literary contracts in America valued at 150,000 dollars in order to devote all his energies to the British war effort.[297]\\nFollowing the Rape of Belgium Caine edited King Albert\\'s Book in support of the exiled King Albert of Belgium.[298] It was Caine\\'s idea and was published at Christmas 1914 by The Daily Telegraph. The proceeds from the book, £20,000, went to the Daily Telegraph Belgium Fund, a fund created to support British efforts to receive and maintain Belgian refugees in Britain. In previous years Caine had edited several of these volumes already, the most recent for Queen Alexandra\\'s charities in 1905 and 1908. Caine invited authors, artists, composers, statesmen and many notable people to present their view of events in Belgium. King Albert‘s Book contains contributions from two hundred and fifty of the most famous people of the time. Among the contributors are British Prime Minister Asquith and then Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, painters Claude Monet and John Collier and composer Claude Debussy.[299]\\nKing Albert of Belgium made Caine an Officer of the Order of Leopold of Belgium for his humanitarian aid to the Belgian refugees in 1918. Caine\\'s portrait by the Belgian painter, Alfred Jonniaux, was presented to him by the Fine Art Department of the Belgian Government.[300][nb 4]\\nCaine wrote extensively in the English, American and Italian newspapers. He claimed that by this work and his personal influence with Italian statesmen he greatly helped bring Italy into the war on the side of the allies.[297] President Woodrow Wilson had declared the United States neutral and his policy of neutrality was enormously popular with the American people.[301] \\nCaine urged America to join the war by writing articles, mainly for The New York Times and in 1915 he gave a series of lectures in the United States but these were not well received. In September 1915, at the conclusion of the first year of war, a series of articles featuring royalty, countries and events which included Archduke Ferdinand, the Kaiser and the Sinking of the RMS Lusitania that Caine had contributed to The Daily Telegraph were published as a book entitled The Drama of 365 Days: Scenes in the Great War. Caine attended Nurse Edith Cavell\\'s memorial service in St Paul\\'s Cathedral, London, on 29 October 1915; the World War I British nurse who is celebrated for saving the lives of soldiers in Brussels from all sides without distinction. His account was published in The Daily Telegraph on 30 October and extensively in other newspapers.[302] In 1916 he was invited to work with Lord Robert Cecil at the Foreign Office towards the creation of the League of Nations after the end of the war. Our Girls: Their Work for the War, is the title of Caine\\'s Christmas book published by Messrs Hutchinson early in December 1916, consisting of a series of Caine\\'s articles written for the Ministry of Munitions, together with additional stories of women\\'s working lives in the factories and in the hospitals. It was designed to be a gift for munitions girls to send to their men at the front.\\nThe National War Aims Committee was set up in 1917 to focus on domestic propaganda. Caine was recruited for the committee by the Prime Minister David Lloyd George to write the screenplay for the propaganda film Victory and Peace, designed to show what would happen in a German invasion.[303] Most of the negative of the newly finished film was destroyed in a fire at the offices of the London Film Company in June 1918.[304] It was re-filmed over four-months, just as the war ended and was never released.[305]\\nTowards the end of 1917 Caine was offered a baronetcy in recognition of the contribution he made to the war effort as an allied propagandist and his position as a leading man of letters. Caine declined the hereditary peerage and accepted a knighthood instead. He was made Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire(KBE), insisting on being called, not \\'Sir Thomas\\' but \\'Sir Hall\\'.[306]\\nBegun in 1914 Caine\\'s The Master of Man: The Story of a Sin had been set aside for the duration of the Great War and resumed on the day after armistice in 1918. It is the story of Bessie Collister who has an illegitimate child. The baby\\'s father Victor Stowell, as judge, has to try Bessie for the murder of their child. Heinmann published the novel in July 1921. Of the initial one hundred thousand copies printed seventy thousand were advance orders.[307] Due to his age and health Caine announced it was to be his last novel.[308] Sales of The Eternal City in English had reached one million and fifty-two English editions of The Deemster had been published.[309]\\nA Collected Edition of Caine\\'s novels followed, also published by Heinmann, issued not in order of publication but in the order of public demand.[310]\\nThe following year Caine acquired the Sunday Illustrated newspaper which had been founded by Horatio Bottomley.\\nCaine\\'s last novel The Woman of Knockaloe was brought out in 1923, this time published by Cassell\\'s.  Caine\\'s strong anti-German feeling had turned to advocacy of reconciliation and pacifism. In the editorial note Newman Flower explains that the story was never intended to be published, but Flower happened to see the manuscript and persuaded Caine to publish it immediately. The book deals with the harm caused by racial hatred after Mona Craine, a British woman, falls in love with Oskar Heine, a German prisoner of war. The scene of the story is Knockaloe, a farm on the west coast of the Isle of Man, turned into an internment camp 1914–1918 for alien civilians. Caine was former part owner of the farm and suggested the establishment of the camp to the government. The camp was the first and largest of its kind in Europe, containing about twenty-five thousand aliens and two thousand British guard. The site was overlooked by Greeba Castle, Caine\\'s Manx house, four miles away.[311] That year he sold the Sunday Illustrated. On Armistice Day 1923 Caine\\'s first radio broadcast, A Counsel of Peace, was made to the nation from the British Broadcasting Corporation in London.[312][313]\\nCaine\\'s last published work in his lifetime was a revised version of Recollections of Rossetti, with a shortened title, to coincide with the 1928 centenary of Rossetti\\'s birth.\\nDuring the last eight years of his life Caine devoted himself to his life\\'s work a Life of Christ, which he had begun in 1893. On at least three occasions Caine visited Palestine and Transjordania, the last in 1929; consulting the best-known theologians of the time, and reading every book he could obtain on the subject. His health broke down under the strain and the book remained unfinished. In the statement he prepared for his obituary was written, \"one-fifth of the book is in a form fit for publication, the remainder not being in a condition which renders it possible that another author should complete it\".[314] The statement was disregarded by his sons and after extensive editing the book was published posthumously by his sons in 1938. The handwritten manuscript, including text and words, contained three million words, much of it indecipherable, to the extent that Caine\\'s former secretaries were called in to transcribe it. An editor, journalist Robert Leighton was employed to cut it down to half-a-million words. \"It was severely criticised by the reviewers and the sales were not large\".[315][316]\\nAlong with Winston Churchill, Caine received the Order of the Companions of Honour in October 1922 for his services to literature and was granted the Freedom of Douglas in 1929 for promoting the Isle of Man through his writings.[317]\\nMost of Caine\\'s novels have been made into black-and-white silent films. The first film adaptation is The Christian (1911), by West\\'s Pictures in Australia. The twenty-eight-minute unauthorised film is the first directed by Franklyn Barrett. The Christian features the cast of the stage production by William Anderson\\'s Company. An unauthorised film of The Bondman (1916) was made by Fox Film Corporation in the United States and is the first film they released under their De Luxe brand. All of Fox\\'s 110 musicians accompanied The Bondman screenings. The music is composed by Max Steiner, Fox\\'s musical director. A financial and critical success it was re-released in 1918 as one of Fox\\'s Big Six. A further film version of The Bondman was released as The Red Samson (1917) in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The director was Michael Curtiz, who had by 1916 become one of Hungary\\'s most important directors.[318]\\nThe first authorised film of a Caine novel is The Christian (1914) released in the United States by the Vitagraph Liebler Company. The first eight reel film they made. Vitagraph leased the Harris Theatre on West 42nd Street, for the purpose of exclusively showing their own films, opening with The Christian starring Earle Williams and Edith Storey.[319] Caine wrote the film scenario, the first time ever that a famous author undertook a film scenario of their own work. Vitagraph staff writer Eugene Mullins followed Caine\\'s own scenario.[320]\\nAdapted and directed by established American screenwriter and director George Loane Tucker, The Christian (1915) was made by the London Film Company. The 9,000 feet film stars Caine\\'s son Derwent Hall Caine as John Storm.  The Manxman (1916), also produced by the London Film Company and directed by Tucker, was filmed on the Isle of Man and, when released drew huge crowds in Britain and America. It was one of the few British films distributed in the United States that went on to become a financial and critical success.[321] Starring Derwent Hall Caine and Marian Swayne The Deemster (1917), made in the United States, is the first special feature film Arrow Film Corporation made.  Shot on location on Block Island, Rhode Island, the film was originally entitled The Bishop’s Son after Caine\\'s 1910 stage adaptation of The Deemster in which Derwent had also played Dan Mylrea and on which the film is based.  Caine remained closely involved with the production; based in England, Caine reviewed the scenario and produced drawings of the character of the buildings to be used.\\nAdolph Zukor\\'s Famous Players Film Company produced the first version of The Eternal City (1915). The $100,000 epic film features stage star Pauline Frederick. Made on location in London and Italy in 1914 the production was interrupted by the start of the Great War and was completed in New York. For distribution of initially The Eternal City and other prestigious feature-length films Famous Players created the Select Booking Agency. Caine cabled the producers after attending the British premiere at Marble Arch Pavilion, in London congratulating them.[322] The film was re-released in 1918 as part of the Paramount \"Success Series\".\\nPrime Minister David Lloyd George recruited Caine in 1917 to write the screenplay for the propaganda film Victory and Peace (1918), made in Britain and directed by Herbert Brenon. Caine was appointed as chief adviser to the film campaign department of the National War Aims Committee. Lloyd George chose Caine due to his experience in the field of cinema and his \"reputation as a man of letters\".[323] On 20 September 1917, in Ithaca, New York, Brenon\\'s representative obtained the film rights of The Woman Thou Gavest Me from Derwent Hall Caine, Caine\\'s American agent, intending to start work in November 1917. The film was advertised but it was never made by Brenon. Adapted for the screen by Beulah Marie Dix, The Woman Thou Gavest Me (1919) was made by Famous Players–Lasky. Katherine MacDonald, stars in the film as Mary MacNeil. Immediately after completing The Woman Thou Gavest Me she set up her own production company.[324]\\nCaine wrote the screenplay of Darby and Joan (1920). Made by Master Films the film was directed by Percy Nash featuring Derwent Hall Caine and Ivy Close. Many of the scenes were shot in the Isle of Man.[325]\\nThe fourth film adaptation of The Christian (1923) was by Goldwyn Pictures and directed by the celebrated Maurice Tourneur. Along with some of the cast, Tourneur travelled to the Isle of Man for location shooting where they were joined by Caine who co-operated in the filming of his work and held daily conferences with Tourneur.[326] After the film was completed in the United States a print was sent to Caine in London where he wrote the intertitles.[327]\\nAdapted and directed by A.E. Coleby The Prodigal Son (1923) was made by Stoll Pictures, the largest British film company of the early 1920s, as the centrepiece of their 1923 releases. Costing £37,000 it was at the time the most expensive British production made. The film\\'s length at 18,454 feet made it the longest commercially made British film. The 4-hour 40-minute picture was released in two parts; part two titled The Return of the Prodigal.\\nBenito Mussolini featured in The Eternal City (1923) by the Samuel Goldwyn Company. Directed by George Fitzmaurice and shot on location in Rome less than a year after the March on Rome resulted in Mussolini\\'s National Fascist Party rising to power in Italy. The film portrays Mussolini as a leader saving his people from communism. Caine disapproved of the adaptation and attempted to withdraw his name from it.[328]\\nThe first American made film by noted Swedish actor-director Victor Sjöström for Goldwyn Pictures was adapted from The Master of Man. The title was changed to \"The Judge and the Woman\" before settling on Name the Man (1924). Samuel Goldwyn began negotiating the film rights before the novel was finished.[329]\\nThe Woman of Knockaloe was filmed by Paramount Pictures in 1927 as Barbed Wire and is the second American made film by German director Erich Pommer. It deals with a phase of WWI where German prisoners of war suffer the hatred of the French women and yet find romance. Then Alfred Hitchcock arrived on the Isle of Man to film The Manxman (1929) but he and Caine did not get on well and the rest of the film was shot in Cornwall.  The Manxman was Hitchcock\\'s last silent film. Caine was not happy with it.[330]\\nThe British silent film The Bondman (1929) was directed by Herbert Wilcox.\\nAfter retiring from the army in 1922, Colonel Hanna joined the British Board of Film Censors and held the position of vice-president and chief censor throughout the 1930s. Gaumont British\\'s plan to film The White Prophet was abandoned after objections by Colonel Hanna as he thought it contained scenes with \"a tendency to bring the British army into contempt and ridicule\" and that \"no scene of cavalry charging the mob and causing 100 deaths….would be permissible on the screen\".[331]\\nShortly before Caine\\'s death in 1931, Metro Goldwyn Mayer purchased the screen rights of The Christian with the intention of making a talking picture.[332][333][334][335] The rights were reported as selling for £8000.\\nIn appearance Caine was a short man who tended to dress in a striking fashion. His eyes were dark brown and slightly protuberant, giving him an intense stare. He had red-gold hair and a dark red beard which he trimmed to appear like the Stratford bust of Shakespeare; indeed if people did not notice the likeness he was inclined to point it out to them.[336] He was also preoccupied throughout his life with the state of his health. This was often the result of overwork or other stresses in his life and he sometimes used nervous exhaustion as an excuse to escape from his problems.[337]\\nIn 1912, their son Derwent Hall Caine had an illegitimate daughter, Elin, and she was brought up as Caine and Mary\\'s child.[338] By 1914 Mary at last had her own house in London: Heath Brow, which overlooked Hampstead Heath. After the Great War this house had become too big, and Mary moved into Heath End House, again overlooking Hampstead Heath. By 1922 they were informally separated; Caine could not live with Mary, nor could he break with her completely.[339] From that time, they both suffered from various ailments.\\nOn 31 August 1931, aged\\xa078 Caine slipped into a coma and died at his home, Greeba Castle, Isle of Man. On his death certificate is the diagnosis of \"cardiac syncope\".[340] Following his death messages of condolence were received from the Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, King George V and Queen Mary.\\n[341]\\nAt Caine\\'s funeral on Friday 4 September 1931 representatives of all branches of public life in the Isle of Man followed the coffin. Sixty thousand Manx people and holiday makers paid tribute on the 25-mile journey. At Douglas great crowds lined the route and the majority of businesses closed. An address was made by the Bishop of Man. Caine was buried in Kirk Maughold churchyard.[342]\\n[343]\\nA memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London on 9 September 1931. Rev. R.J. Campbell gave the address. The Prime Minister was represented by Charles Patrick Duff, and A.J. Sylvester represented Lloyd George.\\nIn March 1932, six months after her husband\\'s death, Mary Hall Caine died from pneumonia. She was buried alongside her husband.\\nAn Irish limestone obelisk depicting six characters from Caine\\'s novels and a likeness of Mary was erected over their grave. The design is based on the ancient Maughold Parish Cross that is preserved in the churchyard.[344] The memorial is the work of artist Archibald Knox.\\nA statue of Hall Caine stands in Douglas, financed by money from the estate of Derwent Hall Caine.\\nHall Caine was an enormously popular and best-selling author in his time. Crowds would gather outside his houses hoping to get a glimpse of him.  He was \"accorded the adulation reserved now for pop stars and footballers\",[345] and yet today is virtually unknown.\\nAllen suggests two reasons for this: the first that, in comparison with Dickens, his characters are not clearly drawn, but are \"frequently fuzzy at the edges,\" while Dickens\\' characters are \"diamond-clear\"; and the second, that Caine\\'s characters also tend to be much the same.  Something similar could also be said about his plots. However, the main shortcoming may be that, although Caine\\'s novels can be romantic and emotionally moving, they are bereft of humour and, on the contrary, replete with a deadly earnestness.[346]\\nHall Caine Airport was an airfield on the Isle of Man which was located near Ramsey. It was named after the author by his sons Gordon Hall Caine and Derwent Hall Caine, who were the project initiators and Hall Caine Airport flourished for a short period prior to the outbreak of the Second World War.[352] From 1935 to 1937[352] it handled domestic scheduled passenger flights to English, Scottish and Irish airports. By 1937 it had fallen into disuse, primarily due to its location. Both Gordon Hall Caine and Derwent Hall Caine were particularly keen on the development of an aerodrome as they saw it as another bit of the island as being associated with their late father. They were said to be extremely interested in the progress of the Isle of Man and in particular its transport infrastructure. They also wished to include Ramsey\\'s municipal authority in the project, as they were both of the opinion that the aerodrome would bring immense benefit to the town.\\nThe final commercial flight from Hall Caine Airport departed at 16:15hrs on Saturday 2 October 1937.[353][354]\\nCaine wrote countless articles and stories of which an account has never been kept.[358]\\n',\n",

One of my greatest pleasures was, and still is, exploring London.\" —Eleanor Hibbert[4]\\n\"I found that married life gave me the necessary freedom to follow an ambition which had been with me since childhood; and so I started to write in earnest.\" —Eleanor Hibbert[4]\\n\"We spent the first night of our honeymoon in a country hotel, with Tudor architecture oak beams, and floors which sloped, of the Queen-Elizabeth-Slept-Here variety. There were old tennis-courts – the Tudor kind where Henry VIII was said to have played; and gardens filled with winter heather, jasmine and yellow chrysanthemums. [...] So that first night together was spent in the ancient bedroom with the tiny leaded paned windows, through which shafts of moonlight touched the room with a dreamlike radiance [...] \" —Eleanor Hibbert writing as Victoria Holt in The House of a Thousand Lanterns, 1974[5]\\nHibbert was born Eleanor Alice Burford on 1 September 1906 at 20 Burke Street, Canning Town, now part of the London borough of Newham.[6] She inherited a love of reading from her father, Joseph Burford, a dock labourer. Her mother was Alice Louise Burford, née Tate.\\nWhen she was quite young, bad health forced her to be privately educated at home. At the age of 16 she went to a business college, where she studied shorthand, typewriting, and languages. She then worked for a jeweller in Hatton Garden where she weighed gems and typed. She also worked as a language interpreter in a café for French and German-speaking tourists.[4]\\nIn her early twenties she married George Percival Hibbert (c. 1886–1966),[2][7] a wholesale leather merchant about twenty years older than herself, who shared her love of books and reading.[6] She was his second wife.[8] During World War II, the Hibberts lived in a cottage in Cornwall that looked out over a bay called Plaidy Beach.\\nBetween 1974 and 1978, Eleanor Hibbert bought a 13th-century manor house in Sandwich, Kent, that she named King\\'s Lodging because she believed that it had served previously as lodging for English monarchs Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.[7] The house had carved fireplaces and a staircase from the Tudor period.[9] Hibbert restored the house and furnished it opulently but soon found it too big for her taste and too far from London.[6]\\nShe then moved to a two-storey penthouse apartment at Albert Court, Kensington Gore, London, that overlooked the Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park.[4] She shared her apartment with Mrs. Molly Pascoe, a companion who also travelled with her.[10]\\nIn 1985, Hibbert sold King\\'s Lodging.[9][11]\\nHibbert spent her summers in her cottage near Plaidy Beach in Cornwall.[10] To get away from the cold English winter, Hibbert would sail around the world on board a cruise ship three months a year from January to April. The cruise would take her to exotic destinations like Egypt and Australia, locations that she later incorporated into her novels.[10][12] She sailed to Sydney aboard the cruise ship Oronsay in 1970, and the Canberra in 1978.[7]\\nTowards the end of her life, her eyesight started failing.[8]\\nEleanor Hibbert died on 18 January 1993 on the cruise ship Sea Princess somewhere between Athens, Greece and Port Said, Egypt and was buried at sea. A memorial service was later held on 6 March 1993, at St Peter\\'s Anglican Church, Kensington Park Road, London.[6]\\n\"When I was 14 and living in London, I\\'d go around Hampton Court Palace with its marvellous atmosphere, through the gateway where Anne Boleyn walked, the haunted gallery down which Katherine Howard ran. It all set me going, it all started from there.\" —Eleanor Hibbert[13]\\nEleanor Hibbert grew up in London. She first discovered her fascination for the past when she visited Hampton Court in her teenage years.[14] After her marriage, Hibbert achieved the financial independence she needed to realise her desire to write. London\\'s monuments and royal personalities filled Hibbert\\'s historical novels. She was also influenced by her regular visits to British historic homes and their architecture.[15]\\n\"I\\'ll sit in a room and think \\'This is where Charles I was when he was on the run.\\' I feel the atmosphere all around me, and that\\'s what I write about.\" —Eleanor Hibbert[15]\\nDuring World War II, the Hibberts lived in Cornwall, whose pebble beaches, high cliffs and treacherous blue waters served as the setting for many of the Victoria Holt gothic novels.[16]\\nIn later life, Hibbert took a world cruise every year.[7] Her ship called in ports of countries like Turkey, Egypt, India, South Africa, Hong Kong, Ceylon and Australia. These exotic destinations serve as the backdrop in later Victoria Holt novels. In the late 1960s, Hibbert spent two months visiting the Australian goldfields 40 miles north of Melbourne, research for her 1971 Victoria Holt novel, The Shadow of the Lynx.[17] In 1972, Hibbert travelled from Sydney to Melbourne via the Snowy Mountains and visited Hobart, Launceston, Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo.[10][12]\\n\"I love my work so much that nothing would stop me writing. I never think of the money I\\'m making. When I finish one book I start on the next. If I take even a week\\'s break I just feel miserable. It\\'s like a drug. —Eleanor Hibbert[10]\\n\"If anybody says to me \\'you look tired,\\' it\\'s because I haven\\'t been able to get at my typewriter. Writing excites me. I live all my characters and never have any trouble thinking of plots of how people would have said something because I\\'m them when I\\'m writing. —Eleanor Hibbert[9]\\nHibbert\\'s Philippa Carr novels were based partly in Cornwall and partly in Australia.\\nHibbert was influenced in her writing by the Brontës (especially the novel Jane Eyre), George Eliot, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, and Leo Tolstoy.[4]\\nDuring the 1930s, Hibbert wrote nine long novels (each about 150,000 words in length), all of them serious psychological studies of contemporary life.[18] However, none of these were accepted for publication. At the same time, she wrote short stories for newspapers including the Daily Mail and Evening News. Some also appeared in The Star, Woman\\'s Realm and Ladies\\' Home Journal. The turning point came when the fiction editor of the Daily Mail told her, \"You\\'re barking up the wrong tree: you must write something which is saleable, and the easiest way is to write romantic fiction.\"\\nHibbert read 50 romance novels as research and then published her first fiction book, Daughter of Anna, in 1941.[19] It was a period novel set in Australia of the late 18th and 19th centuries. It was a moderate success and Hibbert received £30 as advance for it. The book was published under her maiden name, Eleanor Burford, which was also used for her contemporary novels. Following the success of the book, Hibbert was contracted by Herbert Jenkins publishers to write one book a year. By 1961 Hibbert had published 31 novels under this name, including ten romance novels for Mills & Boon.\\nIn 1945, she chose the pseudonym Jean Plaidy for her new novel Together They Ride at the request of her agent.[14] The name was inspired by Plaidy Beach near the Hibberts\\' home in Looe, Cornwall during World War II.[16] Her agent suggested the first name, saying \"Jean doesn\\'t take much room at the back of the book\".[14] The book was published by Gerald G. Swan, a London publisher.[4] The next book written under the Jean Plaidy pseudonym was Beyond the Blue Mountains in 1948. The publisher Robert Hale accepted the 500-page manuscript after it had been rejected by several others. The firm wrote to Hibbert\\'s literary agency, A.M. Heath, \"Will you tell this author that there are glittering prizes ahead for those who can write as she does?\".[8] In 1949, Hibbert hit her stride with the first Jean Plaidy novel that fictionalized stories of royalty: The King\\'s Pleasure, featuring Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.[20] A total of 91 Jean Plaidy novels were published. Hibbert\\'s last Jean Plaidy book, The Rose Without a Thorn, was published posthumously.[4]\\nHibbert also wrote four non-fiction books under the pseudonym Jean Plaidy. The first, A Triptych of Poisoners (1958), was a collection of short biographies of poisoners: Cesare Borgia, Marie d\\'Aubray and Edward William Pritchard. The other three were a trilogy on the Spanish Inquisition: The Rise (1959), The Growth (1960) and The End (1961).\\nFrom 1950 to 1953, Hibbert wrote four novels as Elbur Ford, a pen name derived from her maiden name, Eleanor Burford. These novels were based on real-life murderers of the nineteenth century:  Edward William Pritchard (Flesh and the Devil, 1950); Adelaide Bartlett (Poison in Pimlico, 1950); Euphrasie Mercier[21] (The Bed Disturbed, 1952) and Constance Kent (Such Bitter Business, 1953 – published in the U.S. in 1954 under the title Evil in the House).\\nBetween 1952 and 1960, Hibbert used the pseudonym Kathleen Kellow to write eight novels that were mostly crime and mystery fiction. From 1956 to 1961, she wrote five novels as Ellalice Tate, a pseudonym inspired by her mother\\'s name, Alice Tate.[22]\\n\"I\\'ve always wanted to write a best-seller. Every writer does. It\\'s really a matter of finding out what the public wants. —Eleanor Hibbert[18]\\nIn 1960, at the suggestion of her agent, Patricia Schartle Myrer, she wrote her first Gothic romance, Mistress of Mellyn, under the name Victoria Holt. The pseudonym was created by choosing the name Victoria for its regal, romantic ring while the name Holt was taken from the military bank of Holt & Company where Hibbert had an account.[18][23] Published by Doubleday in the United States and Collins in the United Kingdom, Mistress of Mellyn became an instant international bestseller and revived the Gothic romantic suspense genre.[2][8][24][25]\\n\"I have heard her name mentioned in connection with mine and I think it is because we both lived in Cornwall and have written about this place. Rebecca is the atmospheric suspense type of book mine are. But I don’t think there is much similarity between her others and mine.\" —Daphne du Maurier commenting on the similarity between Victoria Holt\\'s novels and her own.[9]\\nMistress of Mellyn was a clever weaving of elements from earlier Gothic novels such as Jane Eyre (1847), The Woman in White (1859), and Rebecca (1938). Its setting in Cornwall made the resemblance to Rebecca (1938) so remarkable that it was speculated that Victoria Holt was a pseudonym for Daphne du Maurier.[15][26] After six Victoria Holt novels were published over eight years, it was revealed that Hibbert was the author.[9] Hibbert wrote a further 31 novels as Victoria Holt, primarily portraying fictitious characters set against an authentic period background, usually of the late 19th century. The last Victoria Holt novel, The Black Opal, was published after her death.[8]\\nIn 1960, Hibbert wrote a novel under the name Anna Percival, a pseudonym inspired by her husband\\'s middle name, Percival. Hibbert never used that pen name again.\\nShe created her last pseudonym, Philippa Carr, in 1972 at the suggestion of her publisher, Collins, to create a new series showing successive generations of English gentlewomen involved in important historical events starting with the Reformation and ending with World War II.[8]\\nHibbert continued to use the pseudonym Jean Plaidy for her historical novels about the crowned heads of Europe. Her books written under this pseudonym were popular with the general public and were also hailed by critics and historians for their historical accuracy, quality of writing, and attention to detail.[27]\\nNumber of books written per decade under different pseudonyms\\nHibbert based her research on the writings of British historians such as John Speed, James Anthony Froude, Alexander Fraser Tytler and Agnes Strickland.[4]\\nEach of Hibbert\\'s Jean Plaidy books featured a bibliography at the end, listing the historical works consulted during the process of writing the book.[28]\\nThe Kensington Central Library gave Hibbert special concessions to aid her research. She was allowed to go down to the vault where the out-of-circulation books were stored, and borrow them a trolley-load at a time.[10] She was even allowed to take the books home and keep them as long as she wanted.[9]\\nWhen her eyesight started failing towards the end of her life, she borrowed audiobooks from the Westminster City Council public libraries.[8]\\nHibbert was a prolific writer, churning out multiple books in a year under different pseudonyms, chiefly Jean Plaidy, Victoria Holt and Philippa Carr.[29][30] Jean Plaidy proved very popular in the United Kingdom, selling large quantities in paperback while Victoria Holt was a bestseller in the United States. Many of her readers never realized that behind all these pen names was a single author.[31][32][33]\\nHibbert attributed her large output to her regular working habits. She described herself as a compulsive writer and would write all seven days in the week. She started every morning at the typewriter on her desk, usually completing five thousand words by lunchtime.[19] Though writing stimulated her, she found the typewriter to be a physical strain. She devoted five hours every day to her writing, in addition to the time that it took her to proof-read her draft and conduct research. In the afternoon, she would personally answer all the fan mail she received. She would also spend time at Kensington Central Library. In the evening, she played chess if she could find an opponent or attended social engagements.[14]\\nEven while on her annual cruise around the world, Hibbert maintained her discipline. She wrote in the mornings, played chess in the afternoons, and joined in the shipboard entertainments in the evenings. She preferred to work on her Victoria Holt novels while on board the cruise ship because they did not require as much research or fact-checking at a library.[12]\\nEleanor Hibbert enjoyed healthy, lifelong relationships with her literary agents and publishers, a rare feat in the publishing world.[8] She was represented in the United Kingdom by A.M. Heath Literary Agency and by McIntosh & Otis in the United States. Her long-time American agent was Patricia Schartle Myrer followed by Julie Fallowfield.\\nLondon publisher Herbert Jenkins published 20 light romantic novels from 1941 to 1955 that Hibbert wrote under the pen name Eleanor Burford. The contract, initially for one book a year at an advance of £30 a title, was later revised to two books a year when the books proved successful.[4]\\nMills and Boon, a London publisher that specialised in low-priced, paperback, romantic novels brought out 10 romance novels from 1956 to 1962 that Hibbert wrote under the pen name Eleanor Burford.\\nGerald G Swan published the first Jean Plaidy book in 1945 but every one after that was published by Robert Hale. Starting with Beyond the Blue Mountains (1948) and extending over the entire course of her lifetime, Robert Hale published a total of 90 Jean Plaidy books in hardcover with dust jackets illustrated by specialist artist Philip Gough.[4]\\nMacRae Smith Co. of Philadelphia published Jean Plaidy titles in the United States. Foreign language editions of Jean Plaidy books began appearing in 1956: in French by Éditions Robert Laffont, Paris; in Spanish by Guillermo Kraft Limitada, Buenos Aires; and in Dutch by Uitgeverij A.J. Luitingh, Amsterdam.\\nIn 1951, Canadian paperback publishers Harlequin reprinted Jean Plaidy\\'s Beyond the Blue Mountains in paperback to achieve their greatest commercial success to that date: of the 30,000 copies sold, only 48 were returned.[34]\\nRobert Hale published eight Kathleen Kellow crime and mystery novels between 1952 and 1960 in hardcover with dust jackets by Philip Gough. Robert Hale also published the sole book written under the Anna Percival pseudonym, The Brides of Lanlory.[4]\\nFrom 1950 to 1953, four Elbur Ford crime novels were published by London publisher William Morrow in the United Kingdom and New York publisher Werner Laurie in the United States.\\nFrom 1956 to 1961, Hodder & Stoughton published all five historical novels written under the pseudonym Ellalice Tate.[4]\\nFrom 1960 to 1993, Hibbert wrote 32 Victoria Holt novels for the publishing giants Collins in the United Kingdom and Doubleday in the United States. Many of them were bestsellers and were translated into 20 languages to reach a worldwide audience.\\nFrom 1972 to 1993, Hibbert wrote 19 Philippa Carr novels that were published by Collins in the United Kingdom and Putnam in the United States. A few of them were later translated into foreign languages such as Spanish, Finnish, Russian and Polish.\\nBy the time of her death in 1993, Hibbert had sold 75 million books translated in 20 languages under the name Victoria Holt, 14 million under the name Jean Plaidy and 3 million under the name Philippa Carr.[2][35]\\nAfter her death, Mark Hamilton of the A.M. Heath Literary Agency took over as executor for her literary estate, estimated to be worth about £8,790,807 at probate.[6][36]\\nThe book The Love Child published in 1950 by Eleanor Burford must not be mistaken for the same-titled novel by Philippa Carr published in 1978 as part of the Daughters of England Series.[37]\\nMany Jean Plaidy books were published under different titles in the United States. Her trilogies were also later re-published as single books, often under different titles than those shown.\\nJean Plaidy historical novels were welcomed by readers who found them to be an easy way to gain insight into a sweeping panorama of European history.\\nIt was common for school girls in England to read these in history lessons, whilst hiding them behind their proper text books.\\nIn the last decade of the 20th century, historical fiction went out of fashion. Jean Plaidy titles went out of print.\\nIn October 2001, Rachel Kahan, associate editor at Crown Publishing Group, and Jean Plaidy fan since childhood, discovered that Jean Plaidy books had gone out of print in the United States.\\n\"I felt awful – like when you learn that an old friend who you haven\\'t seen for many years has suddenly died. But in this case, I was not just a fan mourning the loss of all those great novels, I was actually in a position to do something about it.\" —Rachel Kahan, on discovering in 2003 that Jean Plaidy books had gone out of print in the United States.[20]\\nKahan bought the reprint rights to ten Jean Plaidy novels. In April 2003, Crown chose to publish two books under the Three Rivers Press imprint, both featuring Henry VIII. The Lady in the Tower and The Rose Without a Thorn tell the story of two of his six wives, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, both of whom were beheaded. The books were published in paperback with new titles, modern covers and a readers\\' guide at the back. The first printing of 30,000 copies of each book sold out in 3 months. Based on this success, Crown\\'s United Kingdom unit, Arrow Books, bought the entire Jean Plaidy backlist.[38]\\nIn the Spring of 2003 Three Rivers Press, an imprint of U.S.A. publisher Crown Publishing Group, started republishing Jean Plaidy\\'s stories.[39][40] Three Rivers Press published some of the books with new titles which are listed here:\\nSome of these novels were re-published under the Jean Plaidy name.\\nAll these novels were later re-published under the Jean Plaidy name.\\nVictoria Holt books proved popular with the reading public and many of them made it to bestseller lists. Hibbert won loyalty from large numbers of women readers who passed along their copies to the next generation of women in their family. Hibbert described her heroines as \"women of integrity and strong character\" who were \"struggling for liberation, fighting for their own survival.\"\\n\"A Victoria Holt book is the sort of story to bring despair to literary critics, and rage to supporters of Women\\'s Lib though it would give a great deal of pleasurable entertainment to vast numbers of ordinary women all over the world.\" – a critic[13]\\nHer 1960 novel Mistress of Mellyn single-handedly revived the Gothic romance genre.[15] Many women started writing their own gothic romances. Even male authors like Tom E. Huff and Julian Fellowes succumbed to the trend and wrote romances under female pseudonyms.[42][43][44][45]\\nVictoria Holt novels became best-sellers. In 1970, when gothic mania was at its peak, The Secret Woman became one of the top 10 best-selling books in the United States.[46] By 1975, a Victoria Holt paperback began with a first printing of 800,000 copies.[47]\\nBy the early 1970s gothic novels outsold all other genres in paperback fiction, including mysteries, science fiction and Westerns. This coincided with consolidation within the publishing industry where paperbacks and hardcover publishers were brought together under the same corporate parent for the first time. More sophisticated marketing efforts led to placement in grocery and drugstore checkout aisles, where they found their target audience: educated, middle-class women with a reading habit.[48]\\nHibbert\\'s romance novels were clean; at the most the main characters exchanged smouldering looks of longing. However, by 1969 the sexual revolution had made explicit description more acceptable. In April 1972, the romance novel The Flame and the Flower took advantage of this change in trend and revolutionized the historical romance genre by detailing physical intimacy between the protagonists. Another such novel, Sweet Savage Love, that followed in 1974 cemented the trend. A new genre was thus born, dubbed the \\'sweet savage romance\\' or the \\'bodice ripper\\' because of the heaving, partly exposed bosom often pictured on the cover.[49][50]\\nInterest in Hibbert\\'s clean romances declined. In 1976, a critic complained that Victoria Holt\\'s heroines \"must be a little bit dumb or they won\\'t get themselves into such improbable messes in the first place.\"[51] The next Victoria Holt novel, The Devil on Horseback (1977), was described as \"from another era, sort of out of step with today\\'s style.\"[52] Critics judged the books as falling \"short of her previous standards.\"[53]\\n\"Today\\'s novels are \\'bodice rippers\\' and about as pure as driven slush.\" – a book critic in 1982[54]\\n\"In these books, innocent young virgins are carried off unwillingly by sensual, often primitive older men to picturesque lairs: by pirates to their galleons, Arabs to their harems, Indians to their tepees, knights to their castles. Early in the plot, the woman is ravished against her will and there is sex throughout the story.\" – a book critic describing the \\'bodice-ripper\\' type of romance novel in 1985[55]\\nBy the early 1980s, Gothic romances were no longer as popular as a decade earlier. Readers demanded more sex and adventure in their romance novels. Publishers created paperback imprints like Silhouette and Candlelight Ecstasy simply to satisfy the enormous demand for \"bodice rippers\" and \"hot historicals\".[54][56]\\nBowing to the changing times, Hibbert wrote The Demon Lover, a 1982 Victoria Holt novel, in a style that borrowed several elements from the plot of Sweet Savage Love: forced seduction of a naive girl by a powerful man ending in marriage, set against a background of turmoil in war time. Critics congratulated the move: \"Her latest, \\'The Demon Lover\\', is a straight romance with sexual passion, which is currently \\'in\\'. It has no suspense: the thrilling twists and turns of plot that marked her Gothic novels are no more.\"[57]\\nVictoria Holt\\'s heroines left the decorous drawing rooms of Victorian England to find adventure in far more exotic locations: inside an Egyptian pyramid (The Curse of the Kings, 1973); among Chinese antiques in Hong Kong (The House of a Thousand Lanterns, 1974);[58] down the opal mines of Australia (The Pride of the Peacock, 1976); on a tea plantation in Ceylon (The Spring of the Tiger, 1979);[59] among lush, tropical islands off the coast of Australia (The Road to Paradise Island, 1985);[60] in Crimea with Florence Nightingale (Secret for a Nightingale, 1986); in mutiny-filled British India (The India Fan, 1988); in a Turkish nobleman\\'s harem in Constantinople (The Captive, 1989);[61] in the British colonies of South Africa (Snare of Serpents, 1990); and on a shipwreck in the South Sea Islands (The Black Opal, 1993).\\nIn 1993, Hibbert died. In the closing years of the 20th century, Victoria Holt titles were made available in large print, audiobook and Braille formats. Translations in several European languages, Russian, Hebrew, Persian, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese also appeared.\\n\"Never regret. If it\\'s good, it\\'s wonderful. If it\\'s bad, it\\'s experience.\" —Eleanor Hibbert writing as Victoria Holt in The Black Opal, 1993.[62]\\nIn 2006, London publisher Harper reprinted four of Victoria Holt\\'s most popular titles with new covers: Mistress of Mellyn (1961), The Shivering Sands (1969), The Shadow of the Lynx (1971) and The Time of the Hunter\\'s Moon (1983). Foreign language translations in European languages, Japanese, Sinhalese and Thai were also published that year.\\n',\n",

Cartland is one of the best-selling authors worldwide of the 20th century.  \\nMany of her novels have been adapted into films for television including A Hazard of Hearts, A Ghost in Monte Carlo[2] and Duel of Hearts.[3]\\nHer novels have been translated from English into numerous languages, making Cartland the fifth most translated author worldwide, excluding biblical works.[4] Her prolific output totals some 723 novels[5]\\nAlthough best known for her romantic novels, she also wrote non-fiction titles including biographies, plays, music, verse, drama, operettas, and several health and cook books. She also contributed advice to TV audiences and newspaper magazine articles.[6]\\nShe sold more than 750 million copies of her books,[6] though other sources estimate her total sales at more than two billion.[7] The covers of her novels featured portrait-style artwork, usually designed by Francis Marshall (1901–1980).[8]\\nCartland was also a businesswoman who was head of Cartland Promotions. She was a London society figure, often dressed in a pink chiffon gown, a plumed hat, blonde wig, and heavy make-up.[6]\\nBorn at 31 Augustus Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, Cartland was the only daughter and eldest child of an Officer of the British Army, Major James Bertram \"Bertie\" Falkner Cartland[9] (1876–1918), and his wife, Mary Hamilton Scobell, known as \"Polly\" (1877–1976). Cartland had two brothers: Major Ronald Cartland, a Member of Parliament (MP) who served as a Army Major in World War II (1907–1940), and James Anthony \"Tony\" Hamilton Cartland (1912–1940). Both were killed in war conflict in Flanders.\\nThough she was born into upper middle-class comfort, the Cartland family\\'s finances rapidly deteriorated shortly after her birth. Cartland would later attribute this downturn to the suicide of her paternal grandfather, James Cartland, who, she stated, was a financier who shot himself in the wake of bankruptcy.[6] However, according to the entry in the probate registry, James Cartland, the proprietor of the brass foundry firm James Cartland & Son Ltd, left an estate of £92,000, suggesting that Barbara Cartland\\'s version of events is to a degree fanciful.[citation needed]\\nThis was followed soon afterwards by her father\\'s death in Berry-au-Bac in World War I. Cartland\\'s mother opened a London dry goods store to make ends meet, and to raise Cartland and her two brothers, both of whom were eventually killed in battle in 1940.[10]\\nCartland was educated at private girls\\' schools: The Alice Ottley School, Malvern Girls\\' College, and Abbey House, an educational institution in Hampshire. She became successful as a society reporter after 1922, and a writer of romantic fiction; she stated she was inspired in her early work by the novels of the Edwardian author Elinor Glyn, whom she idolised and eventually befriended.\\nAccording to an obituary published in The Daily Telegraph,[6] Cartland reportedly broke off her first engagement, to a Guards officer, when she learned about sexual intercourse. This claim fits with her image in later life as a representative of a generation for whom such matters were never discussed, but sits uneasily with her having produced work in the 1920s which was controversial at the time for its sexual subject matter.[citation needed] She claimed to have declined 49 marriage proposals[11] before marrying Captain Alexander \"Sachie\" George McCorquodale, on 23 April 1927, a British Army officer from Scotland and heir to a printing fortune. They divorced in 1933,[citation needed] and he died from heart failure in 1964.[6]\\nTheir daughter, Raine McCorquodale (9 September 1929 – 21 October 2016), who Cartland later alleged was the daughter of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 5th Duke of Sutherland, or Prince George, Duke of Kent, became \"Deb of the Year\" in 1947. After the McCorquodales\\' divorce in 1933, which involved charges and counter charges of infidelity, Cartland married her former husband\\'s cousin, Hugh McCorquodale, on 28 December 1936. Cartland and her second husband, who died in 1963, had two sons: Ian Hamilton McCorquodale (11 October 1937 - 10 February 2023),[1] a former Debretts publisher, and Glen McCorquodale (born 1939), a stockbroker.[10][6]\\nCartland maintained a long friendship with Lord Mountbatten of Burma, whose death in 1979 she said was the \"greatest sadness of my life\". Mountbatten supported Cartland in her various charitable works, particularly for United World Colleges, and even helped her write her book Love at the Helm, providing background naval and historical information. The Mountbatten Memorial Trust, established by Mountbatten\\'s great-nephew Charles, Prince of Wales, after Mountbatten was assassinated in Ireland, was the recipient of the proceeds of this book on its release in 1980.[citation needed]\\nWhen Cartland learned that young Diana Spencer loved reading her novels, Cartland began to send early copies.[12] However, as an adult, Diana, her step-granddaughter,[13] did not invite Cartland to her wedding to Prince Charles.[14] Cartland was later openly critical of Diana\\'s subsequent divorce, though the rift between them was mended shortly before Diana\\'s fatal car crash in Paris, in 1997.[citation needed] According to Tina Brown\\'s book on Diana, Cartland once remarked, \"The only books Diana ever read were mine, and they weren\\'t awfully good for her.\"[citation needed]\\nAfter a year as a gossip columnist for the Daily Express, Cartland published her first novel, Jigsaw (1923), a risqué society thriller that became a bestseller. She also began writing and producing somewhat racy plays, one of which, Blood Money (1926), was banned by the Lord Chamberlain\\'s Office. In the 1920s and 1930s, Cartland was a prominent young hostess in London society, noted for her beauty, energetic charm and daring parties. Her fashion sense also had a part, and she was one of the first clients of designer Norman Hartnell; she remained a client until he died in 1979. He made her presentation and wedding dresses; the latter was made to her own design against Hartnell\\'s wishes, and she admitted it was a failure.[citation needed]\\nIn 1950, Cartland was accused of plagiarism by author Georgette Heyer, after a reader drew attention to the apparent borrowing of Heyer\\'s character names, character traits, dialogue and plot points in Cartland\\'s early historical romances. In particular, A Hazard of Hearts (1949) replicated characters (including names) from Heyer\\'s Friday\\'s Child (1944) and The Knave of Hearts (1950) which, Heyer alleged, \"the conception\\xa0... , the principal characters, and many of the incidents, derive directly from an early book of my own, entitled These Old Shades, first published in 1926.\\xa0... For minor situations and other characters she has drawn upon four of my other novels.\" Heyer completed a detailed analysis of the alleged plagiarisms for her solicitors, but the case never came to court.[15]\\nAs well as writing novels, Cartland wrote a guide to married life in the 1950s, which was banned in Ireland.[16]\\nDespite their tame story lines, Cartland\\'s later novels were highly successful. By 1983, she rated the longest entry in Who\\'s Who (though most of that article was a list of her books), and she was named the top-selling author in the world by the Guinness Book of Records.[17] Additionally, in 1976, Cartland wrote 23 novels, earning her the Guinness World Record for the most novels written in a single year.[18] The 1970s and 1980s were her most prolific period; she also regularly appeared on television in that era.[19]\\nIn 2000, her publishers estimated that since her writing career began in 1923, Cartland had produced a total of 723 titles.[citation needed]\\nIn the mid-1990s, by which time she had sold over a billion books, Vogue called Cartland \"the true Queen of Romance\". She became a mainstay of the popular media in her trademark pink dresses and plumed hats, discoursing on matters of love, marriage, politics, religion, health, and fashion. She was publicly opposed to the removal of prayer from state schools, and spoke against infidelity and divorce, although she admitted to being acquainted with both of these subjects.[citation needed]\\nPrivately, Cartland took an interest in the early gliding movement and in 1931 created and devised a 200-mile (360\\xa0km) tow in a glider carrying mail. In 1984, she was awarded the Bishop Wright Air Industry Award for this contribution.[20]\\nShe regularly attended Brooklands aerodrome and motor-racing circuit during the 1920s and 30s, and the Brooklands Museum has preserved a sitting-room from that era and named it after her.\\nCartland wrote several biographies of major figures, including Metternich: The Passionate Diplomat in 1964, The Outrageous Queen: A Biography of Christina of Sweden in 1956, The Private Life of Charles II: The Women He Loved in 1958, and Josephine, Empress of France in 1961. Her biography of Klemens von Metternich focused on his many love affairs and contained passages such as: \"He was a virile, experienced and satisfying lover.... Even the most sophisticated women felt as if in his arms they learnt something they had never known before. Every woman rose with him to heights of emotional ecstasy beyond the power of expression.\"[21]\\nAfter the death of her brother Ronald Cartland during World War II, a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), Cartland published a biography of him with a preface by the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.\\nThe war marked the beginning of a lifelong interest in civic welfare and politics for Cartland, who served the War Office in various charitable capacities as well as the St John Ambulance Brigade. In 1953, she was invested at Buckingham Palace as a Commander of the Order of St John of Jerusalem for her services.\\nIn 1955, Cartland was elected a councillor on Hertfordshire County Council[10] as a Conservative and served for nine years. During this time she campaigned successfully for nursing home reform, improvement in the salaries of midwives and the legalisation of education for the children of Romani.\\nA radio operetta, The Rose and the Violet, broadcast by the BBC in 1942, was composed by Mark Lubbock with book and lyrics by Cartland. It was set against the Edwardian background of Rotten Row.[22]\\nCartland recorded an EP vinyl in conjunction with the Royal Philharmonic  Orchestra in 1978, titled An Album of Love Songs released through State Records, and produced by Norman Newell.[23] The album featured Cartland performing covers of a series of popular standards  including \"I\\'ll Follow My Secret Heart\" and \"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square\".[24]\\nIn January 1988, Cartland received the Médaille de Vermeil de la Ville de Paris, the highest honour of the city of Paris, for publishing 25 million books in France.\\nIn 1991, Cartland was invested by Queen Elizabeth II as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in honour of the author\\'s almost 70 years of literary, political, and social contributions.[25]\\nA waxwork of Cartland was on display at Madame Tussauds, though according to her son Ian, Cartland was displeased because it was not \"pretty enough\".[citation needed]\\nShe was the subject of This Is Your Life on two occasions, in March 1958 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre,[citation needed] and in December 1989, when Michael Aspel surprised her at Elstree Studios.[citation needed]\\nAs of 1996, Cartland holds the record for the most entries in the wider format of the biographic reference book Who\\'s Who, with an allocated 223 lines, surpassing that of former British PM Winston Churchill.[26]\\nThe former residence of Cartland, named River Cottage, and located in Great Barford, Bedfordshire in which she resided between 1941 until 1949, will be honoured with a heritage Blue Plaque\\nwhich is also a monument honouring her literary career.\\n[27]\\nCartland died in her sleep on 21 May 2000,[28] at her residence, Camfield Place, near Hatfield, Hertfordshire at the age of 98. She had been suffering from ill health and dementia for six months beforehand, and was subsequently bedridden and sequestered. Both of her sons, Ian and Glen McCorquodale, were present at her bedside when she died. Shortly afterwards, Cartland\\'s daughter from her first marriage, Raine, travelled to the family home.[29]\\nAfter Cartland originally had decided she would like to be buried in her local parish church, featuring a coffin of marble construction, covered in angels, this was later changed; she was buried in a cardboard coffin, because of her concerns for environmental issues.[30] She was interred at her private estate in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, under an oak that had been planted by Queen Elizabeth I.[31] Cartland left a gross estate of £1,139,123, but following debts and liabilities, the net sum was nil. She had once admitted: \"I have no idea what I make....Occasionally I ask, \\'Are we in debt?\\' We always are.\"[31]\\nCartland left behind a series of 160 unpublished novels, known as the Barbara Cartland Pink Collection. These were published in ebook format by her son, Ian McCorquodale; each month, a new novel was published from that collection until, in 2018, all 160 novels had been published.[32][33]\\nIn 2010, to mark the 10th anniversary of her death, Cartland\\'s first novel, Jig-Saw (first published in 1925), was reprinted.[34]\\n\"As a tribute to Her Majesty the Queen on her Diamond Jubilee and to Barbara\\'s enduring appeal to romantics everywhere, her publishers have re-released her catalogue collection, entitled – \"The Eternal Collection\".

       " 'Jayne Ann Krentz, née Jayne Castle (born March 28, 1948, in Cobb, California, United States), is an American writer of romance novels. Krentz is the author of a string of New York Times bestsellers under seven different pseudonyms. Now, she only uses three names. Under her married name she writes contemporary romantic-suspense. She uses Amanda Quick for her novels of historical romantic-suspense. She uses her maiden name for futuristic/paranormal romantic-suspense writing.\\nOver 35 million copies of Krentz\\'s novels are in print. With Sweet Starfire, she created the futuristic romance subgenre, and further expanded the boundaries of the genre in 1996 with Amaryllis, the first paranormal futuristic romantic suspense novel. She is an outspoken advocate for the romance genre and has been the recipient of the Susan Koppelman Award for Feminist Studies.\\nJayne Ann Castle was born on March 28, 1948, in Cobb, California, United States.[1] She and her two brothers were raised by their mother, Alberta, in Borrego Springs for the first decade of Jayne\\'s life.\\nShe earned a B.A in History at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1970.[2] Fearful that she would be unable to find a job using her degree, she elected to obtain her graduate degree in Library Science from San Jose State University. Immediately after graduation she married Frank Krentz, an engineer, whom she had met at San Jose State. The couple moved to the Virgin Islands, where Krentz worked for a year as an elementary school librarian, a time she refers to as \"an unmitigated career disaster\".[1] Realizing that she enjoyed being a librarian but not the aspects of teaching that working in an elementary school required, Krentz moved into the higher levels of academia, including a stint in the Duke University library system.[1] Krentz and her husband later moved to Seattle, Washington.\\nKrentz has been generous in sharing her wealth with libraries. She established the Castle Humanities Fund at UCSC\\'s University Library to allow the library to purchase additional books and has given money to 15 Seattle-area elementary schools to enhance their library budgets. She is also a member of the Advisory Board for the Writers Programs at the University of Washington extension program.[2][3]\\nWhile working at Duke, Krentz began writing stories her way, combining elements of romance novels with paranormal twists. For six years she wrote and mailed proposals for new novels, consistently receiving rejection letters.[1] She claims to have tried to stop writing several times during that period, but that it became a \"compulsion\".[3] During this time she and her family moved to Seattle, Washington to further her husband\\'s aerospace career.\\nKrentz continued writing, and, in 1979, she sold her first novel, Gentle Pirate.[1] That novel and several that followed were published within various category romance lines, as that was the only method in which contemporary romance was published. As more publishers began to release single-title contemporary romances, Krentz shifted into writing only single-title novels.[4]\\nHer first novels were released under her birth name, Jayne Castle. Krentz signed a contract allowing one of her publishers to own the name, and, after leaving that publisher, Krentz was unable to use that name on new works for ten years. This led to the creation of several pseudonyms, including Jayne Taylor, Jayne Bentley, Stephanie James and Amanda Glass. By the mid-1980s she had begun using only her married name, Jayne Ann Krentz, for all of her contemporary romance novels.[1]\\nHer 1986 novel, Sweet Starfire, was a futuristic romance, a subgenre that combined elements of romance novels and science fiction. The novel was a \"classic road trip romance\" which just happened to be set in a separate galaxy. In 1987 she published a second futuristic romance, Crystal Flame, which again allowed for a \"traditional romance plot unfold[ing] in an extraordinary world\".[5]\\nThe success of these books encouraged Krentz to try to write a real historical romance with a humorous twist, which she released under the pseudonym Amanda Quick.[5]\\nShe began writing paranormal futuristic novels of romantic suspense in 1996. Released under her maiden name, Jayne Castle, these novels are set far in the future in a world where everyone has a psychic talent and respectable people use marriage agencies instead of choosing their own mates. As is customary in her writing, in each case the protagonists have a mystery to solve or a villain to defeat.[6]\\nPsychic themes appear throughout Krentz\\'s work. In 2006 she began a new series, called The Arcane Society, which includes books written as Amanda Quick (historical setting), Jayne Ann Krentz (contemporary setting), and Jayne Castle (futuristic setting). The books tell the stories of members of the Arcane Society for the psychically gifted, and each hero and heroine has his or her own psychic power. The books feature a mystery for the protagonists to solve while they are learning to deal with their psychic abilities.[7] The heroes of her novels are always alpha males who are as strong and determined as her heroines.[8]\\nMore than 120 of Krentz\\'s romance novels have been published, with 32 placing on the New York Times Bestseller List. In total, there are over 23 million copies of her books in print.[3]\\nKrentz\\'s novel The Waiting Game was adapted for the Harlequin Romance Series teleplay in 2001.\\nHer books have won many awards. Krentz has been nominated 22 times for Romantic Times Reviewers\\' Choice Awards, winning in 1995 for Trust Me and in 2004 for Falling Awake.[9] She has also received a Romantic Times Career Achievement Award.[9]\\nAn outspoken advocate of the merits of romantic fiction, Krentz maintains that \"[p]opular fiction encapsulates and reinforces many of our most fundamental cultural values. Romance is among the most enduring because it addresses the values of family and human emotional bonds.\" To help educate the public about the genre she became the editor of and a contributor to Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women: Romance Writers on the Appeal of the Romance, a non-fiction essay collection that won the prestigious Susan Koppelman Award for Feminist Studies.[3] Krentz was the inspiration for, and first recipient of, the Romantic Times Jane Austen Award, created to \"honor those in the romance community who have significantly impacted our genre\".[10]\\n',\n",

Allen; Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Averil Ives, Anita Charles, Barbara Rowan, Jane Beaufort, Rose Burghley, Mary Whistler and Marguerite Bell. She has sold millions of copies over her 90-year career. She has been referred to as the \"world\\'s oldest novelist\" who was still active at 105 and continued writing until her death.[2] On the occasion of her 105th birthday, Pollock was appointed honorary vice-president of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association, having been one of its founding members.[3]\\nIda and her husband, Lt Colonel Hugh Alexander Pollock, DSO (1888–1971), a veteran of war and Winston Churchill\\'s collaborator and editor, had a daughter, Rosemary Pollock, who was also a romance writer. Ida\\'s autobiography, Starlight, published in 2009 at 100 years, tells the story of the start of her career, her marriage, and the relation of her husband with his ex-wife Enid Blyton. She was also an oil painter, who was selected for inclusion in a national exhibition in 2004, at the age of 96.[4]\\nBorn Ida Julia Crowe on 12 April 1908 in Lewisham, Kent, England,[5] she was the daughter of Fanny Osborn, whose father was an architect in Victorian London, and her husband Arthur Crowe, but Pollock claimed to be illegitimate.[6] Still unmarried, her mother began an affair with a supposed Russian duke, but, after her parents\\' death, her mother married Arthur Crowe, an old widower with a distant connection to Lord Nelson. A year or so later her mother resumed her affair with her Russian lover and became pregnant, but her daughter obtained her husband\\'s surname.[6] Her mother lived alone when Pollock was born, and she narrowly escaped being smothered with a pillow by the nurse who attended her birth.[7] Her mother had a difficult time raising her and she was almost adopted by a rich uncle.[6] Encouraged by her mother, she began to write while still at school. At 14, she published her first thriller, The Hills of Raven\\'s Haunt.[citation needed]\\nAt age 20, she was living with her mother in Hastings and already had several stories in major magazines and short novels in print.[8] She visited George Newnes\\'s office in London, to sell her first full-length manuscript;[7] Palanquins and Coloured Lanterns, a novel set in 1920s Shanghai.[8] Six months later, she discovered they had mislaid it.[9] After they found it, she returned to London to meet one of its editors, the 39-year-old Hugh Alexander Pollock (1888–1971), a distinguished veteran of World War I. Hugh had been married since 1924 to his second wife, the popular children\\'s writer Enid Blyton, and was divorced from his first wife, Marion Atkinson, with whom he had two sons, William Cecil Alexander (1914–16) and Edward Alistair (1915–69). George Newnes bought her manuscript and contracted with her to write two more novels.[7] She became a full-time writer in the 1930s, writing short stories under pseudonyms. Ida decided to travel alone to Morocco, after suffering a mental breakdown.[7]\\nDuring World War II, Ida worked at a hostel for girls in London during the Blitz; at this time Hugh, who had left publishing to join the Army, was Commandant of a school for Home Guard officers.[10] Hugh had two daughters with Enid Blyton, Gillian Mary (later Baverstock; 1931–2007) and Imogen Mary (later Smallwood; born 1935), but his marriage had difficulties and his wife began a series of affairs. He offered Ida a post as civilian secretary at the Army Training Centre in the Surrey Hills. During a bungled firearms training session on a firing range, Hugh was hit by shrapnel and Ida contacted Enid, who declined to visit her husband because she was busy and hated hospitals.[7]\\nIn 1941, Enid met Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters, a London surgeon with whom she began another relationship, and the marriage had broken down. In May 1942, while Ida was visiting her mother\\'s home in Hastings a bomb destroyed the house. She escaped unhurt, but her mother was in hospital for two weeks.[7] Hugh paid for Ida to stay at Claridges and he said he was divorcing his wife. To get a quick divorce, Hugh blamed himself for adultery at divorce petition. On 26 October 1943 Ida and Hugh were married at London\\'s Guildhall Register Office, six days after Enid\\'s marriage to Darrell Waters. In 1944 they had a daughter Rosemary Pollock who has also become a romance writer. Enid changed the names of their daughters and Hugh did not see them again, although Enid had promised access as part of his taking the blame for the divorce.[citation needed]\\nAfter World War II, George Newnes, Hugh\\'s old firm, decided not to work with him anymore. They also represented Enid Blyton and were not willing to let her go. After this the marriage experienced financial problems and, in 1950, Hugh had to declare bankruptcy while he struggled with alcoholism. Ida decided to write popular contemporary romances and sold her first novel to Mills & Boon in 1952. Being in print with several major international publishers at the same time, she decided to use multiple pseudonyms. In the 1950s she wrote as Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Rose Burghley, and Mary Whistler to Mills & Boon; as Averil Ives and Barbara Rowan to Ward Lock; as Anita Charles to Wright & Brown; and as Jane Beaufort to Collins. In 1964, she published under her married name, Ida Pollock, her first historical novel, The Gentle Masquerade, and after the success of it, Mills and Boon\\'s \"Masquerade\" series of historical romances was launched.[8] Under her last pseudonym, Marguerite Bell, she also wrote historical romances. Most of her novels have been reprinted by Mills & Boon (or Harlequin in the United States).\\nDuring her marriage she travelled widely and lived in many parts of England. It was their daughter\\'s asthma that brought the Pollocks to Cornwall. They also lived in Ireland, France, Italy, Malta and Switzerland, where they successfully obtained a lasting cure for Rosemary\\'s debilitating condition.[7] Hugh died on 8 November 1971 in Malta, where he is buried in the British military cemetery. After her husband\\'s death, Pollock returned with her daughter to England and they lived for several years in Wiltshire, before moving to Lanreath in 1986. In the 1970s she slowed the rhythm of publication, but continued to write. Besides romances, she published – as Barbara Rowan – a suspense novel, and her novel, A Distant Drum (2005), is based around the Battle of Waterloo. She has been referred to as the \"world\\'s oldest novelist\" who was still active at 105.[11] After her death, her medieval story: Sir Faintheart was published in 2015, and there are still at least two unpublished Regency romances pending publication, including The Runaway.[2]  Today many of her old novels are being reedited.\\nIn addition to writing, Ida constructed model houses, usually scale miniatures of Georgian or Tudor buildings.

She wrote under her first married name and under the pen-names: Denise Chesterton, Eve Vaill, \\'Anne Llewellyn\\', Hervey Hamilton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray and Julia Kane, producing short stories, plays, and about 170 Gothic romance novels. In 1965, Robins published her autobiography, Stranger Than Fiction. At the time of her death in 1985, Robins\\'s books had been translated into fifteen languages and had sold more than one hundred million copies. In 1984, they were borrowed more than one and a half million times from British libraries.[2]\\nShe was the daughter of the novelist K. C. Groom, and mother of romance novelist Patricia Robins. Some other members of her family are well-known artists.\\nRobins was born Denise Naomi Klein on 1 February 1897 in London, England, the daughter of Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell, who was also a prolific author who wrote under several names, and of her first husband, Herman Klein, who was a professor of music and journalist. Of Russian Jewish ancestry, he had been born in Norwich in 1856. Her mother Kathleen Clarice had been born in Melbourne, Australia, on 11 March 1872 and was the daughter of George Cornwell and his wife Jemima Ridpath, married in 1850.[3] George Cornwell was a railway guard who became a successful gold prospector in Australia, operating several mines, and a notable building contractor. His eldest daughter, Alice Cornwell, born 1852, was spectacularly rich by the 1890s, returning to England and buying the Sunday Times newspaper.[4][5]\\nHer parents had married in 1890. He had a daughter Sibyl Klein, from a previous marriage, and they had two sons: Adrian Bernard Klein (1892–1969) and Daryl Klein (1894), before the birth of Denise Naomi Klein (1897–1985). The childhood of Denise, Adrian and Daryl Klein was far from settled. Kathleen Klein began an affair with a Worcestershire Regiment officer called Herbert Berkeley Dealtry, who was much younger than her husband, and little than herself, and when Hermann Klein became aware of it he filed a petition for divorce, which was granted in December 1901. Kathleen then married Dealtry.[4]\\nIn 1905, the Dealtrys had some serious troubles in connection with the promotion of dog shows, which they had been drawn into by Kathleen\\'s sister Alice Stennard Robinson, a leading member of the Ladies\\' Kennel Association (founded 1904) and the National Cat Club. Somehow, the money from the first dog show went missing, and the Dealtrys held a second show to pay the prize money owed on the first. After the second show, prize winners sued Dealtry, which led to his being declared bankrupt.[4] The family then lived in America for a few years but, by 1908, Kathleen (or \\'Kit\\') Dealtry was back in London, writing Christian novels.[6] In 1918 she married for a third time and wrote at least three books[7] as Mrs Sydney Groom.[4]\\nHer eldest brother Adrian Bernard Klein also became a writer, he was an artist and wrote books on photography and cinematography. After serving as an officer in the British Army, he became a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and changed his name to Adrian Cornwell-Clyne.[4]\\nDenise Naomi Klein married firstly Arthur Robins in 1918, a corn broker on the Baltic Exchange,[8] they had three daughters, Eve Louise, Patricia Robins (a.k.a. Claire Lorrimer) who became another best-selling author, and Anne Eleanor.[8] In 1938, the marriage ended in divorce, after Robins met O\\'Neill Pearson in Egypt,[9] they married in 1939. However, like Agatha Christie, Robins continued to publish most of her books under her first married name.[1]\\nWhen she left school, Denise Klein went to work as a journalist for the D. C. Thomson Press, then became a freelance writer. She began to follow in her mother\\'s footsteps when her first novel was published in 1924. Her serial What is Love? ran in The Star from December 1925 to February 1926.[10] Her first play, Heatwave, written in collaboration with Roland Pertwee, was produced at the St James\\'s Theatre, London, in 1929.[11] As a writer of fiction, Denise Klein wrote under a variety of pen-names, including Denise Chesterton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray, Hervey Hamilton and Julia Kane.[1] After marrying Arthur Robins, many of her books were written under her married name.[11]\\nRobins had been writing fiction and getting it published for ten years when in 1927 she met Charles Boon, of Mills & Boon, and she entered her first contract with his firm the same year. Under the terms of this, she was to be paid an advance of thirty pounds for three novels, plus ten per cent terms. Her next contract, for a further six books, delivered an advance of twenty-five pounds for each book, while her third contract, for four more books, paid one hundred pounds for each, plus terms of twelve and a half per cent.[12]\\nThe colourful dust wrappers of Mills & Boon\\'s books were becoming one of their biggest selling points. As an example, the cover of Robins\\'s Women Who Seek (1928) showed a glamorous flapper checking her make-up.[13]\\n\\nRobins became not only Mills & Boon\\'s most prolific writer, but also their best paid. A contract she signed in 1932 paid her £2,400 for eight books, which were those from Shatter the Sky (July 1933) to How Great the Price (June 1935). This was, however, her last work for the firm, as she was then \\'poached\\' by a new publisher, Nicholson & Watson.[14] Of this development, Arthur Boon wrote:[14] Denise Robins, one of our greatest authors, knew she could sell on her name more than other authors could. She was a superstar, and she knew it. Our problem was to find a way to satisfy the superstar. What could Mills & Boon offer a superstar? Superstars weren\\'t grateful.\\nRobins gave her version of events in her autobiography:[11][14] Suddenly a young man named Ivor Nicholson came along – a clever, charming journalist who, with the wealth of Bernard Watson to back his new venture, launched a new publishing house – Ivor Nicholson & Watson. They wanted my name on their list. They tempted me with what was the biggest offer I had ever received from any literary quarter, a cheque for one thousand pounds, free, gratis, and for which I need do no work. It was merely for signing the contract! I did not go behind Charles Boon\\'s back. I told him the facts. Unfortunately he was so annoyed by Ivor Nicholson\\'s offer that he refused to compete and at once released me from my contract with his firm. Somewhat reluctantly I left my old publishers and became the new Nicholson & Watson \\'star\\' author.The first book Robins wrote for Nicholson was Life and Love (1935), which was launched with a huge publicity campaign. Robins\\'s first photo opportunity was a visit to Liverpool to open a new lending library, and the slogan \\'Robins for Romance\\' was posted on London buses.[14]\\nJoseph McAleer has described Robins as \"the recognised mistress of the punishing kiss device.[15]\\nDuring her long career as a writer, from about 1917 until her death in 1985, Robins certainly wrote more than one hundred and sixty books. She was dubbed by the Daily Graphic \"the queen of romantic fiction\".[4]\\nShe was elected as President of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association in 1961.[9]\\nIn 1965, Robins published her autobiography, Stranger Than Fiction, summarised thus: \"Apart from writing nearly two hundred novels that have brought her millions of fans throughout the world, Denise Robins led a remarkable life. Her unhappy childhood did not sour her belief in love. Here is her own story.\"[16][17]\\nAt the time of her death in 1985, Robins\\'s books had been translated into fifteen languages and had sold more than one hundred million copies. In 1984, they were borrowed more than one and a half million times from British libraries. Among her best-selling works were House of the Seventh Cross, Khamsin and Dark Corridor.[2] In October 2011 the first dozen of her novels were released in e-book format.[18]\\nSome of her novels have been reedited under different titles or as Denise Robins[17]\\n',\n",

This novel was Collins\\'s first foray into the world of organized crime, a genre that would later prove to be extremely successful for her.[24]\\nFollowing this, Collins published The World Is Full of Divorced Women (unrelated to her first novel) in 1975, and then Lovers & Gamblers in 1977, which told the story of rock/soul superstar Al King.[25]\\nIn the late 1970s, Collins made a foray into writing for the screen. She co-wrote the screenplay for The Stud (1978), based on her second book; the film starred her older sister Joan as the gold-digging adulteress Fontaine Khaled. Following this, Collins wrote the screenplay for The World Is Full of Married Men (1980), the film adaptation of her first novel.[26] She also released her seventh novel, The Bitch (1979), a sequel to The Stud; The Bitch was also made into a successful 1979 film, with Joan Collins reprising the role.[27] Around the same time, Collins wrote an original screenplay (not based on any of her novels) for the film Yesterday\\'s Hero (1979).[28]\\nThere are so many bad boys out there, especially in Hollywood.

With age comes experience.\\n—Jackie Collins[29]\\nIn the 1980s, Collins and her family moved to Los Angeles on a full-time basis, where she would continue to write about the \"rich and famous\". She said, \"If you wish to be successful, there is a place you should be at a certain time. And Los Angeles in the 1980s was it.\"[30]\\nHer next novel was Chances (1981). It introduced one of her best-known characters, Lucky Santangelo, the \"dangerously beautiful\" daughter of a gangster.[31]\\nWhile living in the hills above Sunset Boulevard, Collins collected the knowledge and experience to write her most commercially successful novel, Hollywood Wives (1983), which hit The New York Times best-seller list at number one. Marketed as a \"scandalous exposé\", the novel sold over 15 million copies[32] and placed Collins in a powerful position, making her a celebrity of near equal status to her sister Joan, whose own career had taken an upwards direction with her role in the television drama Dynasty.[citation needed]\\nIn 1985, Hollywood Wives was made into a television miniseries, produced by Aaron Spelling and starring Candice Bergen, Stefanie Powers, Angie Dickinson, Anthony Hopkins, Suzanne Somers, and Rod Steiger. Although credited as a \"creative consultant\", Collins later stated that she was never consulted during production and that she did not agree with some of the casting choices.[33]\\nShe then went on to write the sequel to Chances, titled Lucky (1985),[34] followed by Hollywood Husbands  (1986) and Rock Star (1988).[19]\\nIn 1990, Collins published her third Lucky Santangelo novel, Lady Boss, and wrote and co-produced the television miniseries Lucky Chances, which combined her first two Lucky Santangelo novels and starred Nicollette Sheridan (in the lead role) and Sandra Bullock.[35]\\nIn 1992, Collins was widowed when her husband of 26 years, Oscar Lerman, died of cancer.[36] Around this time, she wrote and produced another miniseries based on the Lady Boss novel, with Kim Delaney playing the lead role. Collins\\'s run of best-sellers continued with American Star (1993), Hollywood Kids (1994), and the fourth Santangelo novel, Vendetta: Lucky\\'s Revenge (1996).\\nShe was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1993, when she was surprised by Michael Aspel.[citation needed]\\nIn 1998, she made a foray into talk show television with the series Jackie Collins\\' Hollywood, but this was unsuccessful. She also published the novel Thrill (1998) and wrote a four-part series of mini-novels, called L.A. Connections, to be released in a newspaper every six weeks and which introduced a new heroine in the form of investigative journalist Madison Castelli.[37] The fifth Lucky Santangelo novel, Dangerous Kiss, was published in 1999.[38]\\nThe 2000s turned out to be Collins\\'s busiest time; she published eight best-sellers, more than in any other decade in her career. In 2000, Collins brought back the character of Madison Castelli in a new novel, Lethal Seduction. In 2001, she published Hollywood Wives: The New Generation, which was adapted as a 2003 television movie starring Farrah Fawcett, Melissa Gilbert, and Robin Givens. (Collins was credited as an executive producer.) A new Madison Castelli novel, Deadly Embrace, was published in 2002, and Hollywood Divorces was published in 2003. In 2004, Collins hosted a series of television specials, Jackie Collins Presents, for E! Entertainment Television.[39]\\nCollins continued with Lovers & Players (2006); the sixth Lucky Santangelo novel, Drop Dead Beautiful (2007); and  Married Lovers (2008), which concerns the affairs of a female personal trainer named Cameron Paradise.[40] This was followed by Poor Little Bitch Girl (2009), which stemmed from an idea Collins had worked on for a television series about heiresses that was ultimately never made.[41]\\nParis Connections (2010), a direct-to-DVD movie adapted from Collins\\'s L.A. Connections series of mini-novels, was made by Amber Entertainment in association with the UK supermarket chain Tesco. The movie stars Charles Dance, Trudie Styler, and Nicole Steinwedell (as Madison Castelli). Collins served as co-producer, and three more Connections movies with the Madison Castelli character are planned.[42]\\nCollins continued to write Lucky Santangelo books, including Goddess of Vengeance.[43] Her 29th novel, titled The Power Trip, was published in February 2013.[44] Confessions of a Wild Child, was published in February 2014, with a movie deal announced even before the book came out.[45]\\nCollins\\'s cookbook, The Lucky Santangelo Cookbook (2014), is named after the protagonist of nine Collins novels, who is often portrayed preparing elaborate gastronomic creations for her intimates (and who watched her father throw a plate of food at her mother as a child).[46]  Collins\\'s final novel was The Santangelos (2015), a conclusion to the Santangelo series she had begun with Chances (1981).[47]\\nCollins held dual citizenship: British (by birth) and U.S. (by naturalization, from 6 May 1960).[48] She married her first husband, Wallace Austin, in 1960; they divorced in 1964. Austin\\'s addiction to drugs prescribed for manic depression ultimately caused their separation, and he died from a deliberate overdose the year after their marriage ended.[2][10] The couple had one daughter, Tracy, born in 1961.[48]\\nIn 1965, Collins married again, this time to American art gallery and nightclub (Ad-Lib and Tramp) owner, Oscar Lerman, who was 18 years her senior.[49] The wedding took place in the home of her sister Joan and her husband at the time, Anthony Newley. Collins and Lerman had two daughters, Tiffany (born 1967) and Rory (born 1969). Lerman also formally adopted Collins\\'s daughter, Tracy, from her previous marriage. Lerman died in 1992 from prostate cancer.[48]\\nIn 1994, Collins became engaged to Los Angeles business executive Frank Calcagnini, who died in 1998 from a brain tumor. She said that what got her through the tragedies of losing two loved ones was \"celebrating their lives, as opposed to dwelling on their deaths.\"[29]\\nIn 2011, when asked if she were dating anyone, Collins said: \"I have a man for every occasion\", adding:\\nWhen I was a kid growing up, I used to read my father\\'s Playboy and I\\'d see these guys and they had fantastic apartments and cars. I have all of that now. Why would I want to hook myself up with one man when I\\'ve had two fantastic men in my life? One was my husband for over 20 years and one was my fiancé for six [sic] years.[50]She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to fiction and charity.[51][52]\\nThroughout Collins\\'s career, she fictionalized aspects of her personal life as a source for her novels. She said she loved Los Angeles and recalled that while growing up in England, she often read novels by Harold Robbins, Mickey Spillane, and Raymond Chandler.[18] Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne explains that Collins \"loved the picture business, the television business, the record business, and the people in them, the stars, celebrities, directors, and producers.\"[18] And although she was a \"great partygoer\", he says, she went to them \"more as an observer than participant\", using them as part of her \"research.\"[18] \"Write about what you know\", Collins said at a writer\\'s conference. \"I love what I do. I fall in love with my characters. They become me, and I become them.\"[18]\\nCollins died on 19 September 2015, of breast cancer.[53] She had been diagnosed with stage-4 breast cancer more than six years before her death but kept her illness almost entirely to herself. She reportedly informed her sister Joan Collins two weeks before she died[54] and flew from Los Angeles to London to appear on the ITV chat show Loose Women nine days before her death.[55][56]\\nSource[57]\\n',\n",

       " '\\nDame Catherine Ann Cookson, DBE (née McMullen; 20 June 1906 – 11 June 1998) was a British writer. She is in the top 20 of the most widely read British novelists, with sales topping 100 million, while she retained a relatively low profile in the world of celebrity writers. Her books were inspired by her deprived youth in South Shields (historically part of County Durham), North East England, the setting for her novels. With 104 titles written in her own name or two other pen names, she is one of the most prolific British novelists.\\nCookson, registered as Catherine Ann Davies, was born on 20 June 1906[1][2] at 5 Leam Lane[3] in Tyne Dock, South Shields, County Durham, England. She was known as \"Katie\" as a child.[4] She moved to East Jarrow, which would become the setting for one of her best-known novels, The Fifteen Streets. The illegitimate child of an alcoholic named Kate Fawcett, she grew up thinking her unmarried mother was her sister, as she was brought up by her grandparents, Rose and John McMullen.[5] Biographer Kathleen Jones tracked down her father, whose name was Alexander Davies, a bigamist and gambler from Lanarkshire, Scotland.[6]\\nShe left school at 14 and, after a period of domestic service,[7] took a laundry job at Harton Workhouse[5] in South Shields. In 1929, she moved south to run the laundry at Hastings Workhouse, saving every penny to buy a large Victorian house, and then taking in lodgers to supplement her income.[6]\\nIn June 1940, at the age of 34, she married Tom Cookson, a teacher at Hastings Grammar School. After experiencing four miscarriages[8] late in pregnancy, it was discovered she was suffering from a rare vascular disease,[4] telangiectasia, which caused bleeding from the nose, fingers and stomach and resulted in anaemia. A mental breakdown followed the miscarriages, from which it took her a decade to recover.[6]\\nShe took up writing as a form of therapy, in order to tackle her depression, and became a founding member of the Hastings Writers\\' Group. Her first novel, Kate Hannigan, was published in 1950.[9] Though it was labelled a romance novel, she expressed discontent with the stereotype. Her books were, she said, historical novels about people and conditions she knew. Cookson had little connection with the London literary circus.[citation needed]\\nCookson wrote almost 100 books, which sold more than 123 million copies, her novels being translated into at least 20 languages. She also wrote books under the pseudonyms Catherine Marchant[10] and a name derived from her childhood name, Katie McMullen.[11] She remained the most borrowed author from public libraries in the UK for 17 years,[12] up until four years after her death, losing the top spot to Jacqueline Wilson only in 2002.[13]\\nMany of Cookson\\'s novels have been adapted for film, radio, and the stage. The first film adaptation of her work was Jacqueline (1956), directed by Roy Ward Baker, based on her book A Grand Man.[14]\\nIt was followed by Rooney (1958), directed by George Pollock, based on her book Rooney. Both starred John Gregson. For commercial reasons, the action of both films was transferred from South Shields to Ireland.[15]\\nIn 1983 Katie Mulholland was adapted into a stage musical by composer Eric Boswell and writer-director Ken Hill. Cookson attended the première.[16]\\nIt was on television, however, that she had her greatest media success, with a series of dramas that appeared over the course of a decade on ITV and achieved huge ratings. Eighteen books were adapted for television between 1989 and 2001.[6] They were all produced by Ray Marshall from Festival Film & TV who was given permission by Cookson in 1988 to bring her works to the screen. The first film to be made, The Fifteen Streets[17] starring Sean Bean and Owen Teale, was nominated for an Emmy award in 1990. The second production, The Black Velvet Gown,[18] won an International Emmy for Best Drama in 1991. The mini series regularly attracted audiences over 10 million and are still showing in the UK on Drama and the Yesterday Channel.\\nIn 1985, she pledged more than £800,000 to the University of Newcastle. In gratitude, the university set up a lectureship in hematology. Some £40,000 was given to provide a laser to help treat bleeding disorders and £50,000 went to create a new post in ear, nose and throat studies, with particular reference to the detection of deafness in children. She had already given £20,000 towards the university\\'s Hatton Gallery and £32,000 to its library. In recognition of this generosity, a building in the university medical faculty has been named after her.[19] Her foundation continues to make donations to worthy causes in the UK, particularly those offering services to young people and cultural ventures, such as the Tyneside Cinema.[20]\\nShe was created an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1985, and was elevated to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1993.[21]\\nCookson received the Freedom of the Borough of South Tyneside, and an honorary degree from the University of Newcastle.[22] The Variety Club of Great Britain named her Writer of the Year, and she was voted Personality of the North East.\\nShe was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1982 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.[23]\\nIn later life, Cookson and her husband Tom returned to the North East and settled first in Haldane Terrace, Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne. They then moved to Corbridge, a market town near Newcastle, and later to Langley, Northumberland,[22] a small village nearby. As her health declined, they moved for a final time, back to Jesmond in 1989 to be nearer to medical facilities.[6] For the last few years of her life she was bed-ridden,[24] and she gave her final TV interview to North East Tonight, the regional ITV Tyne Tees news programme, from her sickbed. It was conducted by Mike Neville.\\nCookson died at the age of 91, nine days before her 92nd birthday, at her home in Newcastle. Her novels, many written from her sickbed, continued to be published posthumously until 2002. Her husband Tom died just 17 days later, on 28 June 1998.[25] He had been hospitalised for a week and the cause of his death was not announced. He was 86 years old.\\nIn 1992 the inaugural Catherine Cookson Prize took place and was won by author Val Wood and her debut novel, The Hungry Tide, which subsequently went on to become a best-seller. \\nIn March 2008, the Dame Catherine Cookson Memorial Garden was unveiled in the grounds of South Tyneside District Hospital in South Shields, based on the theme of a serpentine symbol, commonly used to symbolise health and caring. The hospital occupies the site of the Harton Workhouse, where Cookson worked from 1924 to 1929. The project was partly funded by the Catherine Cookson Trust.[26]\\nTom and Catherine, a musical about the couple\\'s life, was written by local playwright Tom Kelly. It played to sell-out crowds at the Customs House in South Shields.\\nCookson was portrayed by actress Kerry Browne in the 2018 award-winning film Our Catherine, co-written by Tom Kelly.\\nAll titles from The Mallens onwards have been released on DVD in the UK and various other countries.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nJilly Cooper, CBE (born 21 February 1937), is an English author. She began her career as a journalist and wrote numerous works of non-fiction before writing several romance novels, the first of which appeared in 1975. She is most famous for writing the Rutshire Chronicles.\\nJilly Sallitt was born in Hornchurch, Essex, England, to Mary Elaine (née Whincup) and Brigadier W. B. Sallitt, OBE.[2] She grew up in Ilkley and Surrey, and was educated at the Moorfield School in Ilkley and the Godolphin School in Salisbury.[2]\\nAfter unsuccessfully trying to begin a career in the British national press, Cooper became a junior reporter for The Middlesex Independent, based in Brentford. She worked for the paper from 1957 to 1959. Subsequently, she worked as an account executive, copywriter, publisher\\'s reader and receptionist.\\nHer break came with a chance meeting at a dinner party. The editor of The Sunday Times Magazine, Godfrey Smith, asked her to write a feature about her experiences.[3] This led to a column in which Cooper wrote about marriage, sex and housework. That column ran from 1969 to 1982, when she moved to The Mail on Sunday, where she worked for another five years.\\nCooper\\'s first column led to the publication of her first book, How to Stay Married, in 1969, and which was quickly followed by a guide to working life, How to Survive from Nine to Five, in 1970. Some of her journalism was collected into a single volume, Jolly Super, in 1971.\\nThe theme of class dominates much of her writing and her non-fiction (including Class itself), which is written from an explicitly upper-middle-class British perspective, with emphasis on the relationships between men and women, and matters of social class in contemporary Britain.\\nShe was in favour of the Iraq War.[4]\\nAs with her non-fiction works, Cooper draws heavily on her own point of view and experiences. For example, her own house is the model for Rupert Campbell-Black\\'s. Both houses are very old, although his is larger;[5] her house overlooks a valley called Toadsmoor, while his overlooks a valley called the Frogsmore. She also draws on her love of animals:[6] dogs and horses feature heavily in her books. Woods, hills, fields, pastures and rivers feature frequently.\\nIn 1975, Cooper published her first work of romantic fiction, Emily. It was based on a short story she wrote for a teenage magazine, as were the subsequent romances, all titled with female names: Bella, Imogen, Prudence, Harriet and Octavia. In October 1993, seven years after Private Eye had pointed out the similarities, Cooper admitted that sections of Emily and Bella were plagiarised from The Dud Avocado by Elaine Dundy, but said that it was not deliberate.[7]\\nOctavia is one of Cooper\\'s \"name\" books, which each bear a female character\\'s name, and has been made into a television adaptation. It is set in Britain during the 1970s.[8] The broadcast ITV adaptation was produced with a screenplay which was written by Jonathan Harvey.[9]\\nOne character was modelled on George Humphreys, a Welshman with whom Cooper had an affair in the late 1950s.[10]\\nThe Times noted that Cooper avoids the traditional romantic convention in which the heroine remains a virgin until the last page. Elizabeth Grey found the jokes annoying but still funny, and confessed to falling in love with the character of Octavia.[11]\\nAn excerpt was included in The Dirty Bits For Girls (ed. India Knight, Virago, 2008), a collection of favourite \"dirty bits\" from novels Knight read as a teenager.[12]\\nOctavia Brennan is a beautiful yet flawed young woman, living the high life in 1970s London. Though she is deeply flirtatious and has – by her own admission – slept with many men, she has never found happiness with any of them.\\nAfter bumping into an old school friend, Gussie, and falling for her fiancé, Jeremy, Octavia is invited to spend the weekend with them on their canal boat. Characteristically, she convinces herself that Jeremy cannot possibly have real affection for the overweight and clumsy Gussie, and she is determined to win Jeremy by the end of the weekend. But when Jeremy invites Welsh firebrand Gareth Llewellyn along for the ride, Octavia finds her plans disrupted in more ways than one.\\nProduction began on 17 September 2007, in London.[13] Cooper was invited to make a cameo appearance as a guest at a party.[14] Its broadcast was delayed according to a Broadcast Now article in early 2009 as a consequence of the recession – ITV put many of their dramas \\'on ice\\'; postponing single dramas until later that year.[15] The Guardian reported early in 2009 Octavia had no transmission slots for the forthcoming year and said, for accountancy purposes, its cost would not be counted until the show was broadcast.[16] Octavia had its first UK screening in 2009 with Tamsin Egerton taking the title role.\\nThe cast was:\\nHowever, Cooper\\'s best-known works are her long novels. The first of these was Riders (1985), an international bestseller, and the first volume of Rutshire Chronicles. The first version of Riders was written by 1970, but shortly after Cooper had finished it, she took it with her into the West End of London and left the manuscript on a bus. The London Evening Standard put out an appeal, but it was never found. She was, she says, \"devastated\", and it took her more than a decade to start it again.[17]\\nRiders and the following books are characterised by intricate plots, featuring multiple story lines and a large number of characters. (To help the reader keep track, each book begins with a list and brief description of the characters.) Although the books do not always follow each other sequentially – Rivals and Polo chronologically overlap, for example – they are linked by recurring characters (chiefly Rupert Campbell-Black, Roberto Rannaldini, and their families) and later books make reference to events of previous books.\\nThe stories heavily feature sexual infidelity and general betrayal, melodramatic misunderstandings and emotions, money worries and domestic upheavals.[18]\\nEach book of the Rutshire Chronicles is set in a glamorous and wealthy milieu, such as show jumping[19] or classical music. These aspects are contrasted with details of the characters\\' domestic lives, which are often far from glamorous.\\nHer novel Pandora is not one of the Rutshire Chronicles, but does feature a few characters from the series, and is very similar in style and content. Wicked! follows the same approach, including characters from previous novels and introducing new characters who are relatives, friends or rivals of existing characters. It is set in the fictional county of Larkshire, which borders her other fictional county, Rutshire.\\nHer novel Jump! was released in 2010.[20] It features characters from the Rutshire Chronicles in the world of National Hunt steeplechase racing, and tells the transformation of a mutilated horse (Mrs Wilkinson) into a successful racehorse.[20] After publication, it was revealed that Cooper had named a goat in the book (Chisolm) in order to hit back at the critic Anne Chisholm.[21]\\nCooper also wrote a series of children\\'s books featuring the heroine Little Mabel.[22]\\nIn 1961, she married Leo Cooper, a publisher of military history books.[1] The couple had known each other since 1945 (when Jilly Sallitt was about eight), although they did not marry until she was 24 and he was 27. The couple was unable to have children naturally, so adopted two children.[23] They have five grandchildren.[24] The Coopers\\' marriage was greatly disrupted in 1990 when publisher Sarah Johnson revealed she and Leo had had an affair for several years, though Jilly and Leo eventually got back together.[25][26] In the 1980s the couple left Putney, southwest London, for The Chantry, an old manor house in Gloucestershire.[1]\\nJilly Cooper was a passenger in one of the derailed carriages in the Ladbroke Grove rail crash of 1999, in which 31 people died,[23] and crawled through a window to escape. She later spoke of feeling that her \"number was up\" and of being absurdly concerned, due to shock, about a manuscript she had been carrying.\\nLeo Cooper was diagnosed with Parkinson\\'s disease in 2002. He died on 29 November 2013 at the age of 79.[1] In 2010, Cooper suffered a minor stroke.[27]\\nCooper has stated that she is a football fan, and supported Leeds United when she lived in Yorkshire.[28] She is also a supporter of the Conservative Party.[29]\\nCooper was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2004 Birthday Honours for services to literature and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to literature and charity.\\nOn 13 November 2009 she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters by the University of Gloucestershire at a ceremony in Gloucester Cathedral.[30]\\nIn 1971, Cooper created the comedy series It\\'s Awfully Bad for Your Eyes, Darling, which featured Joanna Lumley, and ran for one series.[31]\\nTelevision adaptations of Cooper\\'s novels are relatively few but have been accepted by national network ITV.\\nApart from Octavia, other productions include the TV mini-series The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous, starring Hugh Bonneville, produced by Sarah Lawson, and Riders.[32]\\n\\'Little Mabel\\' series:\\nThe Rutshire Chronicles:\\n',\n",

       " 'Lecia Cornwall (born c. 1960 ) is a Canadian author of romantic fiction. Her works have primarily featured the Regency era.\\nLecia Cornwall was born in Toronto, Ontario.[2] She became interested in history after watching the miniseries The Six Wives of Henry VIII at the age of ten, which prompted her to begin reading about the Plantagenets and the Tudors, as well as fairy tales. Years later, after staying home to raise her children, Cornwall decided to begin writing fiction, with a focus on medieval historical romance.[1] To learn how to write a novel, she read as many medieval romances as possible at her local library, including works by Jo Beverley, Philippa Gregory, Jude Deveraux, and Julie Garwood. Having exhausted the library\\'s offerings on the subject, Cornwall discovered Bernard Cornwell\\'s \"dashing, brave, tormented, inspiring hero\" Richard Sharpe, who interested her in reading other Regency-era fiction by such authors as Mary Balogh, Julia Quinn, and Eloisa James.[1] She also read non-fiction works on the era. Cornwall considers the Regency period to be \\n\"One of history\\'s most fascinating eras. Not only do you have the English aristocracy at its peak, complete with titles, grand homes, art and the most baffling code of social behavior ever, you have the sweeping backdrop of great world events — soldiers marching to war, the rise and fall of nations, the changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution, and new ideas in practically every field, from fashion to fiction.\"[1]Cornwall\\'s writing career began in 2009, when she learned that one of her manuscripts had attracted a literary agent wishing to represent her. This manuscript became Cornwall\\'s debut novel, Secrets of a Proper Countess, which was published by Avon Books in 2011. Set in the Regency period, it follows the widowed Countess Isobel Maitland, who is kept as a virtual prisoner by her husband\\'s family until she meets Lord Blackwood, a known scoundrel who is secretly a government spy.[3] A lover of fairy tales, Cornwall approached the story as a hybrid of Cinderella and The Scarlet Pimpernel.[4] Publishers Weekly stated that the novel had \"just the right blend of mystery, manners, and passion,\" with \"truly nefarious villains, plenty of action, and a dash of glamour\" that made it \"a seductive read.\"[5]\\nAvon Books published her novella, All the Pleasures of the Season, in 2011.[6] One of Cornwall\\'s first Regency story drafts was later published in 2012 as How to Deceive a Duke.[3] Publishers Weekly opined that the chemistry of the novel\\'s two protagonists \"will draw the reader into a fast-paced novel that travels from the English countryside and London to the battle of Waterloo.\"[7] In 2013, Avon published her sixth work, Once Upon a Highland Summer.[8]\\n',\n",

Her husband challenged her to prove herself, and the two spent the weekend plotting out a storyline for a gothic romance. She wrote the novel in the evenings.[citation needed]\\nWhen Coulter finished writing her novel she sent it to an editor at Signet. Three days later Signet offered her a three-book contract.

He was soon transferred to Dayton, Ohio[1] and they have since divorced. They have one daughter.[4]\\nCrusie\\'s first career was a teacher, beginning with pre-school, then elementary and junior high art, high school English, and undergraduate college English courses, including 15 years in the Beavercreek, Ohio public school system.  Her teaching subjects included art, literature, mythology, the Bible in literature, college composition, creative writing, and British and American literature, as well as time spent directing the sets and costumes crews for the high school\\'s drama department.[1] She has also taught at Antioch University, Wright State University, Ohio State, and McDaniel College, where she helped design the curriculum for the graduate level Romance Writing Program.[citation needed]\\nCrusie\\'s MFA dissertation focused on the impact of gender on narrative strategies. To research the differences in the way men and women tell stories, Crusie read one hundred romance novels written by women, planning on following that by reading one hundred adventure novels written by men. The romance novels were so compelling that Crusie changed her dissertation to focus on romantic fiction and decided to try her hand at writing a romance novel.[5] She quit her job in the summer of 1991 to devote herself full-time to writing.[1] Crusie completed her first manuscript, called Keeping Kate, in 1991, but was unable to sell it.  She entered a Silhouette-sponsored novella contest in the winter of 1991 and won one of twelve places with a novel called Sizzle.[citation needed] Shortly after that, Harlequin bought Keeping Kate and changed the name to Manhunting, which was Crusie\\'s first published novel, appearing in February 1993.[citation needed]\\nFor the first three years of Crusie\\'s career, her books were published as category romances under the Silhouette, Harlequin, and Bantam Loveswept lines.[1][5] In 1995, Crusie signed with St. Martin\\'s Press, and began writing single title novels, beginning with Tell Me Lies. The switch to longer, non-category novels was easy for Crusie, who says that \"I was never conscious of writing category or single title or paperback or hardcover. You just have to tell the truest story you know.\"[5]  Her long partnership with her editor, Jennifer Enderlin, has made it possible for her to explore many different aspects of storytelling, and Crusie explained the depth of her relationship with her editor in an explanation of why she wasn\\'t self-publishing]: \"SMP still excels at the one thing I\\'d have to work full time to do half as well as they do: Tell people my book is out there. But okay, let\\'s say I could market my own book riding on the coattails of everything my publisher has already established for me. SMP still holds one trump card: Jennifer Enderlin. I don\\'t want to write a book without Jen. She makes me a better writer.\"[6]\\nHer books are known for their humor, although Crusie says she has never \"deliberately written to be funny. ... I think my characters just have a particular kind of sense of humor. They use it the way a lot of people do, to cope with the absurdities of life.\"[3] Crusie usually envisions her characters before the plots,[5] and she crafts them as real people, complete with flaws.[3] Her heroines are usually off-beat and the heroes are clever and charming. Many of her characters collect things because she believes that a person\\'s possessions tell a lot about that person.[5]  She has won the Romance Writers of America Rita award twice, once for category fiction with Getting Rid of Bradley and once for single title romance for Bet Me.[citation needed]\\nIn September 2004, Crusie met adventure novelist Bob Mayer at the Maui Writers Conference. By the end of the conference, they had become friends and begun the outline for a novel. Within a year, they had finished the manuscript, collaborating primarily via email. In the novel, Don\\'t Look Down, Crusie wrote the scenes and dialogue for the female protagonist, while Mayer wrote the scenes and dialogue for the male protagonist. Crusie\\'s longtime editor, Jennifer Enderlin, also edited this book, and had to ask Crusie who had written each section as she couldn\\'t tell them apart. The novel was given an initial printing of 300,000\\xa0copies, Crusie\\'s highest initial printing to date.[7]  In August 2007, their second collaborative novel, Agnes and the Hitman, was released and made the New York Times best seller list. They again partnered up for March 2010\\'s release of Wild Ride.  Crusie has also collaborated with Eileen Dreyer and Anne Stuart on The Unfortunate Miss Fortunes (2007), and on Dogs and Goddesses (2009) with Anne Stuart and Lani Diane Rich.[8]\\nIn 2010 Crusie published her first solo in six years, Maybe This Time.[9] This is Crusie\\'s version of Henry James\\' The Turn of the Screw.  In Crusie\\'s version the governess is not young and inexperienced, the children are not perfectly behaved, they are not isolated because house guests keep turning up and moving in, and the faraway guardian turns up and becomes part of the story.[citation needed]\\nShe also continues her interest in the academic side of fiction. Early in her academic career, she published a book of literary criticism on Anne Rice under the name Jennifer Smith; and she\\'s been active in pop culture criticism, both on her blog Argh Ink and for Benbella Press, editing three essay collections and contributing to others.[citation needed]\\n\\n',\n",

The two continued to work together, often spending 17 hours a day, seven days a week at work[4] and married in 1964.[citation needed]\\nIn 1974, after asserting that she could write a better romance novel than those she had read, Dailey\\'s husband challenged her to prove it. Dailey spent eight months writing her first manuscript, No Quarter Asked, and then sent a query letter to Harlequin asking if they would like to read it. She was informed that because Harlequin only reprinted Mills & Boon novels at that point, so she would need to reach out to them in London.[5] Mills & Boon acquired the book and released it in 1974. This made Dailey the first American woman to be published by Mills & Boon.[6] In 1976, having already published multiple titles for Mills & Boon, No Quarter Asked was released by Harlequin as part of its Presents line. While many have claimed that Dailey was the first American author published by Harlequin, the Canadian publisher had in fact published many American authors prior to 1958, when it began exclusively reprinting Mills & Book titles.[6] For the remainder of the 1970s, Harlequin reportedly used Dailey\\'s presence on their roster as an excuse for rejecting other American authors, such as Nora Roberts, claiming they \"already had their American writer.\"[7]\\nDailey \"provide[d]\\xa0... [the] first look at heroines, heroes and courtships that take place in America, with American sensibilities, assumptions, history, and most of all, settings.\"[8] She introduced the Western romance, romance novels set in the American West. The Western romance focused on the female, who was often marginalized in traditional Western novels. Because her novels were set in contemporary times, there is little frontier, but the novels recreate that feeling by introducing \"physical confrontation of the elements\" and focusing on the \"primary nature of the pursuit\" by a man and woman \"unconstrained by any society\\'s expectations of them.\"[9] Many of the themes in her novels were groundbreaking for the genre. Her heroines, unlike most, lost their virginity. Others fell in love with poor or unattractive heroes.[4]\\nShe wrote a total of 57 novels for Harlequin.[citation needed] Among these novels were 50 in the \"Janet Dailey Americana Series,\" in which every state in the United States was represented. The Guinness Book of World Records recognized her for this achievement of setting a novel in every state. By 1998, her Harlequin novels had sold a combined 80 million copies.[10] Dailey was also one of the early writers for the Silhouette lines, for which she wrote 12 titles.\\nDuring her most prolific years, Dailey set herself the goal of writing 15 pages per day. Her day began at 4 a.m. On good days, she would meet her quota in 8 to 10 hours; other days would require 12 to 14 hours of work.[4] When she met her goal, Dailey would often stop writing, even if she were in the middle of a sentence. The unfinished thoughts provided her an incentive to begin writing again the next day.[10] Some of her early novels for Harlequin took only eight days to write.[4]\\nIn 1979, Dailey became the first romance author to transition from writing category romances to writing single-title romance novels.[10] Her first mass market romance novel, Touch the Wind, reached the New York Times Best Seller List. Her subsequent books have also been New York Times Best Sellers. There are currently more than 325\\xa0million copies of her books in print, with translations in 19 languages for 98 countries.\\nIn 1982, Dailey adapted her novel Foxfire Light into a film, starring Leslie Nielsen, Tippi Hedren, Faye Grant and Barry Van Dyke.[11]\\nDailey began offering The Janet Dailey Award in 1993. This $5,000 annual award was given to an author whose romance novel best addressed a social issue.[10]\\nDailey was sued in 1997 by fellow novelist Nora Roberts, who accused Dailey of copying her work over a period of more than seven years. The practice came to light after a reader read Roberts\\' Sweet Revenge and Dailey\\'s Notorious back-to-back; she noticed several similarities and posted the comparable passages on the internet. Calling the plagiarism \"mind rape\", Roberts sued Dailey.[12] Dailey acknowledged the theft and blamed it on a psychological disorder. She admitted that both Aspen Gold and Notorious lifted heavily from Roberts\\' work; both novels were subsequently pulled from print.[13][14] In April 1998 Dailey settled the case.  Although terms were not released, Roberts had previously indicated that any settlement funds should be donated to the Literacy Volunteers of America.[12][15]\\nIn 2001, Dailey returned to publishing with a four-book deal with Kensington Books. The contract called for two books in the Calder series Dailey has written about a ranching family in Montana, and two books with holiday themes.[16] Kensington expanded their relationship with Dailey in 2002, when she contracted for three more hardcover novels about the Calder family and an additional mass market original novel. At the same time, they purchased the reprint rights to 50 of her previously published romances.[17]\\nIn 1978, Dailey and her husband Bill moved from Council Bluffs, Iowa to Branson, Missouri, where Bill promoted and produced shows at the Americana Theater.[18] He died on August 5, 2005.[19]\\nDailey considered Branson \"an ideal place to live. The weather is generally good, the country is beautiful, and the people are so friendly—and unobtrusive.\"[11]\\nShe died at her home in Branson on December 14, 2013, from complications of heart surgery.[1]\\n',\n",

       " 'Christina Dodd (born July 14,\\xa0?) is the best-selling American author of suspense and regency historical romance. She is a recipient of the RITA Award.\\nDodd is the youngest of three daughters (her sisters are 8 and 10 years older than she is) whose father died before she was born.  Although her mother had been a housewife with few job skills, after Dodd\\'s birth she found a job and worked diligently to support her children.  Despite the hard work, she still found time every day to read to her children, instilling in Dodd a love of books.[1]\\nDodd attended college in Boise, Idaho, where she met her husband, Scott.  After graduation, she worked as a draftsman in an engineering firm, designing a sawmill.  During her lunch hour, Dodd would begin reading a romance novel.  While working during the afternoon, she would often plot an ending for the story, and almost always eventually discovered that she liked her endings better than the ones the author intended.[2]\\nAfter her daughter was born in 1980, Dodd decided to stay at home and try to write a book.  Over the next ten years, she wrote three romance novels.[3]  For five of these years, she also worked part-time at an independent bookstore.  By talking to customers and watching what they purchased, Dodd was able to learn more about what people like to read.[4]  Her first two manuscripts were consistently rejected.[3]  The third, Candle in the Window, won the Romance Writers of America Golden Heart Award for unpublished authors,[5] resulting in its publication in 1991 by HarperCollins.  The book won many awards and has not gone out of print.[3]\\nHer first editor was conservative, and often cut or severely trimmed the love scenes that Dodd had written.  When Dodd moved from HarperCollins to Avon, her new editor chose not to interfere in the love scenes.  Her first novel for Avon, A Well Pleasured Lady, was the first of her novels to include love scenes written in Dodd\\'s \"normal, unedited frankness.\"[2] A Well Pleasured Lady also marked Dodd\\'s transition to writing historical romances set in the Regency period.  Regencies allowed her to continue writing historicals while including fewer details on \"what the characters are wearing, what the idioms mean, and who the scions of society were.\"[2]\\nThe heroines of Dodd\\'s historical romance novels are based on her mother, an \"impoverished yet determined woman who, in spite of adversity, fights to take control of her life and always wins.\"[1]\\nHer novels have since been translated into twelve languages[citation needed] and have appeared on The New York Times, USA Today, and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists.  Her 2003 novel, My Favorite Bride, spent 15 weeks in the top 15 of the New York Times Best Seller List.  The Romance Writers of America have awarded her their RITA Award, the highest honor given to romance novelists.[3]  Dodd has even appeared as a clue in the Los Angeles Times crossword puzzle (on November 18, 2005).\\nIn 2003 Dodd released her first contemporary romance.[3]\\nDodd and her family have lived in California, Idaho, and Texas, but they currently reside in Washington. She and her husband constructed a 5300-pound standing stone circle on their Washington property, where they celebrate the annual summer solstice.[6]\\nDodd normally begins her writing process with a 10-20 page outline of the story.  Every morning, she revises the pages that she wrote the day before.  After refamiliarizing herself with the storyline, she then continues writing.  She will also usually lightly outline the next few chapters that she is intending to write.  When she reaches the midpoint of the manuscript, she often does a larger-scale revision.  By the time she reaches the conclusion of the story, it is ready to be sent to the editors.[5]\\nDodd also relies occasionally on plot weekends.  She and several friends who are romance novelists, including Connie Brockway and Susan Mallery, meet at a hotel for three days.  Each author takes a turn, describing the type of book she wants to write and the ideas that she already has.  The group then brainstorms various plot scenarios.[5]\\n(Technically, That Scandalous Evening is not part of the Governess Brides series and is listed under the \"My Stand Alone\" heading, but characters in the book do show up and the events in the novel take place before those in the later Governess Brides books.)\\nThis series is loosely tied to the earlier \"Lost Texas Heart\" series\\n',\n",

       " '\\nDame Daphne du Maurier, Lady Browning,[1] DBE (/duː ˈmɒrieɪ/; 13 May 1907 – 19 April 1989) was an English novelist, biographer and playwright. Her parents were actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and his wife, actress Muriel Beaumont. Her grandfather was George du Maurier, a writer and cartoonist.\\nAlthough du Maurier is classed as a romantic novelist, her stories have been described as \"moody and resonant\" with overtones of the paranormal. Her bestselling works were not at first taken seriously by critics, but they have since earned an enduring reputation for narrative craft. Many have been successfully adapted into films, including the novels Rebecca, Frenchman\\'s Creek, My Cousin Rachel and Jamaica Inn, and the short stories \"The Birds\" and \"Don\\'t Look Now\". Du Maurier spent much of her life in Cornwall, where most of her works are set. As her fame increased, she became more reclusive.[2]\\nDaphne du Maurier was born at 24 Cumberland Terrace, Regent\\'s Park, London, the middle of three daughters of prominent actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and actress Muriel Beaumont.[3] Her paternal grandfather was author and Punch cartoonist George du Maurier, who created the character of Svengali in the 1894 novel Trilby. Her paternal uncle Guy du Maurier was a playwright. Her mother was a paternal niece of journalist, author, and lecturer Comyns Beaumont.[4] Her elder sister, Angela du Maurier, became an actress and later also a writer, and her younger sister Jeanne du Maurier was a painter.[5] She was a cousin of the Llewelyn Davies boys, who were J. M. Barrie\\'s inspiration for the characters in the play Peter Pan; or, The Boy Who Wouldn\\'t Grow Up.[5] She was also a cousin of director Gabrielle Beaumont.[6]\\nAs a child, du Maurier met many prominent theatre actors, because of the celebrity of her father. On meeting Tallulah Bankhead, du Maurier was quoted as saying that Bankhead was the most beautiful creature she had ever seen.[7]\\nDu Maurier spent her childhood at Cannon Hall, Hampstead, the family\\'s London residence, and summers at their home in Fowey, Cornwall, where they also lived during the war years.\\nDu Maurier married Major (later Lieutenant-General) Frederick \"Boy\" Browning in 1932. They had three children:\\nBiographers have noted that du Maurier\\'s marriage was at times somewhat chilly and that she could be aloof and distant to her children, especially the girls, when immersed in her writing.[8][9] Her husband died in 1965 and soon after Daphne moved to Kilmarth, near Par, Cornwall, which became the setting for The House on the Strand.\\nDu Maurier has often been painted as a frostily private recluse who rarely mixed in society or gave interviews.[9] An exception to this came after the release of the film A Bridge Too Far, in which her late husband was portrayed in a less-than-flattering light. Incensed, she wrote to the national newspapers, decrying what she considered unforgivable treatment.[10] Once out of the public spotlight, however, many remembered her as a warm and immensely funny person who was a welcoming hostess to guests at Menabilly,[11] the house that she had leased for many years, from the Rashleigh family in Cornwall.\\nShe appeared as a castaway in the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs broadcast on 3 September 1977. Her chosen book was The Collected Works of Jane Austen, and her luxury was whiskey and ginger ale.[12]\\nDu Maurier was an early member of Mebyon Kernow, a Cornish nationalist party.[13]\\nShe was known as Daphne du Maurier from 1907 to 1932, when she married Frederick Browning. Still writing as Daphne du Maurier during her marriage, she was also known as Lady Browning after her husband was knighted in 1946.[14] When she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1969,[1] she was titled Dame Daphne du Maurier, Lady Browning, DBE, but she never used the title.\\nAccording to her biographer Margaret Forster, she told no one about the honour, so that even her children learned of it only from the newspapers. \"She thought of pleading illness for the investiture, until her children insisted it would be a great day for the older grandchildren. So she went through with it, though she slipped out quietly afterwards to avoid the attention of the press.\"[15]\\nAfter du Maurier\\'s death in 1989, some writers speculated about her alleged relationships with a number of women,[8] including the actress Gertrude Lawrence and Ellen Doubleday, the wife of her U.S. publisher Nelson Doubleday.[9][a] Du Maurier stated in her memoirs that her father had wanted a son;[8] being a tomboy, she wished to have been born a boy.\\nThe Daphne du Maurier Companion, edited by Helen Taylor, includes Taylor\\'s claims that du Maurier confessed to her in 1965 that she had had an incestuous relationship with her father and that he had been a violent alcoholic.[18]\\nIn correspondence that her family released to biographer Margaret Forster, du Maurier explained to a trusted few people her own unique slant on her sexuality: her personality comprised two distinct people – the loving wife and mother (the side she showed to the world); and the lover (a \"decidedly male energy\") hidden from virtually everyone and the power behind her artistic creativity. According to Forster\\'s biography, du Maurier believed the \"male energy\" propelled her writing.[19] Forster wrote that du Maurier\\'s \"denial\" of her bisexuality unveiled a \"homophobic\" fear of her true nature.[9]\\nThe children of both du Maurier and Lawrence have objected strongly to the stories about their mothers\\' alleged intimate relationship. Two years after Lawrence died, a biography of her authored by her widower, Richard Aldrich, went into detail about a friendship between her and du Maurier that had begun in 1948 when Lawrence had accepted the lead role in du Maurier\\'s new play September Tide.[20] Aldrich said that Lawrence had toured Britain in the play in 1948 and continued with it in London\\'s West End theatre district through 1949, and that later du Maurier visited them at their home in the United States.[20] Aldrich made no mention of a possible same-sex relationship.[20]\\nDu Maurier died from heart failure in her sleep on 19 April 1989, aged 81, at her home in Par, Cornwall,[3] which had been the setting for many of her books. Her body was cremated in private and without a memorial service (at her request)[21] and her ashes scattered off the cliffs around Kilmarth and Menabilly, Cornwall.[3][22]\\nHer family connections helped her establish her literary career, and she published some of her early work in her great uncle Comyns Beaumont\\'s Bystander magazine. Her first novel, The Loving Spirit, was published in 1931.\\nThe novel Rebecca (1938) was du Maurier\\'s most successful work. It was an immediate hit, selling nearly 3 million copies between 1938 and 1965. The novel has never gone out of print. In the United States, du Maurier won the National Book Award for favourite novel of 1938, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association.[23] In the UK, it was listed at number 14 of the \"nation\\'s best-loved novel\"s on the BBC\\'s 2003 survey The Big Read.[24]\\nOther significant works include Jamaica Inn, Frenchman\\'s Creek, Hungry Hill, My Cousin Rachel, The Scapegoat, The House on the Strand, and The King\\'s General. The last is set in Cornwall during the English Civil War, and is written from the Royalist perspective. \\nDu Maurier was often categorised as a \"romantic novelist\", a term that she deplored,[25] given that her novels rarely have a happy ending, and often have sinister overtones and shadows of the paranormal. In this light, she has more in common with the \"sensation novels\" of Wilkie Collins and others, which she admired.[11] The critic Kate Kellaway wrote: \"Du Maurier was mistress of calculated irresolution. She did not want to put her readers\\' minds at rest. She wanted her riddles to persist. She wanted the novels to continue to haunt us beyond their endings.\"[26]\\nDu Maurier\\'s novel Mary Anne (1954) is a fictionalised account of her great-great-grandmother, Mary Anne Clarke née Thompson (1776–1852), who, from 1803 to 1808, was mistress of Frederick Augustus, Duke of York and Albany (1763–1827). He was the \"Grand Old Duke of York\" of the nursery rhyme, a son of King George III, and brother of King George IV and King William IV. The central character of her last novel, Rule Britannia, is an aging actress, thought to be based on Gladys Cooper (to whom it is dedicated).[27]\\nDu Maurier\\'s short stories are darker: \"The Birds\", \"Don\\'t Look Now\", \"The Apple Tree\", and \"The Blue Lenses\" are finely crafted tales of terror that shocked and surprised her audience in equal measure.[citation needed] As her biographer Margaret Forster wrote, \"She satisfied all the questionable criteria of popular fiction, and yet satisfied too the exacting requirements of \\'real literature\\'.\"[28]\\nThe discovery, in 2011, of a collection of du Maurier\\'s forgotten short stories, written when the author was 21, provides some insight into her mature style. One of them, \"The Doll\", concerns a young woman\\'s obsession with a mechanical male sex doll; it has been deemed by du Maurier\\'s son Kit Browning to be \"quite ahead of its time\".[29]\\nShe also wrote non-fiction, including several biographies such as Gerald, her father\\'s biography. The Glass-Blowers traces her French Huguenot ancestry and vividly depicts the French Revolution. The du Mauriers traces the family\\'s move from France to England in the 19th century.[30]\\nThe House on the Strand (1969) combines elements of \"mental time-travel\", a tragic love affair in 14th-century Cornwall, and the dangers of using mind-altering drugs. Her final book, Rule Britannia (1972), was not well-received, her biographer, Margaret Forster, considering it to be the author\\'s poorest novel.[31]\\nRebecca has been adapted for both stage and screen several times, most notably by Alfred Hitchcock in his 1940 film Rebecca. Several of du Maurier\\'s other novels have also been adapted for the screen, including Jamaica Inn, Frenchman\\'s Creek, Hungry Hill, and My Cousin Rachel in both 1952 and 2017. The Hitchcock film The Birds (1963) is based on a treatment of the short story of that name, as is the film Don\\'t Look Now (1973). Of the films, du Maurier often complained that the only ones she liked were Hitchcock\\'s Rebecca and Nicolas Roeg\\'s Don\\'t Look Now.[citation needed]\\nHitchcock\\'s treatment of Jamaica Inn was disavowed by both director and author, due to a complete re-write of the ending to accommodate the ego of its star, Charles Laughton. Du Maurier also felt that Olivia de Havilland was wrongly cast as the anti-heroine of My Cousin Rachel (1952).[32] Frenchman\\'s Creek fared better in a lavish Technicolor version released in 1944. Du Maurier later regretted her choice of Alec Guinness as the lead in the film of The Scapegoat, which she partly financed.[11]\\nDu Maurier wrote three plays. Her first was an adaptation of her novel Rebecca, which opened at the Queen\\'s Theatre in London on 5 March 1940 in a production by George Devine, starring Celia Johnson and Owen Nares as the De Winters and Margaret Rutherford as Mrs. Danvers. After 181 performances, the production transferred to the Strand Theatre, with Jill Furse taking over as the second Mrs. De Winter and Mary Merrall as Mrs. Danvers, with a further run of 176 performances.\\nIn 1943 she wrote the autobiographically inspired drama The Years Between about the unexpected return of a senior officer, thought killed in action, who finds that his wife has taken his seat as Member of Parliament (MP) and has started a romantic relationship with a local farmer. It was first staged at the Manchester Opera House in 1944 and then transferred to London, opening at Wyndham\\'s Theatre on 10 January 1945, starring Nora Swinburne and Clive Brook. The production, directed by Irene Hentschel, became a long-running hit, completing 617 performances. It was revived by Caroline Smith at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond upon Thames on 5 September 2007, starring Karen Ascoe and Mark Tandy.[33]\\nHer third play, September Tide, portrays a middle-aged woman whose bohemian artist son-in-law falls in love with her. Again directed by Irene Hentschel, it opened at the Aldwych Theatre on 15 December 1948 with Gertrude Lawrence as Stella. It closed in August 1949 after 267 performances.\\nShortly after Rebecca was published in Brazil, critic Álvaro Lins and other readers pointed out many resemblances to the 1934 book, A Sucessora (The Successor), by Brazilian writer Carolina Nabuco. According to Nabuco and her editor, not only the main plot, but also situations and entire dialogues had been copied.[34] Du Maurier denied having copied Nabuco\\'s book, as did her publisher, pointing out that the plot elements said to have been plagiarised were quite common.[35]\\n\\nThe controversy was examined in a 2002 article by Larry Rohter in The New York Times.[36] According to Nabuco\\'s memoirs, when the Hitchcock film Rebecca was first shown in Brazil, United Artists wanted Nabuco to sign a document stating that the similarities were merely a coincidence but she refused.[37] Rohter quotes Nabuco\\'s memoirs as saying, When the film version of \\'Rebecca\\' came to Brazil, the producers\\' lawyer sought out my lawyer to ask him that I sign a document admitting the possibility of there having been a mere coincidence. I would be compensated with a quantity described as \\'of considerable value.\\' I did not consent, naturally.[36] Rohter remarked: \"Nabuco had translated her novel into French and sent it to a publisher in Paris, who she learned was also Ms. du Maurier\\'s [publisher] only after Rebecca became a worldwide success. The novels have identical plots and even some identical episodes.\"[36]\\nAuthor Frank Baker believed that du Maurier had plagiarised his novel The Birds (1936) in her short story \"The Birds\" (1952). Du Maurier had been working as a reader for Baker\\'s publisher Peter Llewelyn Davies at the time he submitted the book.[citation needed] When Hitchcock\\'s The Birds was released in 1963, based on du Maurier\\'s story, Baker considered, but was advised against, pursuing costly litigation against Universal Studios.[38]\\n',\n",

       " 'Mignon Good Eberhart (July 6, 1899, Lincoln, Nebraska – October 8, 1996, Greenwich, Connecticut) was an American author of mystery novels. She had one of the longest careers (from the 1920s to the 1980s) among major American mystery writers.\\nMignonette Good was born July 6, 1899, in Lincoln, Nebraska.[1] As a teenager, Good often wrote short stories and novels to occupy herself.[2] From 1917 to 1920, she attended Nebraska Wesleyan University but did not complete the coursework for a degree.[3] In 1923, she married Alanson Clyde Eberhart,[2] and began writing short stories to combat boredom. Within several years, she had begun writing novels.[3] In 1929, she published her first novel, The Patient in Room 18, which introduced her series character Nurse Sarah Keate and her boyfriend Detective Lance O\\'Leary.[2] A second novel, While the Patient Slept, also featuring Keate, received the $5000 Scotland Yard Prize in 1931. Four years later, Eberhart\\'s alma mater presented her with an honorary doctorate.[3]\\nBy the end of the 1930s, Eberhart had become the leading female crime novelist in the United States and was one of the highest-paid female crime novelists in the world, next to Agatha Christie. She was one of the first of many writers called, by their publishers, \"America\\'s Agatha Christie,\" few of which had as little in common with \\'Dame Agatha in matters of plotting, characterization, or even type of story.\\'[4] She wrote a total of 59 novels, the last published in 1988, shortly before her 89th birthday.[3] Eight of her novels were adapted as movies, beginning in 1935 with While the Patient Slept. The last adaptation, based on the book Hasty Wedding, was the movie Three\\'s a Crowd, released in 1945.[5] She also collaborated with Robert Wallsten to adapt her novel Fair Warning into the play, Eight O\\'Clock Tuesday, which played first at the Cleveland Playhouse in Ohio in 1939–40, and then on Broadway in 1941, starring Celeste Holm.[6][7][8]\\nSarah Keate, though popular as the protagonist of Eberhart\\'s first five novels, proved to be the author\\'s only series sleuth, making only a couple of appearances after the early 1930s. Instead, Eberhart wrote mostly \"standalone\" mysteries, something fairly unusual for a crime writer with such a large output.\\nEberhart was one of the more prolific of the practitioners of the classic romantic suspense novel that had begun with some of the earliest work of Anna Katharine Green and was brought to its height by Mary Roberts Rinehart in the early 20th century.[4] There had been many female sleuths featured in short stories previously, and Rinehart had introduced her own nurse-detective, Hilda Adams, aka \"Miss Pinkerton,\" in the second decade of the 20th century. But in 1929, when Eberhart introduced Sarah Keate, it was still relatively rare to have a female lead in novel-length \"straight detective stories\". The year after Eberhart\\'s first novel was published, Agatha Christie wrote the first novel featuring her female detective, Jane Marple, who had previously appeared in short stories collected as \"The Tuesday Club Murders\".[9]\\nEberhart\\'s works often featured female protagonists, and tended to include exotic locations, wealthy characters, and suspense and romance.[3] Her characterization has been praised, her characters described as always having \"genuine and believable motives for everything they do.\" Her \"writing is spare but almost lyrical.\"[4]\\nIn 1971, she was awarded the Mystery Writers of America\\'s Grand Master Award. Eberhart also served as president of the Mystery Writers of America.[2] In 1994, she received the Agatha Award: Malice Domestic Award for Lifetime Achievement.\\nThe normally prolific Eberhart wrote relatively few books in the 1940s, possibly due to upheaval in her personal life.[5] After 20 years of marriage, she divorced Alanson Eberhart, and in 1946 married John Hazen Perry.[3] But within two years, she had divorced Perry and remarried Eberhart.[4] The Eberharts remained married until his death in 1974.\\nEberhart died in 1996. She is buried in Long Island National Cemetery, a Veterans Administration burial site, beside husband Alanson, who had served as a Navy lieutenant commander in World War II.

       " '\\nJanet Evanovich (née Schneider; April 22, 1943) is an American writer. She began her career writing short contemporary romance novels under the pen name Steffie Hall, but gained fame authoring a series of contemporary mysteries featuring Stephanie Plum, a former lingerie buyer from Trenton, New Jersey, who becomes a bounty hunter to make ends meet after losing her job. The novels in this series have been on The New York Times, USA Today, Wall Street Journal and Amazon bestseller lists. Evanovich has had her last seventeen Plums debut at #1 on the NY Times Best Sellers list and eleven of them have hit #1 on USA Today Best-Selling Books list. She has over two hundred million books in print worldwide, and her books have been translated into over 40 languages.\\nEvanovich is a second-generation American born in South River, New Jersey, to a machinist and a housewife.[1] After attending South River High School,[2] she became the first in her family to attend college when she enrolled at Douglass College, part of Rutgers University, to study art.[3][4]\\nWhen Evanovich had children, she chose to become a housewife like her mother. In her thirties, she began writing novels.[1] To learn the art of writing dialog, Evanovich took lessons in improv acting.[4] For ten years, she attempted to write the Great American Novel, finishing three manuscripts that she was unable to sell. After someone suggested she try writing romance novels, Evanovich read several romances and discovered that she enjoyed the genre. She wrote two romances and submitted them for publishing.[5] Still unable to find a publisher, Evanovich stopped writing and signed with a temporary employment agency. Several months after beginning work for them, she received an offer to buy her second romance manuscript for $2,000, which she considered an \"astounding sum.\"[4]\\nThat novel, Hero at Large, was published in 1987 in the Second Chance Love category line under the pseudonym Steffie Hall.[1] The following year she began writing for Bantam Loveswept under her own name.[5] For the next five years she continued to write category romances for Loveswept.[4] Her work within the romance novel genre helped her learn to create likable characters and attractive leading men.[6] In this time, Evanovich also became known for the humor that filled her novels. She believes that \"it\\'s very important to take a comic approach. If we can laugh at something, we can face it.\"[7]\\nAfter finishing her twelfth romance, however, Evanovich realized that she was more interested in writing the action sequences in her novels than the sex scenes. Her editors were not interested in her change of heart, so Evanovich took the next eighteen months to formulate a plan for what she actually wanted to write.[1]\\nShe quickly decided that she wanted to write romantic adventure novels.[8] She wanted to include humor, romance and adventure in her work and this fit into her style of mystery novel.[9] Unlike the style of romance novels, her books would be told in first person narrative.[4]  Her new type of writing should contain heroes and heroines, as well as \"a sense of family and community.\"[1] In that vein, she intended her new style of writing to be based on the TV sitcom model. Like Seinfeld, her new books would have a central character that the rest of the cast of characters revolve around.[8]\\nInspired by the Robert De Niro movie Midnight Run, Evanovich decided that her heroine would be a bounty hunter.[1] This occupation provided more freedom for Evanovich as a writer, as bounty hunters do not have a set work schedule and are not forced to wear a uniform. The profession is also \"romanticised to some extent.\"[7] To become acquainted with the demands of the career, Evanovich spent a great deal of time shadowing bond enforcement agents. She also researched more about the city of Trenton, where she wanted her books to be set.[1]\\nIn 1994, her initial romantic adventure, One for the Money, was published to good reviews.[1] This was the first of a light-hearted series of mysteries starring barely competent bounty hunter Stephanie Plum. One for the Money was named a New York Times notable book, a Publishers Weekly Best Book of 1994 and a USA Today Best Bet.[10]\\nEvanovich has continued to write romantic adventures starring Stephanie Plum. The sixth book in the series, Hot Six, was the first of her novels to reach number one on the New York Times Best Seller List.[3] Her subsequent Plum novels have each debuted at number one.[11] All About Romance has described her as the \"rare breed of romance author who has left the genre and yet not alienated her many romance fans.\"[5]\\nThe Plum novels have taken many attributes from Evanovich\\'s own life. Evanovich shares many commonalities with her character Stephanie Plum. Both are from New Jersey, both devour Cheetos, both had owned a hamster, and both have shared \"similar embarrassing experiences.\"[4] The character Grandma Mazur is loosely based on Evanovich\\'s \"Grandma Fanny\" and \"Aunt Lena.\" Evanovich claims the spirited elderly lady is \"who I want to be when I grow up.\"[6]\\nShortly before One for the Money was released, Evanovich sold the movie rights to Columbia TriStar for $1 million.[3] Lions Gate Entertainment released One for the Money on January 27, 2012. The film stars Katherine Heigl as Stephanie Plum, Sherri Shepherd from The View as Lula, Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur, Jason O\\'Mara as Joe Morelli, and Daniel Sunjata as Ranger.  It was directed by Julie Anne Robinson.[12]\\nHer latest Stephanie Plum novel, Dirty Thirty  was released October 31, 2023.\\nIn 2016 Evanovich released the first book, Curious Minds, in her new Knight & Moon mystery series.  Co-authored with Phoef Sutton, the book introduces two new characters, Emerson Knight and Riley Moon.  Emerson Knight is a rich, eccentric introvert with little-to-no sense of social etiquette.  He is also brilliant and handsome.  Riley Moon is a recent Harvard Law and Harvard Business graduate.  Her aggressive Texas spitfire attitude helped her land her dream job as a junior analyst at Blane-Grunwald where Emerson is a client.  Together this unlikely duo finds themselves thrust into solving the most difficult of mysteries.\\nDangerous Minds, the second book in the series, was written by Evanovich and released in June 2017. \\nIn 2010 Evanovich published Wicked Appetite, spinning off the character Diesel from the between the numbers Plum books.  The heroine of Wicked Appetite is sweet cupcake baker Lizzie Tucker, who, unlike Stephanie Plum, can cook.  The \"Wicked\" series is set in Salem, Massachusetts.  In the series, Diesel & Lizzie search for the seven stones of power, each representing a different deadly sin.  Lizzie & Diesel are \"Unmentionables\", humans with additional powers. Their rivals for the stones are Diesel\\'s dark cousin, Gerwulf \"Wulf\" Grimoire, introduced in Plum Spooky and his medieval-esque minion Hatchet.  Lizzie\\'s animal companions are one-eyed Cat 7143 and Carl the Monkey, from Fearless Fourteen and Plum Spooky.   Her friends include Glo, a \"Questionable,\" and Clara Dazzle, an \"Unmentionable\" who lost her powers after congress with another \"Unmentionable.\"  In Wicked Appetite, the stone sought is that incarnating the sin of gluttony.\\nIn 2012 Evanovich published Wicked Business, the second in the series.  In Wicked Business, the stone embodies the sin of lust.  A new villain is introduced, deranged candy heiress Deirdre Early, or Anarchy.  Lizzie, through a selfless act and exchange of body fluids with Wulf, converts the lust stone into the \"icky true love stone\", implying that in the right circumstances, the stones of sin can be converted into stones of virtue.\\nIn 2015 Evanovich teamed up with Phoef Sutton for the third novel in the series, Wicked Charms. The Stone of Avarice (Greed) is the focus of this installment.\\nIn June 2013, Evanovich published the novella \"Pros & Cons\" and the novel The Heist, the first two works in a new series co-written with Lee Goldberg. Since then the series has grown to six novels (The Heist, The Chase, The Job, The Scam, The Pursuit, and The Big Kahuna), two novellas (Pros & Cons and The Shell Game) and one online short-story, The Caper.\\nThe protagonist is FBI special agent Kate O’Hare who has devoted her career to taking down one of the FBI’s most wanted con men and master thieves, Nick Fox. That is until the FBI pairs Kate with the most unlikely person, Nick Fox, to take down criminals. Together they travel the globe skirting on the edge of what is legal and illegal. Kate’s father, Jake O’Hare, a retired Special Forces operative, often aids in their quest.  In June 2016, the fifth novel in the series, The Pursuit, was released.\\nEvanovich began a collaborative effort with Charlotte Hughes because she wanted to see some of her other ideas on paper but did not have the time to write them. This resulted in the \"Full\" series.  The \"Full\" series is set in Beaumont, South Carolina and features Jamie Swift and Maximillian Holt, who meet in the second \"Full\" book, Full Tilt.[6]\\nThe Elsie Hawkins novels are stand alone romances with a supporting character Elsie Hawkins, who is a gun totin\\' retiree, with tight grey curls, who \"doesn\\'t take sass from no one.\"  Elsie drives a 1957 powder blue Cadillac that never seems to sustain damage.  In the Stephanie Plum series, Grandma Mazur and Stephanie drive Uncle Sandor\\'s 1953 powder blue Buick,[13] which has similar indestructibility.\\nIn 2004, Evanovich launched another series with Metro Girl. This book debuted at Number 2 on the New York Times Best Seller List.[11] The heroine is Alexandra Barnaby, an auto mechanic.  Her love interest is Sam Hooker, a hedonistic NASCAR driver.

She wrote under her first married name and under the pen-names: Denise Chesterton, Eve Vaill, \\'Anne Llewellyn\\', Hervey Hamilton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray and Julia Kane, producing short stories, plays, and about 170 Gothic romance novels. In 1965, Robins published her autobiography, Stranger Than Fiction. At the time of her death in 1985, Robins\\'s books had been translated into fifteen languages and had sold more than one hundred million copies. In 1984, they were borrowed more than one and a half million times from British libraries.[2]\\nShe was the daughter of the novelist K. C. Groom, and mother of romance novelist Patricia Robins. Some other members of her family are well-known artists.\\nRobins was born Denise Naomi Klein on 1 February 1897 in London, England, the daughter of Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell, who was also a prolific author who wrote under several names, and of her first husband, Herman Klein, who was a professor of music and journalist. Of Russian Jewish ancestry, he had been born in Norwich in 1856. Her mother Kathleen Clarice had been born in Melbourne, Australia, on 11 March 1872 and was the daughter of George Cornwell and his wife Jemima Ridpath, married in 1850.[3] George Cornwell was a railway guard who became a successful gold prospector in Australia, operating several mines, and a notable building contractor. His eldest daughter, Alice Cornwell, born 1852, was spectacularly rich by the 1890s, returning to England and buying the Sunday Times newspaper.[4][5]\\nHer parents had married in 1890. He had a daughter Sibyl Klein, from a previous marriage, and they had two sons: Adrian Bernard Klein (1892–1969) and Daryl Klein (1894), before the birth of Denise Naomi Klein (1897–1985). The childhood of Denise, Adrian and Daryl Klein was far from settled. Kathleen Klein began an affair with a Worcestershire Regiment officer called Herbert Berkeley Dealtry, who was much younger than her husband, and little than herself, and when Hermann Klein became aware of it he filed a petition for divorce, which was granted in December 1901. Kathleen then married Dealtry.[4]\\nIn 1905, the Dealtrys had some serious troubles in connection with the promotion of dog shows, which they had been drawn into by Kathleen\\'s sister Alice Stennard Robinson, a leading member of the Ladies\\' Kennel Association (founded 1904) and the National Cat Club. Somehow, the money from the first dog show went missing, and the Dealtrys held a second show to pay the prize money owed on the first. After the second show, prize winners sued Dealtry, which led to his being declared bankrupt.[4] The family then lived in America for a few years but, by 1908, Kathleen (or \\'Kit\\') Dealtry was back in London, writing Christian novels.[6] In 1918 she married for a third time and wrote at least three books[7] as Mrs Sydney Groom.[4]\\nHer eldest brother Adrian Bernard Klein also became a writer, he was an artist and wrote books on photography and cinematography. After serving as an officer in the British Army, he became a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and changed his name to Adrian Cornwell-Clyne.[4]\\nDenise Naomi Klein married firstly Arthur Robins in 1918, a corn broker on the Baltic Exchange,[8] they had three daughters, Eve Louise, Patricia Robins (a.k.a. Claire Lorrimer) who became another best-selling author, and Anne Eleanor.[8] In 1938, the marriage ended in divorce, after Robins met O\\'Neill Pearson in Egypt,[9] they married in 1939. However, like Agatha Christie, Robins continued to publish most of her books under her first married name.[1]\\nWhen she left school, Denise Klein went to work as a journalist for the D. C. Thomson Press, then became a freelance writer. She began to follow in her mother\\'s footsteps when her first novel was published in 1924. Her serial What is Love? ran in The Star from December 1925 to February 1926.[10] Her first play, Heatwave, written in collaboration with Roland Pertwee, was produced at the St James\\'s Theatre, London, in 1929.[11] As a writer of fiction, Denise Klein wrote under a variety of pen-names, including Denise Chesterton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray, Hervey Hamilton and Julia Kane.[1] After marrying Arthur Robins, many of her books were written under her married name.[11]\\nRobins had been writing fiction and getting it published for ten years when in 1927 she met Charles Boon, of Mills & Boon, and she entered her first contract with his firm the same year. Under the terms of this, she was to be paid an advance of thirty pounds for three novels, plus ten per cent terms. Her next contract, for a further six books, delivered an advance of twenty-five pounds for each book, while her third contract, for four more books, paid one hundred pounds for each, plus terms of twelve and a half per cent.[12]\\nThe colourful dust wrappers of Mills & Boon\\'s books were becoming one of their biggest selling points. As an example, the cover of Robins\\'s Women Who Seek (1928) showed a glamorous flapper checking her make-up.[13]\\n\\nRobins became not only Mills & Boon\\'s most prolific writer, but also their best paid. A contract she signed in 1932 paid her £2,400 for eight books, which were those from Shatter the Sky (July 1933) to How Great the Price (June 1935). This was, however, her last work for the firm, as she was then \\'poached\\' by a new publisher, Nicholson & Watson.[14] Of this development, Arthur Boon wrote:[14] Denise Robins, one of our greatest authors, knew she could sell on her name more than other authors could. She was a superstar, and she knew it. Our problem was to find a way to satisfy the superstar. What could Mills & Boon offer a superstar? Superstars weren\\'t grateful.\\nRobins gave her version of events in her autobiography:[11][14] Suddenly a young man named Ivor Nicholson came along – a clever, charming journalist who, with the wealth of Bernard Watson to back his new venture, launched a new publishing house – Ivor Nicholson & Watson. They wanted my name on their list. They tempted me with what was the biggest offer I had ever received from any literary quarter, a cheque for one thousand pounds, free, gratis, and for which I need do no work. It was merely for signing the contract! I did not go behind Charles Boon\\'s back. I told him the facts. Unfortunately he was so annoyed by Ivor Nicholson\\'s offer that he refused to compete and at once released me from my contract with his firm. Somewhat reluctantly I left my old publishers and became the new Nicholson & Watson \\'star\\' author.The first book Robins wrote for Nicholson was Life and Love (1935), which was launched with a huge publicity campaign. Robins\\'s first photo opportunity was a visit to Liverpool to open a new lending library, and the slogan \\'Robins for Romance\\' was posted on London buses.[14]\\nJoseph McAleer has described Robins as \"the recognised mistress of the punishing kiss device.[15]\\nDuring her long career as a writer, from about 1917 until her death in 1985, Robins certainly wrote more than one hundred and sixty books. She was dubbed by the Daily Graphic \"the queen of romantic fiction\".[4]\\nShe was elected as President of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association in 1961.[9]\\nIn 1965, Robins published her autobiography, Stranger Than Fiction, summarised thus: \"Apart from writing nearly two hundred novels that have brought her millions of fans throughout the world, Denise Robins led a remarkable life. Her unhappy childhood did not sour her belief in love. Here is her own story.\"[16][17]\\nAt the time of her death in 1985, Robins\\'s books had been translated into fifteen languages and had sold more than one hundred million copies. In 1984, they were borrowed more than one and a half million times from British libraries. Among her best-selling works were House of the Seventh Cross, Khamsin and Dark Corridor.[2] In October 2011 the first dozen of her novels were released in e-book format.[18]\\nSome of her novels have been reedited under different titles or as Denise Robins[17]\\n',\n",

Stith introduced her to literary agent Perry Knowlton.[13][15] Knowlton represented her based on an unfinished first novel, tentatively titled Cross Stitch. Her first book deal was for a trilogy, the first novel plus two then-unwritten sequels. Her US publishers changed the first book\\'s title to Outlander, but the title remained unchanged in the UK According to Gabaldon, her British publishers liked the title Cross Stitch, a play on \"a stitch in time\"; however, the American publisher said it \"sounded too much like embroidery\" and wanted a more \"adventurous\" title.[13] When her second book was finished, Gabaldon resigned her faculty position at Arizona State University to become a full-time author.[10]\\nAs of 2021[update], the Outlander series comprises nine published novels. The ninth installment, Go Tell the Bees That I am Gone, was published on November 23, 2021.[16] Gabaldon also published The Exile (An Outlander Graphic Novel) in 2010.

The spin-off series currently consists of five novellas and three novels, which all take place between 1756 and 1761, during the events of Gabaldon\\'s Voyager.[39][40] They can be generally categorized as historical mysteries, and the three novels are shorter and focus on fewer plot threads than the main Outlander books.[40]\\nProfessor Gabaldon\\'s research works included:\\nThe Outlander series has been released in unabridged (read by Davina Porter) and abridged (read by Geraldine James) audiobooks. Several of the Lord John books have been released in audiobook form, read by Jeff Woodman.\\nA television adaptation of the Outlander series premiered on Starz in the US on August 9, 2014.[3] Gabaldon made a cameo appearance as Iona MacTavish in the August 2014 episode \"The Gathering\".[41] Gabaldon is a paid consultant for the show,[42] and wrote the screenplay for the 2016 season 2 episode \"Vengeance Is Mine\".[37]\\nIn 2010 Gabaldon adapted the first third of Outlander into The Exile: An Outlander Graphic Novel, illustrated by Hoang Nguyen.[43][44][45] The same year, a 14-song cycle based on Outlander was released under the title Outlander: The Musical.[46][47][48]\\nGabaldon\\'s Outlander won the Romance Writers of America\\'s RITA Award for Best Romance of 1991.[49] A Breath of Snow and Ashes (2005) debuted at #1 on The New York Times Hardcover Fiction Best-Seller List[50][51] and won the Quill Award for Science Fiction/Fantasy/Horror.[52] In 2007, The Montreal Gazette noted that Gabaldon\\'s books \"are in demand in 24 countries in 19 languages\", and that the author \"continues to churn out one bestseller after another.\"[10] By 2012 her novels had been published in 27 countries and 24 languages.[5]\\nLord John and the Private Matter reached No. 8 on The New York Times Hardcover Fiction Best-Seller List in 2003.[53] In 2007, Lord John and the Brotherhood of the Blade debuted at #1,[54] and the Hand of Devils collection reached No. 24 on The New York Times Hardcover Fiction Best-Seller List.[55] The Scottish Prisoner debuted at #6 on The New York Times E-Book Fiction Best-Seller List in 2011,[56] and the novella A Plague of Zombies was nominated for an Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America for the “Best Short Mystery Story” the same year.[57] Reviewing the Lord John series, Publishers Weekly said that \"Gabaldon\\'s prose is crisply elegant\"[58] and that she \"brings an effusive joy to her fiction that proves infectious even for readers unfamiliar with her work or the period.\"[59]\\n',\n",

Over thirty-five million copies of her books are in print, and she had at least 24 New York Times Bestsellers.[1] She also wrote a novel for young adults called A Girl Named Summer.\\nGarwood\\'s novel For the Roses was adapted for the television feature Rose Hill.[2]\\nJulie Garwood born Julia Elizabeth Murphy[3] and was raised in Kansas City, Missouri, the sixth of seven children in a large Irish family.[2] She was the daughter of Felicita “Flip” Murphy, née Kennedy and Thomas Murphy[4] and had five sisters: Sharon, Kathleen, Marilyn, Mary Colette \"Cookie\", and Joanne, and one brother: Tom. After having a tonsillectomy at age six, because she missed so much school, she did not learn to read as the other children her age did.  She was eleven before her mother realized Garwood was unable to read.  A math teacher, Sister Elizabeth, devoted the entire summer that year to teaching Garwood how to read, and how to enjoy the stories she was reading.  This teacher had such an impact on Garwood\\'s life that she named her daughter Elizabeth.[1][5]\\nWhile studying to be a registered nurse, Garwood took a Russian history course and became intrigued by history, choosing to pursue a double major in history and nursing.  A professor, impressed by the quality of her essays, convinced Garwood to write.  The result was a children\\'s book, A Girl Named Summer, and her first historical novel, Gentle Warrior.[5]\\nGarwood married young and had three children: Gerry, Bryan, and Elizabeth. The family resided in Leawood, Kansas. Although Garwood enjoyed her writing, she was not intending to pursue a career as an author.  As a young wife and mother she took several freelance writing jobs, and wrote longer stories to amuse herself.  After her youngest child started school, Garwood began attending local writers\\' conferences, where she soon met an agent.  The agent sold both her children\\'s book and her historical novel, and soon the publisher requested more historical romances.[2]\\nGarwood\\'s novels are particularly known for the quirkiness of her heroines, who tend to have an ability to get lost anywhere, clumsiness, and a \"charming ability to obfuscate and change the direction of conversations to the consternation, frustration, but eventual acceptance of the other party.\"[5] She was not afraid to tackle difficult issues, and one of her books deals with spousal abuse.\\nDespite her success in the historical romance genre, Garwood ventured into a new genre and began writing contemporary romantic suspense novels.  Like her historicals, these contemporaries still focus on family relationships, whether between blood relatives or groups of friends who have styled themselves as a family.[1]\\nHer first contemporary offering, Heartbreaker, was optioned for film and was serialized in Cosmopolitan.\\nGarwood died at her home in Kansas on June 8, 2023, at the age of 78.[6]\\n(Under the pseudonym Emily Chase, Julie Garwood wrote one Young Adult novel).\\n',\n",

While growing up in San Diego, California, Gerritsen often dreamt of writing her own Nancy Drew novels.[4] Her first name is Terry; she decided to feminize it when she was a writer of romance novels.[2]  Although she longed to be a writer, her family had reservations about the sustainability of a writing career, prompting Gerritsen to choose a career in medicine.[5] In 1975, Gerritsen graduated from Stanford University with a BA in anthropology, intrigued by the ranges of human behavior.[6] She went on to study medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.[5] She received her medical degree in 1979 and started work as a physician in Honolulu, Hawaii.[7][8]\\nWhile on maternity leave, she submitted a short story to a statewide fiction contest in the magazine Honolulu. Her story, \"On Choosing the Right Crack Seed\", won first prize and she received $500.[7][9] The story focused on a young male reflecting on a difficult relationship with his mother. Gerritsen claimed the story allowed her to deal with her own childhood turmoil, including the repeated suicide attempts of her mother.[7]\\nInspired by the romance novels she enjoyed reading while working as a doctor, Gerritsen\\'s first novels were romantic thrillers.[7] After two unpublished \"practice novels\", Call After Midnight was bought by publisher Harlequin Intrigue in 1986 and published a year later.[10] Gerritsen subsequently wrote eight romantic thrillers for Harlequin Intrigue and Harper Paperbacks.[7]\\nIn 1996, Gerritsen wrote Harvest, her first medical thriller.[10] The plot was inspired by a conversation with a retired homicide detective who had recently traveled in Russia. He told her young orphans were vanishing from Moscow streets, and police believed the kidnapped children were being shipped abroad as organ donors.[11] Harvest was Gerritsen\\'s first hardcover novel, and it marked her debut on the New York Times bestseller list at number thirteen.[12] Following Harvest, Gerritsen wrote three more bestselling medical thrillers: Life Support,[13] Bloodstream,[14] and Gravity.[15]\\nIn 2001, Gerritsen\\'s first crime thriller, The Surgeon, was published and introduced homicide detective Jane Rizzoli. Although a secondary character in The Surgeon, Rizzoli has been a central focus of 13 subsequent novels (see below) pairing her with medical examiner Dr. Maura Isles.[16] The books inspired the Rizzoli & Isles television series starring Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander.[17] Gerritsen also made an appearance in the series\\' final season as a writer who helps Isles establish herself in the literary field.[18]\\nAlthough most of her recent books have been in the Rizzoli/Isles series, in 2007 Gerritsen wrote a stand-alone historical thriller titled The Bone Garden.  A tale of gruesome murders, the book is set primarily in 1830s Boston and includes a character based on Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes.[19][20]\\nGerritsen\\'s books have been published in 40 countries and have sold 25 million copies.[16]\\nFilm and television\\nAdrift (1993)\\n\\nRizzoli & Isles  (2010)\\nIsland Zero (2018)\\nMagnificent Beast (2022)\\nGerritsen co-wrote the story and screenplay for Adrift, which aired on CBS as Movie of the Week in 1993 and starred Kate Jackson and Bruce Greenwood.[21]\\nShe has contributed essays in volumes published by Mystery Writers of America and International Thriller Writers.

Krentz is the author of a string of New York Times bestsellers under seven different pseudonyms. Now, she only uses three names. Under her married name she writes contemporary romantic-suspense. She uses Amanda Quick for her novels of historical romantic-suspense. She uses her maiden name for futuristic/paranormal romantic-suspense writing.\\nOver 35 million copies of Krentz\\'s novels are in print. With Sweet Starfire, she created the futuristic romance subgenre, and further expanded the boundaries of the genre in 1996 with Amaryllis, the first paranormal futuristic romantic suspense novel. She is an outspoken advocate for the romance genre and has been the recipient of the Susan Koppelman Award for Feminist Studies.\\nJayne Ann Castle was born on March 28, 1948, in Cobb, California, United States.[1] She and her two brothers were raised by their mother, Alberta, in Borrego Springs for the first decade of Jayne\\'s life.\\nShe earned a B.A in History at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1970.[2] Fearful that she would be unable to find a job using her degree, she elected to obtain her graduate degree in Library Science from San Jose State University. Immediately after graduation she married Frank Krentz, an engineer, whom she had met at San Jose State. The couple moved to the Virgin Islands, where Krentz worked for a year as an elementary school librarian, a time she refers to as \"an unmitigated career disaster\".[1] Realizing that she enjoyed being a librarian but not the aspects of teaching that working in an elementary school required, Krentz moved into the higher levels of academia, including a stint in the Duke University library system.[1] Krentz and her husband later moved to Seattle, Washington.\\nKrentz has been generous in sharing her wealth with libraries. She established the Castle Humanities Fund at UCSC\\'s University Library to allow the library to purchase additional books and has given money to 15 Seattle-area elementary schools to enhance their library budgets. She is also a member of the Advisory Board for the Writers Programs at the University of Washington extension program.[2][3]\\nWhile working at Duke, Krentz began writing stories her way, combining elements of romance novels with paranormal twists. For six years she wrote and mailed proposals for new novels, consistently receiving rejection letters.[1] She claims to have tried to stop writing several times during that period, but that it became a \"compulsion\".[3] During this time she and her family moved to Seattle, Washington to further her husband\\'s aerospace career.\\nKrentz continued writing, and, in 1979, she sold her first novel, Gentle Pirate.[1] That novel and several that followed were published within various category romance lines, as that was the only method in which contemporary romance was published. As more publishers began to release single-title contemporary romances, Krentz shifted into writing only single-title novels.[4]\\nHer first novels were released under her birth name, Jayne Castle. Krentz signed a contract allowing one of her publishers to own the name, and, after leaving that publisher, Krentz was unable to use that name on new works for ten years. This led to the creation of several pseudonyms, including Jayne Taylor, Jayne Bentley, Stephanie James and Amanda Glass. By the mid-1980s she had begun using only her married name, Jayne Ann Krentz, for all of her contemporary romance novels.[1]\\nHer 1986 novel, Sweet Starfire, was a futuristic romance, a subgenre that combined elements of romance novels and science fiction. The novel was a \"classic road trip romance\" which just happened to be set in a separate galaxy. In 1987 she published a second futuristic romance, Crystal Flame, which again allowed for a \"traditional romance plot unfold[ing] in an extraordinary world\".[5]\\nThe success of these books encouraged Krentz to try to write a real historical romance with a humorous twist, which she released under the pseudonym Amanda Quick.[5]\\nShe began writing paranormal futuristic novels of romantic suspense in 1996. Released under her maiden name, Jayne Castle, these novels are set far in the future in a world where everyone has a psychic talent and respectable people use marriage agencies instead of choosing their own mates. As is customary in her writing, in each case the protagonists have a mystery to solve or a villain to defeat.[6]\\nPsychic themes appear throughout Krentz\\'s work. In 2006 she began a new series, called The Arcane Society, which includes books written as Amanda Quick (historical setting), Jayne Ann Krentz (contemporary setting), and Jayne Castle (futuristic setting). The books tell the stories of members of the Arcane Society for the psychically gifted, and each hero and heroine has his or her own psychic power. The books feature a mystery for the protagonists to solve while they are learning to deal with their psychic abilities.[7] The heroes of her novels are always alpha males who are as strong and determined as her heroines.[8]\\nMore than 120 of Krentz\\'s romance novels have been published, with 32 placing on the New York Times Bestseller List. In total, there are over 23 million copies of her books in print.[3]\\nKrentz\\'s novel The Waiting Game was adapted for the Harlequin Romance Series teleplay in 2001.\\nHer books have won many awards. Krentz has been nominated 22 times for Romantic Times Reviewers\\' Choice Awards, winning in 1995 for Trust Me and in 2004 for Falling Awake.[9] She has also received a Romantic Times Career Achievement Award.[9]\\nAn outspoken advocate of the merits of romantic fiction, Krentz maintains that \"[p]opular fiction encapsulates and reinforces many of our most fundamental cultural values. Romance is among the most enduring because it addresses the values of family and human emotional bonds.\" To help educate the public about the genre she became the editor of and a contributor to Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women: Romance Writers on the Appeal of the Romance, a non-fiction essay collection that won the prestigious Susan Koppelman Award for Feminist Studies.[3] Krentz was the inspiration for, and first recipient of, the Romantic Times Jane Austen Award, created to \"honor those in the romance community who have significantly impacted our genre\".[10]\\n',\n",

She was raised in Washington, D.C., she earned a B.A. in American Thought and Civilization from George Washington University and an M.A. in American Studies from the University of Maryland.  On 30 June 1963, she married Norman S. Glick, a mathematician for the Defense Department. They have two children: Elissa, a librarian, and Ethan, a Foreign Service Officer.\\nAfter several years as a stay-at-home mother, Glick decided to pursue a career.  She enrolled in a course at a local community college to help her choose a career.  The class helped her identify a talent for writing.  For the next few years, Glick wrote articles for local newspapers, and sold several articles on a freelance basis to The Washington Post and the Baltimore Sun.[2]\\nIn 1977, Glick published a book about making dollhouse furniture with her friend Nancy Baggett. Two years later, she published two more dollhouse books. With Baggett, Glick has written many cookbooks focusing on healthy eating; she also writes cookbooks alone.

       " '\\nElinor Glyn (née Sutherland; 17 October 1864 – 23 September 1943) was a British novelist and scriptwriter who specialised in romantic fiction, which was considered scandalous for its time, although her works are relatively tame by modern standards. She popularized the concept of the it-girl, and had tremendous influence on early 20th-century popular culture and, possibly, on the careers of notable Hollywood stars such as Rudolph Valentino, Gloria Swanson and, especially, Clara Bow.\\nElinor Sutherland was born on 17 October 1864 in Saint Helier, Jersey, in the Channel Islands.[1] She was the younger daughter of Douglas Sutherland (1838–1865), a civil engineer of Scottish descent, and his wife Elinor Saunders (1841–1937), of an Anglo-French family that had settled in Canada.[1] Her father was said to be related to the Lords Duffus.[2][3][a]\\nHer father died when she was two months old; her mother returned to the parental home in Guelph, in what was then Upper Canada, British North America (now Ontario) with her two daughters.[4] Here, young Elinor was taught by her grandmother, Lucy Anne Saunders (née Willcocks), daughter of Sir Richard Willcocks, a magistrate in the early Irish police force, who helped to suppress the Emmet Rising in 1803.[5][6] Richard\\'s brother Joseph also settled in Upper Canada, publishing one of the first opposition papers there, pursuing liberty, and dying a rebel in 1814. The Anglo-Irish grandmother instructed young Elinor in the ways of upper-class society. This training not only gave her an entrée into aristocratic circles on her return to Europe, it also led to her reputation as an authority on style and breeding when she worked in Hollywood in the 1920s. Her grandfather on her mother\\'s side, Thomas Saunders (1795–1873) was a direct descendant of the Saunders family who had possessed Pitchcott Manor in Buckinghamshire for several centuries.[7]\\nThe family lived in Guelph for seven years at a stone home that still stands near the University of Guelph.[4]   Glyn\\'s mother remarried in 1871 to David Kennedy, and the family returned to Jersey when Glyn was about eight years old.[8] Her subsequent education at her stepfather\\'s house was by governesses.[1] Glyn\\'s elder sister grew up to be Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, famous as a fashion designer under the name Lucile.\\nElinor married on 27 April 1892, at the age of 28. Her husband was Clayton Louis Glyn (13 July 1857 – 10 November 1915), a wealthy but spendthrift barrister and Essex landowner who was descended from Sir Richard Carr Glyn, an 18th-century Lord Mayor of London.[9] The couple had two daughters, Margot and Juliet, but the marriage foundered on mutual incompatibility.[citation needed]\\nGlyn began writing in 1900, starting with Visits of Elizabeth, serialised in The World,[1] a book based on letters to her mother, although Lady Angela Forbes claimed, in her memoirs, that Glyn used her as the prototype of Elizabeth.[10] As Glyn\\'s husband fell into debt from around 1908, she wrote at least one novel a year to keep up her standard of living.[citation needed]\\nHer marriage was troubled, and Glyn began having affairs with various British aristocrats. Her novel Three Weeks, about a Balkan queen who seduces a young British aristocrat, was allegedly inspired by her affair with Lord Alistair Innes Ker, brother of the Duke of Roxburghe, sixteen years her junior, which scandalized Edwardian society.[1]\\nAround 1907, Glyn toured the United States, resulting in her book Elizabeth visits America (1909).[1][11][12]\\nGlyn had a long affair between circa 1907 and 1916 with Lord Curzon, the former Viceroy of India.[13][b] Society painter Philip de László painted her in 1912, when she was 48. Curzon is presumed to have commissioned it and had given Glyn the sapphires she wears in the portrait.[14][c] In 1915, Curzon leased Montacute House, in South Somerset, for him and Glyn, now a widow as her husband had died that autumn at the age of 58 after several years of illness.  Curzon asked Glyn to decorate Montacute House and with Glyn away from London, Curzon courted heiress Grace Duggan. Glyn learned of Curzon and Duggan\\'s engagement from the morning papers and burnt 500 love letters in the bedroom fireplace, never speaking to Curzon again.[15]\\nGlyn pioneered risqué, and sometimes erotic, romantic fiction aimed at a female readership, a radical idea for its time. In her novel The Man and the Moment (1914),[1] she coined the use of the word it  to mean a characteristic that \"draws all others with magnetic force. With \\'IT\\' you win all men if you are a woman–and all women if you are a man. \\'IT\\' can be a quality of the mind as well as a physical attraction.\"[16] Her use of the word is often erroneously taken to simply be a euphemism for sexuality or sex appeal.[17]\\nDuring World War I, Glyn became a war correspondent, working in France.[1]  At the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, 28 June 1919, Glyn was one of only two women present.[1]\\nAfter the war, Glyn went to Hollywood, for the filming of her novel The Great Moment.[1][19] In 1919, she signed a contract with William Randolph Hearst\\'s International Magazine Company to write stories and articles that included a clause for the motion picture rights.[20] She was brought over from England to write screenplays by the Famous Players–Lasky production company.[21]\\nShe wrote for Cosmopolitan and other Hearst press titles, advising women on how to keep their men and imparting health and beauty tips. The Elinor Glyn System of Writing (1922) gives insights into writing for Hollywood studios and magazine editors of the time.[22]\\nGlyn was one of the most famous women screenwriters in the 1920s. She has 28 story or screenwriting credits, three producing credits, and two credits for directing.[19] Her first script was called The Great Moment and starred Gloria Swanson. \\nGlyn was responsible for many screenplays in the 1920s, including Six Hours (1923) and the film version of her novel Three Weeks (1924).[19] Other films she wrote were His Hour (1924), directed by King Vidor; Love\\'s Blindness (1926), about a marriage that is done strictly for financial reasons; Man and Maid (1925), about a man who must choose between two women; The Only Thing (1925); and Ritzy. Three screenplays based on Glyn\\'s novels and a story in the mid to late twenties, Man and Maid, The Only Thing, and Ritzy, did not do well at the box office, despite the success Glyn gained with her first project, The Great Moment, which was in the same genre.[19]  In 1930 she wrote her first non-silent film, Such Men Are Dangerous, her last screenplay in the United States.[19]\\nApart from being a scriptwriter for the silent movie industry, working for both MGM and Paramount Pictures in Hollywood in the mid-1920s, she had a brief career as one of the earliest female directors.[23] In addition to being credited as an author, adapter, and co-producer on the 1927 film adaptation of It, she also made a cameo appearance.[21]\\nShe is credited[who?] with the re-styling of Gloria Swanson from giggly starlet to elegant star. The duo connected again when Beyond the Rocks was made into a silent film that was released in 1922. The Sam Wood–directed film stars Swanson and Rudolph Valentino as a romantic pair. In 1927, Glyn helped to make a star of actress Clara Bow, for whom she coined the sobriquet \"the It girl.\" In 1928, Bow also starred in Red Hair, which was based on Glyn\\'s 1905 novel of the same name.[24] The film was a comedy vehicle to demonstrate the supposed passion of red-haired people.[25]\\nGlyn returned home to England in 1929 in part because of tax demands. With her return she set out to form her own production company, Elinor Glyn Ltd. Her family had established a company in 1924, Elinor Glyn Ltd, to which she signed her copyrights, receiving an income from the firm and an annuity in later life. The firm was an early pioneer of cross-media branding.[26]   After she started the company, she began working as a film director as well. Paying out of her own pocket, she directed Knowing Men in 1930, which showed a more traditionalist view of men as sexual harassers. The project was a disaster, and the screenwriter Edward Knoblock sued Glyn so that the work could not be released. Elinor Glyn Ltd produced a second film in 1930, The Price of Things, which was also unsuccessful and was never released in the US. As her company failed and she exhausted her finances, Glyn decided to retire from film work and instead focus on her first passion, writing novels.[21]\\nAfter a short illness, Glyn died on 23 September 1943, at 39 Royal Avenue, Chelsea, London, aged 78,[27] and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. Her ashes lie above the door to the Jewish Shrine at the west end of the columbarium.\\n',\n",

She wrote under her first married name and under the pen-names: Denise Chesterton, Eve Vaill, \\'Anne Llewellyn\\', Hervey Hamilton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray and Julia Kane, producing short stories, plays, and about 170 Gothic romance novels. In 1965, Robins published her autobiography, Stranger Than Fiction. At the time of her death in 1985, Robins\\'s books had been translated into fifteen languages and had sold more than one hundred million copies. In 1984, they were borrowed more than one and a half million times from British libraries.[2]\\nShe was the daughter of the novelist K. C. Groom, and mother of romance novelist Patricia Robins. Some other members of her family are well-known artists.\\nRobins was born Denise Naomi Klein on 1 February 1897 in London, England, the daughter of Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell, who was also a prolific author who wrote under several names, and of her first husband, Herman Klein, who was a professor of music and journalist. Of Russian Jewish ancestry, he had been born in Norwich in 1856. Her mother Kathleen Clarice had been born in Melbourne, Australia, on 11 March 1872 and was the daughter of George Cornwell and his wife Jemima Ridpath, married in 1850.[3] George Cornwell was a railway guard who became a successful gold prospector in Australia, operating several mines, and a notable building contractor. His eldest daughter, Alice Cornwell, born 1852, was spectacularly rich by the 1890s, returning to England and buying the Sunday Times newspaper.[4][5]\\nHer parents had married in 1890. He had a daughter Sibyl Klein, from a previous marriage, and they had two sons: Adrian Bernard Klein (1892–1969) and Daryl Klein (1894), before the birth of Denise Naomi Klein (1897–1985). The childhood of Denise, Adrian and Daryl Klein was far from settled. Kathleen Klein began an affair with a Worcestershire Regiment officer called Herbert Berkeley Dealtry, who was much younger than her husband, and little than herself, and when Hermann Klein became aware of it he filed a petition for divorce, which was granted in December 1901. Kathleen then married Dealtry.[4]\\nIn 1905, the Dealtrys had some serious troubles in connection with the promotion of dog shows, which they had been drawn into by Kathleen\\'s sister Alice Stennard Robinson, a leading member of the Ladies\\' Kennel Association (founded 1904) and the National Cat Club. Somehow, the money from the first dog show went missing, and the Dealtrys held a second show to pay the prize money owed on the first. After the second show, prize winners sued Dealtry, which led to his being declared bankrupt.[4] The family then lived in America for a few years but, by 1908, Kathleen (or \\'Kit\\') Dealtry was back in London, writing Christian novels.[6] In 1918 she married for a third time and wrote at least three books[7] as Mrs Sydney Groom.[4]\\nHer eldest brother Adrian Bernard Klein also became a writer, he was an artist and wrote books on photography and cinematography. After serving as an officer in the British Army, he became a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and changed his name to Adrian Cornwell-Clyne.[4]\\nDenise Naomi Klein married firstly Arthur Robins in 1918, a corn broker on the Baltic Exchange,[8] they had three daughters, Eve Louise, Patricia Robins (a.k.a. Claire Lorrimer) who became another best-selling author, and Anne Eleanor.[8] In 1938, the marriage ended in divorce, after Robins met O\\'Neill Pearson in Egypt,[9] they married in 1939. However, like Agatha Christie, Robins continued to publish most of her books under her first married name.[1]\\nWhen she left school, Denise Klein went to work as a journalist for the D. C. Thomson Press, then became a freelance writer. She began to follow in her mother\\'s footsteps when her first novel was published in 1924. Her serial What is Love? ran in The Star from December 1925 to February 1926.[10] Her first play, Heatwave, written in collaboration with Roland Pertwee, was produced at the St James\\'s Theatre, London, in 1929.[11] As a writer of fiction, Denise Klein wrote under a variety of pen-names, including Denise Chesterton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray, Hervey Hamilton and Julia Kane.[1] After marrying Arthur Robins, many of her books were written under her married name.[11]\\nRobins had been writing fiction and getting it published for ten years when in 1927 she met Charles Boon, of Mills & Boon, and she entered her first contract with his firm the same year. Under the terms of this, she was to be paid an advance of thirty pounds for three novels, plus ten per cent terms. Her next contract, for a further six books, delivered an advance of twenty-five pounds for each book, while her third contract, for four more books, paid one hundred pounds for each, plus terms of twelve and a half per cent.[12]\\nThe colourful dust wrappers of Mills & Boon\\'s books were becoming one of their biggest selling points. As an example, the cover of Robins\\'s Women Who Seek (1928) showed a glamorous flapper checking her make-up.[13]\\n\\nRobins became not only Mills & Boon\\'s most prolific writer, but also their best paid. A contract she signed in 1932 paid her £2,400 for eight books, which were those from Shatter the Sky (July 1933) to How Great the Price (June 1935). This was, however, her last work for the firm, as she was then \\'poached\\' by a new publisher, Nicholson & Watson.[14] Of this development, Arthur Boon wrote:[14] Denise Robins, one of our greatest authors, knew she could sell on her name more than other authors could. She was a superstar, and she knew it. Our problem was to find a way to satisfy the superstar. What could Mills & Boon offer a superstar? Superstars weren\\'t grateful.\\nRobins gave her version of events in her autobiography:[11][14] Suddenly a young man named Ivor Nicholson came along – a clever, charming journalist who, with the wealth of Bernard Watson to back his new venture, launched a new publishing house – Ivor Nicholson & Watson. They wanted my name on their list. They tempted me with what was the biggest offer I had ever received from any literary quarter, a cheque for one thousand pounds, free, gratis, and for which I need do no work. It was merely for signing the contract! I did not go behind Charles Boon\\'s back. I told him the facts. Unfortunately he was so annoyed by Ivor Nicholson\\'s offer that he refused to compete and at once released me from my contract with his firm. Somewhat reluctantly I left my old publishers and became the new Nicholson & Watson \\'star\\' author.The first book Robins wrote for Nicholson was Life and Love (1935), which was launched with a huge publicity campaign. Robins\\'s first photo opportunity was a visit to Liverpool to open a new lending library, and the slogan \\'Robins for Romance\\' was posted on London buses.[14]\\nJoseph McAleer has described Robins as \"the recognised mistress of the punishing kiss device.[15]\\nDuring her long career as a writer, from about 1917 until her death in 1985, Robins certainly wrote more than one hundred and sixty books. She was dubbed by the Daily Graphic \"the queen of romantic fiction\".[4]\\nShe was elected as President of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association in 1961.[9]\\nIn 1965, Robins published her autobiography, Stranger Than Fiction, summarised thus: \"Apart from writing nearly two hundred novels that have brought her millions of fans throughout the world, Denise Robins led a remarkable life. Her unhappy childhood did not sour her belief in love. Here is her own story.\"[16][17]\\nAt the time of her death in 1985, Robins\\'s books had been translated into fifteen languages and had sold more than one hundred million copies.

       " '\\nJanet Evanovich (née Schneider; April 22, 1943) is an American writer. She began her career writing short contemporary romance novels under the pen name Steffie Hall, but gained fame authoring a series of contemporary mysteries featuring Stephanie Plum, a former lingerie buyer from Trenton, New Jersey, who becomes a bounty hunter to make ends meet after losing her job. The novels in this series have been on The New York Times, USA Today, Wall Street Journal and Amazon bestseller lists. Evanovich has had her last seventeen Plums debut at #1 on the NY Times Best Sellers list and eleven of them have hit #1 on USA Today Best-Selling Books list. She has over two hundred million books in print worldwide, and her books have been translated into over 40 languages.\\nEvanovich is a second-generation American born in South River, New Jersey, to a machinist and a housewife.[1] After attending South River High School,[2] she became the first in her family to attend college when she enrolled at Douglass College, part of Rutgers University, to study art.[3][4]\\nWhen Evanovich had children, she chose to become a housewife like her mother. In her thirties, she began writing novels.[1] To learn the art of writing dialog, Evanovich took lessons in improv acting.[4] For ten years, she attempted to write the Great American Novel, finishing three manuscripts that she was unable to sell. After someone suggested she try writing romance novels, Evanovich read several romances and discovered that she enjoyed the genre. She wrote two romances and submitted them for publishing.[5] Still unable to find a publisher, Evanovich stopped writing and signed with a temporary employment agency. Several months after beginning work for them, she received an offer to buy her second romance manuscript for $2,000, which she considered an \"astounding sum.\"[4]\\nThat novel, Hero at Large, was published in 1987 in the Second Chance Love category line under the pseudonym Steffie Hall.[1] The following year she began writing for Bantam Loveswept under her own name.[5] For the next five years she continued to write category romances for Loveswept.[4] Her work within the romance novel genre helped her learn to create likable characters and attractive leading men.[6] In this time, Evanovich also became known for the humor that filled her novels. She believes that \"it\\'s very important to take a comic approach. If we can laugh at something, we can face it.\"[7]\\nAfter finishing her twelfth romance, however, Evanovich realized that she was more interested in writing the action sequences in her novels than the sex scenes. Her editors were not interested in her change of heart, so Evanovich took the next eighteen months to formulate a plan for what she actually wanted to write.[1]\\nShe quickly decided that she wanted to write romantic adventure novels.[8] She wanted to include humor, romance and adventure in her work and this fit into her style of mystery novel.[9] Unlike the style of romance novels, her books would be told in first person narrative.[4]  Her new type of writing should contain heroes and heroines, as well as \"a sense of family and community.\"[1] In that vein, she intended her new style of writing to be based on the TV sitcom model. Like Seinfeld, her new books would have a central character that the rest of the cast of characters revolve around.[8]\\nInspired by the Robert De Niro movie Midnight Run, Evanovich decided that her heroine would be a bounty hunter.[1] This occupation provided more freedom for Evanovich as a writer, as bounty hunters do not have a set work schedule and are not forced to wear a uniform. The profession is also \"romanticised to some extent.\"[7] To become acquainted with the demands of the career, Evanovich spent a great deal of time shadowing bond enforcement agents. She also researched more about the city of Trenton, where she wanted her books to be set.[1]\\nIn 1994, her initial romantic adventure, One for the Money, was published to good reviews.[1] This was the first of a light-hearted series of mysteries starring barely competent bounty hunter Stephanie Plum. One for the Money was named a New York Times notable book, a Publishers Weekly Best Book of 1994 and a USA Today Best Bet.[10]\\nEvanovich has continued to write romantic adventures starring Stephanie Plum. The sixth book in the series, Hot Six, was the first of her novels to reach number one on the New York Times Best Seller List.[3] Her subsequent Plum novels have each debuted at number one.[11] All About Romance has described her as the \"rare breed of romance author who has left the genre and yet not alienated her many romance fans.\"[5]\\nThe Plum novels have taken many attributes from Evanovich\\'s own life. Evanovich shares many commonalities with her character Stephanie Plum. Both are from New Jersey, both devour Cheetos, both had owned a hamster, and both have shared \"similar embarrassing experiences.\"[4] The character Grandma Mazur is loosely based on Evanovich\\'s \"Grandma Fanny\" and \"Aunt Lena.\" Evanovich claims the spirited elderly lady is \"who I want to be when I grow up.\"[6]\\nShortly before One for the Money was released, Evanovich sold the movie rights to Columbia TriStar for $1 million.[3] Lions Gate Entertainment released One for the Money on January 27, 2012. The film stars Katherine Heigl as Stephanie Plum, Sherri Shepherd from The View as Lula, Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur, Jason O\\'Mara as Joe Morelli, and Daniel Sunjata as Ranger.  It was directed by Julie Anne Robinson.[12]\\nHer latest Stephanie Plum novel, Dirty Thirty  was released October 31, 2023.\\nIn 2016 Evanovich released the first book, Curious Minds, in her new Knight & Moon mystery series.  Co-authored with Phoef Sutton, the book introduces two new characters, Emerson Knight and Riley Moon.  Emerson Knight is a rich, eccentric introvert with little-to-no sense of social etiquette.  He is also brilliant and handsome.  Riley Moon is a recent Harvard Law and Harvard Business graduate.  Her aggressive Texas spitfire attitude helped her land her dream job as a junior analyst at Blane-Grunwald where Emerson is a client.  Together this unlikely duo finds themselves thrust into solving the most difficult of mysteries.\\nDangerous Minds, the second book in the series, was written by Evanovich and released in June 2017. \\nIn 2010 Evanovich published Wicked Appetite, spinning off the character Diesel from the between the numbers Plum books.  The heroine of Wicked Appetite is sweet cupcake baker Lizzie Tucker, who, unlike Stephanie Plum, can cook.  The \"Wicked\" series is set in Salem, Massachusetts.  In the series, Diesel & Lizzie search for the seven stones of power, each representing a different deadly sin.  Lizzie & Diesel are \"Unmentionables\", humans with additional powers. Their rivals for the stones are Diesel\\'s dark cousin, Gerwulf \"Wulf\" Grimoire, introduced in Plum Spooky and his medieval-esque minion Hatchet.  Lizzie\\'s animal companions are one-eyed Cat 7143 and Carl the Monkey, from Fearless Fourteen and Plum Spooky.   Her friends include Glo, a \"Questionable,\" and Clara Dazzle, an \"Unmentionable\" who lost her powers after congress with another \"Unmentionable.\"  In Wicked Appetite, the stone sought is that incarnating the sin of gluttony.\\nIn 2012 Evanovich published Wicked Business, the second in the series.  In Wicked Business, the stone embodies the sin of lust.  A new villain is introduced, deranged candy heiress Deirdre Early, or Anarchy.  Lizzie, through a selfless act and exchange of body fluids with Wulf, converts the lust stone into the \"icky true love stone\", implying that in the right circumstances, the stones of sin can be converted into stones of virtue.\\nIn 2015 Evanovich teamed up with Phoef Sutton for the third novel in the series, Wicked Charms. The Stone of Avarice (Greed) is the focus of this installment.\\nIn June 2013, Evanovich published the novella \"Pros & Cons\" and the novel The Heist, the first two works in a new series co-written with Lee Goldberg. Since then the series has grown to six novels (The Heist, The Chase, The Job, The Scam, The Pursuit, and The Big Kahuna), two novellas (Pros & Cons and The Shell Game) and one online short-story, The Caper.\\nThe protagonist is FBI special agent Kate O’Hare who has devoted her career to taking down one of the FBI’s most wanted con men and master thieves, Nick Fox. That is until the FBI pairs Kate with the most unlikely person, Nick Fox, to take down criminals. Together they travel the globe skirting on the edge of what is legal and illegal. Kate’s father, Jake O’Hare, a retired Special Forces operative, often aids in their quest.  In June 2016, the fifth novel in the series, The Pursuit, was released.\\nEvanovich began a collaborative effort with Charlotte Hughes because she wanted to see some of her other ideas on paper but did not have the time to write them. This resulted in the \"Full\" series.  The \"Full\" series is set in Beaumont, South Carolina and features Jamie Swift and Maximillian Holt, who meet in the second \"Full\" book, Full Tilt.[6]\\nThe Elsie Hawkins novels are stand alone romances with a supporting character Elsie Hawkins, who is a gun totin\\' retiree, with tight grey curls, who \"doesn\\'t take sass from no one.\"  Elsie drives a 1957 powder blue Cadillac that never seems to sustain damage.  In the Stephanie Plum series, Grandma Mazur and Stephanie drive Uncle Sandor\\'s 1953 powder blue Buick,[13] which has similar indestructibility.\\nIn 2004, Evanovich launched another series with Metro Girl. This book debuted at Number 2 on the New York Times Best Seller List.[11] The heroine is Alexandra Barnaby, an auto mechanic.  Her love interest is Sam Hooker, a hedonistic NASCAR driver.  The \"Motor\" series is set in the southern U.S. states.  Further books in the series include Motor Mouth and Troublemaker 1 & 2 (graphic novels).\\nEvanovich collaborated with Stephen J. Cannell, noted TV writer and producer (A Team, Rockford Files, Baretta, 21 Jump Street), on a book entitled No Chance, which was to be the first book in a new series. It was supposed to be released in October 2007. However, in July 2007, the book was canceled.[14] Cannell died in 2010 of melanoma.\\nEvanovich was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50; made up of entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists and creators who are over the age of 50.[15]\\nDuring the week, Evanovich works eight or more hours per day. On weekends she generally works for an additional four hours each day.[4] She generally creates a brief outline before beginning a new book, with one or two sentences about what will happen in each chapter.[6] Upon the release of a new book, Evanovich regularly goes on book tours. Her book signings attracted thousands of people. Beginning with her third Stephanie Plum book, Three to Get Deadly, and ending with Smokin\\' Seventeen, all of the titles have been chosen from fan submissions.[11]\\nEvanovich lives in Hawaii & North Carolina with her husband, Pete, whom she married in 1964. Her husband, son, and daughter all work for her company, Evanovich Inc.

       " 'Laurell Kaye Hamilton (born February 19, 1963) is an American fantasy and romance writer.[1]  She is best known as the author of two series of stories.\\nHer New York Times-bestselling Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series centers on Anita Blake, a professional zombie raiser, vampire executioner and supernatural consultant for the police, which includes novels, short story collections, and comic books. Six million copies of Anita Blake novels are in print.[2] Her Merry Gentry series centers on Meredith Gentry, Princess of the Unseelie court of Faerie, a private detective facing repeated assassination attempts. Both of these fantasy series follow their protagonists as they gain in power and deal with the dangers of worlds in which creatures of legend live.\\nSeveral media outlets, including USA Today, Entertainment Weekly, and Time have identified her works as significant contributions to the development of the urban-fantasy genre.\\nLaurell Kaye Hamilton was born Laurell Kaye Klein in Heber Springs, Arkansas but grew up in Sims, Indiana with her grandmother Laura Gentry.[3] Her education includes degrees in English and biology from Marion College (now  called Indiana Wesleyan University), a private Evangelical Christian liberal arts college in Marion, Indiana that is affiliated with the Wesleyan Church denomination.  She met Gary Hamilton, whom she married, there.  They have one daughter together, Trinity.[4]\\nHamilton is involved with a number of animal charities, particularly supporting dog rescue efforts and wolf preservation.[5]\\nHamilton currently lives in St. Louis County, Missouri,[6] with her daughter Trinity, and husband Jonathon Green whom she married in 2001.[7]\\nLaurell K. Hamilton is the author of two major book series, spin-off comic books, various anthologies, and other stand-alone titles:\\nEntertainment Weekly and USA Today have identified Hamilton as having a significant impact on urban fantasy.[9][10] In 2008, Time declared that the popularity of the genre \"owes everything to Laurell K. Hamilton\".[11] Authors Courtney Allison Moulton and Kelly Gay have noted Hamilton as an inspiration.[12][13]\\nReader reaction to the series\\'s shift in tone from crime noir thriller to focus more predominantly on the sexual themes in the series has been mixed, starting with Narcissus in Chains when the main character of Anita Blake becomes infected with the ardeur. The ardeur is a supernatural power inadvertently given to Anita by her vampire Master Jean-Claude that gives her massive amounts of power but also demands that she have sexual intercourse with several different people through the course of a day, sometimes in large groups. Reception to these dynamics and to the usage of sexual abuse in later books has been mixed,[3] with some reviewers commenting that the character of Anita spent too much time \"obsessing about whether or not she’s a slut\" while others remarked that the erotic themes enhanced the series.[14] In response to these comments, Hamilton issued a blog entitled \"Dear Negative Reader\" where she addressed a growing number of readers on the Internet that were expressing disappointment in the series\\'s changes.[3][15] In the blog Hamilton told the readers that \"life is too short to read books you don’t like\" and that if they found that the current subject matter pushed \"you past that comfortable envelope of the mundane\" then \"stop reading\" and speculated that some of the readers were either \"closet readers\" or comment based on others\\' opinions.[3][15] The blog entry was negatively received by some readers.[3]\\nCritical reviewers have also commented on the amount of sex in later books, as in a 2006 review in The Boston Globe of Micah. The review was largely negative, stating \"we were not impressed. Hamilton no doubt appeals to romance and erotica lovers, but it does not take long for the clichés and the constant droning about sex to become tiresome.\"[16] Other reviewers for The Kansas City Star and Publishers Weekly also commented on the rise in sexual themes in the series.[17] The reviewer for the Kansas City Star stated that \"After 13 erotically charged books, boredom has reared its ugly head for the 14th novel in Laurell K. Hamilton\\'s Anita Blake series, as eroticism becomes mere description...\" and Publishers Weekly commented that Blood Noir had a \"growing air of ennui, which longtime readers can\\'t help sharing as sex increasingly takes the place of plot and character development\".[18]\\nIn contrast, a Denver Post review of Danse Macabre took a more positive view of the eroticism in Hamilton\\'s work.  Although it noted that \"[t]hose looking for mystery and mayhem on this Anita adventure are out of luck\" it also stated that \"the main attraction of the Anita Blake novels in the past five years has been their erotic novelty\", and \"[f]ew, if any, mainstream novels delve so deeply into pure, unadulterated erotica\".[19]\\n(in Anita\\'s chronological order)\\n\\n',\n",

She wrote under her first married name and under the pen-names: Denise Chesterton, Eve Vaill, \\'Anne Llewellyn\\', Hervey Hamilton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray and Julia Kane, producing short stories, plays, and about 170 Gothic romance novels. In 1965, Robins published her autobiography, Stranger Than Fiction. At the time of her death in 1985, Robins\\'s books had been translated into fifteen languages and had sold more than one hundred million copies. In 1984, they were borrowed more than one and a half million times from British libraries.[2]\\nShe was the daughter of the novelist K. C. Groom, and mother of romance novelist Patricia Robins. Some other members of her family are well-known artists.\\nRobins was born Denise Naomi Klein on 1 February 1897 in London, England, the daughter of Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell, who was also a prolific author who wrote under several names, and of her first husband, Herman Klein, who was a professor of music and journalist. Of Russian Jewish ancestry, he had been born in Norwich in 1856. Her mother Kathleen Clarice had been born in Melbourne, Australia, on 11 March 1872 and was the daughter of George Cornwell and his wife Jemima Ridpath, married in 1850.[3] George Cornwell was a railway guard who became a successful gold prospector in Australia, operating several mines, and a notable building contractor. His eldest daughter, Alice Cornwell, born 1852, was spectacularly rich by the 1890s, returning to England and buying the Sunday Times newspaper.[4][5]\\nHer parents had married in 1890. He had a daughter Sibyl Klein, from a previous marriage, and they had two sons: Adrian Bernard Klein (1892–1969) and Daryl Klein (1894), before the birth of Denise Naomi Klein (1897–1985). The childhood of Denise, Adrian and Daryl Klein was far from settled. Kathleen Klein began an affair with a Worcestershire Regiment officer called Herbert Berkeley Dealtry, who was much younger than her husband, and little than herself, and when Hermann Klein became aware of it he filed a petition for divorce, which was granted in December 1901. Kathleen then married Dealtry.[4]\\nIn 1905, the Dealtrys had some serious troubles in connection with the promotion of dog shows, which they had been drawn into by Kathleen\\'s sister Alice Stennard Robinson, a leading member of the Ladies\\' Kennel Association (founded 1904) and the National Cat Club. Somehow, the money from the first dog show went missing, and the Dealtrys held a second show to pay the prize money owed on the first. After the second show, prize winners sued Dealtry, which led to his being declared bankrupt.[4] The family then lived in America for a few years but, by 1908, Kathleen (or \\'Kit\\') Dealtry was back in London, writing Christian novels.[6] In 1918 she married for a third time and wrote at least three books[7] as Mrs Sydney Groom.[4]\\nHer eldest brother Adrian Bernard Klein also became a writer, he was an artist and wrote books on photography and cinematography. After serving as an officer in the British Army, he became a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and changed his name to Adrian Cornwell-Clyne.[4]\\nDenise Naomi Klein married firstly Arthur Robins in 1918, a corn broker on the Baltic Exchange,[8] they had three daughters, Eve Louise, Patricia Robins (a.k.a. Claire Lorrimer) who became another best-selling author, and Anne Eleanor.[8] In 1938, the marriage ended in divorce, after Robins met O\\'Neill Pearson in Egypt,[9] they married in 1939. However, like Agatha Christie, Robins continued to publish most of her books under her first married name.[1]\\nWhen she left school, Denise Klein went to work as a journalist for the D. C. Thomson Press, then became a freelance writer. She began to follow in her mother\\'s footsteps when her first novel was published in 1924. Her serial What is Love? ran in The Star from December 1925 to February 1926.[10] Her first play, Heatwave, written in collaboration with Roland Pertwee, was produced at the St James\\'s Theatre, London, in 1929.[11] As a writer of fiction, Denise Klein wrote under a variety of pen-names, including Denise Chesterton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray, Hervey Hamilton and Julia Kane.[1] After marrying Arthur Robins, many of her books were written under her married name.[11]\\nRobins had been writing fiction and getting it published for ten years when in 1927 she met Charles Boon, of Mills & Boon, and she entered her first contract with his firm the same year. Under the terms of this, she was to be paid an advance of thirty pounds for three novels, plus ten per cent terms. Her next contract, for a further six books, delivered an advance of twenty-five pounds for each book, while her third contract, for four more books, paid one hundred pounds for each, plus terms of twelve and a half per cent.[12]\\nThe colourful dust wrappers of Mills & Boon\\'s books were becoming one of their biggest selling points. As an example, the cover of Robins\\'s Women Who Seek (1928) showed a glamorous flapper checking her make-up.[13]\\n\\nRobins became not only Mills & Boon\\'s most prolific writer, but also their best paid. A contract she signed in 1932 paid her £2,400 for eight books, which were those from Shatter the Sky (July 1933) to How Great the Price (June 1935). This was, however, her last work for the firm, as she was then \\'poached\\' by a new publisher, Nicholson & Watson.[14] Of this development, Arthur Boon wrote:[14] Denise Robins, one of our greatest authors, knew she could sell on her name more than other authors could. She was a superstar, and she knew it. Our problem was to find a way to satisfy the superstar. What could Mills & Boon offer a superstar? Superstars weren\\'t grateful.\\nRobins gave her version of events in her autobiography:[11][14] Suddenly a young man named Ivor Nicholson came along – a clever, charming journalist who, with the wealth of Bernard Watson to back his new venture, launched a new publishing house – Ivor Nicholson & Watson. They wanted my name on their list. They tempted me with what was the biggest offer I had ever received from any literary quarter, a cheque for one thousand pounds, free, gratis, and for which I need do no work. It was merely for signing the contract! I did not go behind Charles Boon\\'s back. I told him the facts. Unfortunately he was so annoyed by Ivor Nicholson\\'s offer that he refused to compete and at once released me from my contract with his firm. Somewhat reluctantly I left my old publishers and became the new Nicholson & Watson \\'star\\' author.The first book Robins wrote for Nicholson was Life and Love (1935), which was launched with a huge publicity campaign. Robins\\'s first photo opportunity was a visit to Liverpool to open a new lending library, and the slogan \\'Robins for Romance\\' was posted on London buses.[14]\\nJoseph McAleer has described Robins as \"the recognised mistress of the punishing kiss device.[15]\\nDuring her long career as a writer, from about 1917 until her death in 1985, Robins certainly wrote more than one hundred and sixty books. She was dubbed by the Daily Graphic \"the queen of romantic fiction\".[4]\\nShe was elected as President of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association in 1961.[9]\\nIn 1965, Robins published her autobiography, Stranger Than Fiction, summarised thus: \"Apart from writing nearly two hundred novels that have brought her millions of fans throughout the world, Denise Robins led a remarkable life. Her unhappy childhood did not sour her belief in love. Here is her own story.\"[16][17]\\nAt the time of her death in 1985, Robins\\'s books had been translated into fifteen languages and had sold more than one hundred million copies. In 1984, they were borrowed more than one and a half million times from British libraries. Among her best-selling works were House of the Seventh Cross, Khamsin and Dark Corridor.[2] In October 2011 the first dozen of her novels were released in e-book format.[18]\\nSome of her novels have been reedited under different titles or as Denise Robins[17]\\n',\n",

She has written an autobiography entitled Fate Was My Friend[citation needed][when?].\\nHampson dreamed of teaching and writing when she was six, but due to the depression after World War II, she had to leave her studies at fourteen and begin making blouses for Marks & Spencer's. She left work when she married. She sold her sewing machine for £15 to the neighbour who later encouraged her to publish her first novel.[citation needed]\\nLater, when her marriage broke up, she had to return to work and lived in a mobile home in the village of Cuddington in Mid Cheshire. But, when Manchester University decided to trial older women she applied and graduated. She wrote articles about her travels in Greece and they were published in various education magazines. She also had an interest in fossils and sometimes went to the North Yorkshire coast to collect. Her first manuscript was a romance about Delphi where she had visited. This manuscript sat on a shelf in her mobile home until she showed it to Brice Burgum, a neighbour who said she should seek out an agent to get it published.[citation needed]\\nIn 1973, she became a launch author for the new Harlequin Presents line of category romance novels. Harlequin Presents books were more sensual than the previous line, Harlequin Romance, under which she had been published.

As an adult, she taught English on the high school level.  One year she was assigned to teach English for Year 11 students, with a required focus on popular fiction.[1] She intended to use romance novels as an example of popular fiction that focuses on stereotypical characters and plots.[2] After reading several Mills and Boon romances, however, she \"recognised ... that today\\'s romances have the same ingredients I enjoyed in the classic girls book I read when I was young. ... all these stories had spirited heroines and gorgeous guys who were perfect for them\".[2] She enjoyed the short length of the novels and the fact that they focused on women and left hope of a happy ending.[1]\\nFor over four years, Hannay wrote contemporary romance novels and attempted to find a publisher.

Robb, Jill March and (in the U.K.) Sarah Hardesty.\\nRoberts was the first author to be inducted into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame. As of 2011, her novels had spent a combined 861 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, including 176 weeks in the number-one spot.\\nRoberts was born on October 10, 1950, in Silver Spring, Maryland, the youngest of five children.[2] Her parents have Irish ancestry, and she has described herself as \"an Irishwoman through and through\".[3] Her family were avid readers, so books were always important in her life.[4] Although she had always made up stories in her head, Roberts did not write as a child, other than essays for school. She does claim to have \"told lies. Really good ones—some of which my mother still believes.\"[5] She credits the nuns at her Catholic school for instilling in her a sense of discipline.[5]\\nDuring her second year in high school, Roberts transferred to Montgomery Blair High School,[6] where she met her first husband, Ronald Aufdem-Brinke.[7] They married, against her parents\\' wishes, in 1968, as soon as she graduated,[8][9] and settled in Boonsboro. \\nRoberts\\' husband worked at his father\\'s sheet-metal business before joining her parents in their lighting company. She gave birth to two sons, Dan and Jason. Roberts would later refer to this time period as her \"Earth Mother\" years, when she did crafts, including ceramics and sewing her children\\'s clothes.[8] The couple divorced[10] in 1983.\\nRoberts met her second husband, Bruce Wilder, a carpenter, when she hired him to build bookshelves in July 1985.[11][12] Her husband owns Turn the Page Books bookstore in Boonsboro, Maryland,[13] and works as an adult content photographer and videographer.[14]   The couple also owned the nearby historic Boone Hotel. After it was destroyed by a fire in February 2008, it was restored and reopened as the Inn BoonsBoro in 2009; the suites were inspired by and named for literary romantic couples with happy endings.[15]\\nShe is an ardent baseball fan, having been honored by the local minor league baseball team Hagerstown Suns several times.[16]\\nShe began to write during a blizzard in February 1979. Roberts states that with three feet of snow, a dwindling supply of chocolate, and no morning kindergarten for her two boys, she had little else to do.[17][18] She fell in love with the writing process, and quickly produced six manuscripts[19] which she submitted to Harlequin, the leading publisher of romance novels, but was repeatedly rejected. Roberts says,\\nI got the standard rejection for the first couple of tries, then my favorite rejection of all time. I received my manuscript back with a nice little note which said that my work showed promise, and the story had been very entertaining and well done. But that they already had their American writer. That would have been Janet Dailey.[20]Dailey would go on to be embroiled in a plagiarism scandal in which she eventually confessed to stealing some of Roberts\\' work.\\nRoberts once stated: \"You\\'re going to be unemployed if you really think you just have to sit around and wait for the muse to land on your shoulder.\"[21] She concentrates on one novel at a time,[22] writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation.[9] Rather than begin with an outline, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting.[21] She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. Roberts then  goes back to the beginning of the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the \"texture and color\" of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower.[23]\\nShe often writes trilogies, finishing the three books in a row so that she can remain with the same characters.[24] In the past, her trilogies were all released in paperback, as Roberts believed the wait for hardcover editions was too long for the reader.[4] All her new publications are released in hardcover first and e-book, with paperback editions following. \\nRoberts does much of her research over the Internet, as she has an aversion to flying.[9]\\nIn 1980, a new publisher, Silhouette Books, formed to take advantage of the manuscripts from the American writers that Harlequin had rejected.[25] Roberts\\' first novel, Irish Thoroughbred, was published in 1981, using the pseudonym Nora Roberts, a shortened form of her birth name Eleanor Marie Robertson because she assumed that all romance authors had pen names.[8]\\nBetween 1982 and 1984, Roberts wrote 23 novels for Silhouette,[8] published under various Silhouette imprints: Silhouette Sensation, Silhouette Special Edition and Silhouette Desire, as well as Silhouette Intrigue, and MIRA\\'s reissue program. In 1985, Playing the Odds, the first novel in the MacGregor family series, was published and was an immediate bestseller.[8]\\nIn 1987, she began writing single title books for Bantam. Five years later she moved to Putnam to write single title hardcovers and original paperbacks,[26] reaching the hardcover bestseller lists with her fourth hardcover release, 1996\\'s Montana Sky. Roberts has continued to release single-title novels in paperback. She still occasionally writes shorter category romances. Her attachment to the shorter category books stems from her years as a young mother of two boys without much time to read, as she \"[remembers] exactly what it felt like to want to read and not have time to read 200,000 words.\"[9]\\nRoberts was featured in Pamela Regis\\' A Natural History of the Romance Novel. Regis calls Roberts \"a master of the romance novel form\", because she \"has a keen ear for dialogue, constructs deft scenes, maintains a page-turning pace, and provides compelling characterization.\"[20] Publishers Weekly once talked about her \"wry humor and the use of different narrators, two devices that were once rarities\" in the romance novel genre.[9]\\nRoberts had long wanted to write romantic suspense in the vein of Mary Stewart, but, at the urging of her agent, she concentrated on classic contemporary romance while she built a following of readers.[9] After moving to Putnam in 1992, the publishing company quickly realized that they were unable to keep up with Roberts\\'s prolific output. They suggested that she adopt a second pseudonym so they would be able to publish more of her work each year.[24]\\nHer agent, Amy Berkover, convinced the publishers to allow Roberts to write romantic suspense under the new name.[9]  She chose the pseudonym D. J. MacGregor, but right before publication, discovered it was in use by another author.[17]  Instead, her first romantic suspense novel was published in 1995 under the pseudonym J. D. Robb. The initials \"J. D.\" were taken from her sons, Jason and Dan, while \"Robb\" is a shortened form of Roberts.\\nAs J. D. Robb, Roberts has published a series of futuristic science fiction police procedurals. These books, all part of the in Death series, feature detective Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke and are set in a mid-21st century New York City. Despite the emphasis on solving a crime in each of the books, the overall theme of the series is the development of the relationship between Eve and Roarke.[24] When the in Death series began, neither Roberts nor her publisher acknowledged that she was the author. They hoped to allow the series to stand on its own merits and build its own following.[27]\\nAfter publishing 18 novels in the in Death series, Putnam published the nineteenth, Divided in Death, first in hardcover. The book became Roberts\\' first bestselling novel of 2004.[28]\\nAs of March 2022, Roberts has published 54 novels plus ten novellas in the in Death series.[29]\\nRoberts wrote a story for a magazine titled Melodies of Love under the pseudonym Jill March.[17] She has also been known as Sarah Hardesty in the UK. When the Born In series was released in Britain it carried that name instead of Nora Roberts. She has since changed publishers.[17]\\nIn 1996, Roberts passed the hundred-novel mark with Montana Sky and, in 2012, doubled that with The Witness. In both 1999 and 2000, four of the five novels that USA Today listed as the best-selling romance novels of the year were written by Roberts. Her first appearance on The New York Times Best Seller list came in 1991,[22] and between 1991 and 2001, she had 68 New York Times Bestsellers, counting hardbacks and paperbacks. [30] In 2001, Roberts had 10 best-selling mass-market paperbacks, according to Publishers Weekly, not counting those books written under the J.D. Robb name. In September 2001, for the first time Roberts took the numbers 1 and 2 spots on the Publishers Weekly bestseller list, as her romance Time and Again was number one, and her J.D. Robb release Seduction in Death was number two.[31]\\nSince 1999, every one of Roberts\\'s novels has been a New York Times bestseller, and 124 of her novels have ranked on the Times bestseller list, including 29 that debuted in the number-one spot. As of January 24, 2013, Roberts\\'s novels had spent a combined 948 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, including 148 weeks in the number-one spot. As of January 9, 2009, 400\\xa0million copies of her books are in print, including 12\\xa0million copies sold in 2005 alone. Her novels have been published in 35 countries.[32]\\nA founding member of the Romance Writers of America (RWA), Roberts was the first inductee in the organization\\'s Hall of Fame.[9] In 1997 she was awarded the RWA Lifetime Achievement Award, which in 2008 was renamed the RWA Nora Roberts Lifetime Achievement Award.[33] As of 2012, she has won an unprecedented 21 of the RWA\\'s RITA Awards, the highest honor given in the romance genre.[34]\\nTwo of Roberts\\' novels, Sanctuary and Magic Moments, had previously been made into TV movies. In 2007, Lifetime Television adapted four Nora Roberts novels into TV movies: Angels Fall starring Heather Locklear, Montana Sky starring Ashley Williams, Blue Smoke starring Alicia Witt, and Carolina Moon starring Claire Forlani. This was the first time that Lifetime had adapted multiple works by the same author.[35] Four more films were released on four consecutive Saturdays in March and April 2009. The 2009 collection included Northern Lights starring LeAnn Rimes and Eddie Cibrian, Midnight Bayou starring Jerry O\\'Connell, High Noon starring Emilie de Ravin, and Tribute starring Brittany Murphy.\\nTIME named Roberts one of their 100 Most Influential People in 2007, saying she \"has inspected, dissected, deconstructed, explored, explained and extolled the passions of the human heart.\"[36] Roberts was one of only two authors on the list, the other being David Mitchell.[36]\\nIn 1997, another best-selling romance writer, Janet Dailey, admitted to repeatedly plagiarizing Roberts\\' work. The practice came to light after a reader read Roberts\\' Sweet Revenge and Dailey\\'s Notorious back-to-back; she noticed several similarities and posted the comparable passages on the Internet. Calling the plagiarism \"mind-boggling\", Roberts sued Dailey.[9] Dailey acknowledged the plagiarism and attributed it to a psychological disorder. She admitted that both Aspen Gold and Notorious lifted heavily from Roberts\\' work. Both of those novels were pulled from print after Dailey\\'s admission.[37][38] In April 1998, Dailey settled the case. Roberts donated the settlement to various literary causes including the Literacy Volunteers of America (now ProLiteracy).[9][39][40][41]\\nRoberts joined the chorus strongly criticizing fellow romance writer Cassie Edwards, who had lifted many passages from much older sources (many in the public domain) without giving credit, forcing Edwards out of the business.[42][43]\\nIn 2019 Roberts, along with other authors, was a victim of plagiarism by Cristiane Serruya.[44][45][46]\\nRoberts has been included repeatedly on the Giving Back Fund\\'s annual lists of the most philanthropic celebrities, with the bulk of her donations going to the Nora Roberts Foundation.[47][48][49] The foundation financially supports organizations that promote literacy and the arts, assist children and engage in humanitarian efforts.

During the course of her career, she wrote for a variety of different international publishers including: Penguin, Collins, Fontana, Hodder & Stoughton, Hodder Headline and Simon & Schuster.\\nKnown for her swiftness, literary style and versatility, Sheila Holland was able to write in several different genres – hence her plethora of pseudonyms as well as publishers.

One of the first writers to explore the boundaries of sexual desire, her novels often reflected the forefront of the \"sexual revolution\" of the 1970s. Her books touched on then-taboo subjects such as child abuse and rape, and she created sexually confident -even dominant- heroines. She was also one of the first to create a modern romantic heroine: independent, imperfect, and perfectly capable of initiating a sexual or romantic relationship.[3]\\nHer last novel, a romantic thriller published posthumously with Hodder & Stoughton, was entitled The Angel of Death.\\n(Same titles as Sheila Holland)\\n',\n",

Her mother was an artist and writer.[4] Her father was away for war service in India when she was born; he returned when she was three. The family settled in Reigate, Surrey. Trollope has a younger brother and sister. She was educated at Reigate County School for Girls,[5] gaining scholarship to St Hugh\\'s College, Oxford in 1961. She read English.[6]\\nHer father was of the same family as the Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope; she is his fifth-generation niece,[7] and is a cousin of the writer and broadcaster James Trollope. Of inheriting the name, she has said:\\n\"Oddly my name has been no professional help at all! It seems to have made no difference... I admire him hugely, both for his benevolence and his enormous psychological perception\".[8]From 1965 to 1967, she worked at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. While a civil servant, she researched Eastern Europe and the relations between China and the developing world.[9] From 1967 to 1979, she was employed in a number of teaching posts before she became a writer full-time in 1980.\\nTrollope began writing historical romances under the pseudonym of Caroline Harvey, the first names of her father\\'s parents. She formed the view that: \"It was the wrong genre for the time.\"[4] Encouraged by her second husband, Ian Curteis, she switched to the contemporary fiction for which she has become known.[10] The Choir, published in 1987, was her first contemporary novel.[7] The Rector\\'s Wife, published in 1991, displaced Jeffrey Archer from the top of the hardback bestseller lists. As an explanation, she said in 2006: \"except for thrillers there was nothing in the middle ground of the traditional novel, which is where I think I am.\"[4] In 1992, only Jilly Cooper\\'s Polo and Archer\\'s As the Crow Flies were stronger paperback bestsellers. \"I think my books are just the dear old traditional novel making a quiet comeback\", she told Geraldine Bedell in a 1993 interview for The Independent on Sunday.[5]\\n\\nOften described as Aga sagas, for their rural themes, only two of Trollope\\'s novels (by 2006) actually feature an Aga.[4] The term\\'s entry in The Oxford Companion to English Literature (2009) states that \"by no means all her work fits the generally comforting implications of the label\".[11] Rejecting the label as not being accurate, Trollope told Lisa Allardice, writing for The Guardian in 2006: \"Actually, the novels are quite subversive, quite bleak. It\\'s all rather patronising isn\\'t it?\"[4] Allardice disputed the \"cosy reputation\" Trollope\\'s books had acquired as her novels had \"tackled increasingly thorny issues including lesbianism, broken families and adoption, the mood growing darker with each novel.\"[4] Terence Blacker, who coined the term for Trollope\\'s fiction in Publishing News in 1992,[11] admitted a decade later that he \"felt terribly guilty\" for lumbering Trollope with the phrase.[12][13] Trollope told Bedell in 1993 that her fiction does \"the things the traditional novel has always done\" by mirroring reality and exploring \"people\\'s emotional lives\". Bedell observed that her novels until then were: \"never suburban, which is the real condition of most of England. Trollopian action takes place in large village houses, at vast kitchen tables; her doctors, vicars, solicitors and craft-gallery owners may worry about money, as her own parents did, but they don\\'t have any social anxieties: they are invited for drinks at the big house as a matter of course. The books are as economically prestigious, and quite as aspirational in their own way, as the glitter blockbusters of the Eighties.\"[5]In 2009, she donated the short story The Piano Man to Oxfam\\'s \\'Ox-Tales\\' project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors.

       " 'Ann Herendeen is an American author of popular fiction. Herendeen\\'s novels are notable[1] for their queering of the traditional romance novel.\\nA native New Yorker and lifelong Brooklyn resident, Herendeen graduated with high honors in English from Princeton University. She also holds a Master of Library Science degree from Pratt Institute.\\nHerendeen\\'s first novel Phyllida and the Brotherhood of Philander, was initially issued by a subsidy publisher with the subtitle A Bisexual Regency Romance, in 2005. Harper Collins released a slightly altered version of the book in 2008 without that subtitle. Herendeen\\'s atypical Regency Romance introduces a central same-sex love story into a Regency-set tale of a marriage of convenience which otherwise obeys many of the conventions of genre romance. The heroine Phyllida, an author, offers the hero a quid pro quo of \"irregular\" liberty in marriage - his sexual freedom for her literary and professional freedom. The novel delivers the generically required account of the development of the couple\\'s erotic and tender bonds through trials to deep and permanent commitment, while Phyllida\\'s authorship supplies Herendeen\\'s text with a common metafictional feature of postmodern genre romance: a novel-within-the-novel, exploring forbidden sexuality in the fashionable manner of the era. Passages of Phyllida\\'s fiction are rendered as pastiches of the great Gothic tradition (e.g. Charles Maturin, Ann Radcliffe, Matthew \"Monk\" Lewis, Clara Reeve, Mary Shelley) the language and conventions of which are at once mocked and relished.\\nAccording to Herendeen:\\n [Phyllida and the Brotherhood of Philander] took a traditional Georgette Heyer form of the Regency romance —- a witty, drawing-room comedy of manners -- sexed it up, and queered it by making the hero “slightly bisexual” .... The idea was to use all the clichés or standard tropes of these m/f [male & female] romances -— the alpha male rakish hero, the marriage of convenience, and the Bertie Wooster-ish group of the hero’s friends —- to tell an m/m/f romance, giving the hero a hea [happily ever after] with his wife and his boyfriend.[2]McDaniel College\\'s Pamela Regis,[3] author of A Natural History of the Romance Novel, brings forward Phyllida and the Brotherhood of Philander as evidence against what she contends is the myth of the genre\\'s fundamentally socially reactionary nature.[4]  In her article in the new edition of The Cambridge History of the American Novel, Regis argues:\\n In [Phyllida and the Brotherhood of Philander], sentimental values domesticate sexual practices and family structures that were (and still are in some cases) against the law. Novels like Phyllida show that the romance novel, once derided for its heteronormative ideology, is proving more inclusive than society at large. \\n(\"Female Genre Fiction in the 20th Century,\" in The Cambridge History of the American Novel, 2011 p. 857)Herendeen\\'s second novel Pride/Prejudice is a slash fiction contribution to the immense catalogue[5] of mash-ups, sequels, fan fiction, retellings, updatings, spin-offs and homages to Jane Austen\\'s celebrated novel. Pride/Prejudice narrates Austen\\'s original story unearthing the \"forbidden\" intimacies between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley and between Elizabeth Bennet and Charlotte Lucas. Salon\\'s reviewer Laura Miller noted that Herendeen\\'s language in Pride/Prejudice is the most successful of the Austen derivatives in \"approximating Austen\\'s style without aping it.\"[6]\\nThe novel was 2010 Lambda Literary Award finalist in the category \"bisexual fiction\" category.[7]\\nHerendeen is the author of a series of \"sword-and-sorcery\" fantasy novels.

       " '\\nGeorgette Heyer (/ˈheɪ.ər/; 16 August 1902\\xa0– 4 July 1974) was an English novelist and short-story writer, in both the Regency romance and detective fiction genres. Her writing career began in 1921, when she turned a story conceived for her ailing younger brother into the novel The Black Moth. In 1925 Heyer married George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer. The couple spent several years living in Tanganyika Territory and Macedonia before returning to England in 1929. After her novel These Old Shades became popular despite its release during the General Strike, Heyer determined that publicity was not necessary for good sales. For the rest of her life she refused to grant interviews, telling a friend: \"My private life concerns no one but myself and my family.\"[2]\\nHeyer essentially established the historical romance genre and its subgenre Regency romance. Her Regencies were inspired by Jane Austen. To ensure accuracy, Heyer collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. Whilst some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the level of detail to be Heyer\\'s greatest asset. Her meticulous nature was also evident in her historical novels; Heyer even recreated William the Conqueror\\'s crossing into England for her novel The Conqueror.\\nBeginning in 1932 Heyer released one romance novel and one thriller each year. (See List of works by Georgette Heyer.) Her husband often provided basic outlines for the plots of her thrillers, leaving Heyer to develop character relationships and dialogue so as to bring the story to life. Although many critics describe Heyer\\'s detective novels as unoriginal, others such as Nancy Wingate praise them \"for their wit and comedy as well as for their well-woven plots\".[3]\\nHer success was sometimes clouded by problems with tax inspectors and alleged plagiarists. Heyer chose not to file lawsuits against the suspected literary thieves but tried multiple ways of minimizing her tax liability. Forced to put aside the works she called her \"magnum opus\" (a trilogy covering the House of Lancaster) to write more commercially successful works, Heyer eventually created a limited liability company to administer the rights to her novels. She was accused several times of providing an overly large salary for herself, and in 1966 she sold the company and the rights to seventeen of her novels to Booker-McConnell. Heyer continued writing until her death in July 1974. At that time 48 of her novels were still in print; her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously.\\nGeorgette Heyer was born in Wimbledon, London, in 1902. She was named after her father, George Heyer.[4] Her mother, Sylvia Watkins, studied both cello and piano and was one of the top three students in her class at the Royal College of Music. Heyer\\'s paternal grandfather had emigrated from Russia, whilst her maternal grandparents owned tugboats on the River Thames.[5]\\nHeyer was the eldest of three children; her brothers, George Boris (known as Boris) and Frank, were four and nine years younger than she.[4] For part of her childhood the family lived in Paris but they returned to England shortly after World War I broke out in 1914.[6] Although the family\\'s surname had been pronounced \"higher\", the advent of war led her father to switch to the pronunciation \"hair\" so they would not be mistaken for Germans.[7] During the war her father served as a requisitions officer for the British Army in France. After the war he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE).[8] He left the army in 1920 with the rank of captain,[9] taught at King\\'s College London and sometimes wrote for The Granta.[4][5]\\nGeorge Heyer strongly encouraged his children to read and never forbade any book. Georgette read widely and often met her friends Joanna Cannan and Carola Oman to discuss books.[10] Heyer and Oman later shared their works-in-progress with each other and offered criticism.[11]\\nWhen she was 17 Heyer began a serial story to amuse her brother Boris, who suffered from a form of haemophilia and was often weak. Her father enjoyed listening to her story and asked her to prepare it for publication. His agent found a publisher for her book, and The Black Moth, about the adventures of a young man who took responsibility for his brother\\'s card-cheating, was issued in 1921.[10][12] According to her biographer, Jane Aiken Hodge, the novel contained many of the elements that would become standard for Heyer\\'s novels, the \"saturnine male lead, the marriage in danger, the extravagant wife, and the group of idle, entertaining young men\".[13] The following year one of her contemporary short stories, \"A Proposal to Cicely\", was published in Happy Magazine.[14]\\nWhile holidaying with her family in December 1920 Heyer met George Ronald Rougier, who was two years her senior.[15] The two became regular dance partners while Rougier was studying at the Royal School of Mines to become a mining engineer. In the spring of 1925, shortly after the publication of her fifth novel, they became engaged. One month later Heyer\\'s father died of a heart attack. He left no pension and Heyer assumed financial responsibility for her brothers, aged 19 and 14.[16] Two months after her father\\'s death, on 18 August, Heyer and Rougier married in a simple ceremony.[17]\\nIn October 1925 Rougier was sent to work in the Caucasus Mountains, partly because he had learned Russian as a child.[18][19] Heyer remained at home and continued to write.[18] In 1926 she released These Old Shades, in which the Duke of Avon courts his own ward. Unlike her first novel, These Old Shades focused more on personal relationships than on adventure.[12] The book appeared in the midst of the 1926 United Kingdom general strike; as a result the novel received no newspaper coverage, reviews or advertising. Nevertheless the book sold 190,000\\xa0copies.[20] Because the lack of publicity had not harmed the novel\\'s sales, Heyer refused for the rest of her life to promote her books, even though her publishers often asked her to give interviews.[21] She once wrote to a friend that \"as for being photographed at Work or in my Old World Garden, that is the type of publicity which I find nauseating and quite unnecessary. My private life concerns no one but myself and my family.\"[2]\\nRougier returned home in the summer of 1926, but within months he was sent to the East African territory of Tanganyika. Heyer joined him there the following year.[22] They lived in a hut made of elephant grass in the bush;[11] Heyer was the first white woman her servants had ever seen.[22] While in Tanganyika Heyer wrote The Masqueraders; set in 1745, the book follows the romantic adventures of siblings who pretend to be of the opposite sex in order to protect their family, all former Jacobites. Although Heyer did not have access to all of her reference material, the book contained only one\\xa0anachronism: she placed the opening of White\\'s a year too early.[11] She also wrote an account of her adventures, entitled \"The Horned Beast of Africa\", which was published in 1929 in the newspaper The Sphere.[23]\\nIn 1928 Heyer followed her husband to Macedonia, where she almost died after a dentist improperly administered an anaesthetic.[22] She insisted they return to England before starting a family. The following year Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner.[22][24] After a failed experiment running a gas, coke and lighting company Rougier purchased a sports shop in Horsham with money they borrowed from Heyer\\'s aunts. Heyer\\'s brother Boris lived above the shop and helped Rougier, while Heyer continued to provide the bulk of the family\\'s earnings with her writing.[22]\\nHeyer\\'s earliest works were romance novels, most set before 1800.[25] In 1935 she released Regency Buck, her first novel set in the Regency period. This bestselling novel essentially established the genre of Regency romance.[26] Unlike romantic fiction of the period by other writers, Heyer\\'s novels featured the setting as a plot device. Many of her characters exhibited modern-day sensibilities; more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine\\'s eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love.[27] The books were set almost entirely in the world of the wealthy upper class[28] and only occasionally mention poverty, religion or politics.[29]\\nAlthough the British Regency lasted only from 1811 to 1820, Heyer\\'s romances were set between 1752 and 1825. According to the literary critic Kay Mussell, the books revolved around a \"structured social ritual – the marriage market represented by the London season\" where \"all are in danger of ostracism for inappropriate behavior\".[30] Her Regency romances were inspired by the writings of Jane Austen, whose novels were set in the same era. Austen\\'s works, however, were contemporary novels, describing the times in which she lived. According to Pamela Regis in her work A Natural History of the Romance Novel, because Heyer\\'s stories took place amidst events that had occurred more than 100\\xa0years earlier, she had to include more detail on the period in order for her readers to understand it.[31] Whilst Austen could ignore the \"minutiae of dress and decor\",[32] Heyer included those details \"to invest the novels\\xa0... with \\'the tone of the time\\'\".[33] Later reviewers, such as Lillian Robinson, criticized Heyer\\'s \"passion for the specific fact without concern for its significance\",[34] and Marghanita Laski wrote that \"these aspects on which Heyer is so dependent for her creation of atmosphere are just those which Jane Austen\\xa0... referred to only when she wanted to show that a character was vulgar or ridiculous\".[35] Others, including A.S. Byatt, believe that Heyer\\'s \"awareness of this atmosphere – both of the minute details of the social pursuits of her leisured classes and of the emotional structure behind the fiction it produced – is her greatest asset\".[36]\\nDetermined to make her novels as accurate as possible, Heyer collected reference works and research materials to use while writing.[37] At the time of her death she owned more than 1,000\\xa0historical reference books, including Debrett\\'s and an 1808 dictionary of the House of Lords. In addition to the standard historical works about the medieval and eighteenth-century periods, her library included histories of snuff boxes, sign posts and costumes.[38] She often clipped illustrations from magazine articles and jotted down interesting vocabulary or facts onto note cards but rarely recorded where she found the information.[39] Her notes were sorted into categories, such as Beauty, Colours, Dress, Hats, Household, Prices and Shops, and even included details such as the cost of candles in a particular year.[38][40] Other notebooks contained lists of phrases, covering such topics as \"Food and Crockery\", \"Endearments\", and \"Forms of Address.\"[40] One of her publishers, Max Reinhardt, once attempted to offer editorial suggestions about the language in one of her books but was promptly informed by a member of his staff that no one in England knew more about Regency language than Heyer.[41]\\nIn the interests of accuracy Heyer once purchased a letter written by the Duke of Wellington so that she could precisely employ his style of writing.[42] She claimed that every word attributed to Wellington in An Infamous Army was actually spoken or written by him in real life.[43] Her knowledge of the period was so extensive that Heyer rarely mentioned dates explicitly in her books; instead, she situated the story by casually referring to major and minor events of the time.[44]\\nHeyer specialised in two types of romantic male lead, which she called Mark I and Mark II. Mark I, with overtones of Mr Rochester, was (in her words) \"rude, overbearing, and often a bounder\".[45] Mark II by contrast was debonair, sophisticated and often a style-icon.[46] Similarly, her heroines (reflecting Austen\\'s division between lively and gentle)[47] fell into two broad groups: the tall and dashing, mannish type,[48] and the quiet bullied type.[49]\\nWhen a Mark I hero meets a Mark I heroine, as in Bath Tangle or Faro\\'s Daughter, high drama ensues, whilst an interesting twist on the underlying paradigm is provided by The Grand Sophy, where the Mark I hero considers himself a Mark II and has to be challenged for his true nature to emerge.[50]\\nThe Conqueror (1931) was Heyer\\'s first novel of historical fiction to give a fictionalized account of real historical events. She researched the life of William the Conqueror thoroughly, even travelling the route that William took when crossing into England.[51] The following year, Heyer\\'s writing took an even more drastic departure from her early historical romances when her first thriller, Footsteps in the Dark was published. The novel\\'s appearance coincided with the birth of her only child, Richard George Rougier, whom she called her \"most notable (indeed peerless) work\".[52] Later in her life, Heyer requested that her publishers refrain from reprinting Footsteps in the Dark, saying \"This work, published simultaneously with my son\\xa0... was the first of my thrillers and was perpetuated while I was, as any Regency character would have said, increasing. One husband and two ribald brothers all had fingers in it, and I do not claim it as a Major Work.\"[53]\\nFor the next several years Heyer published one romance novel and one thriller each year. The romances were far more popular: they usually sold 115,000\\xa0copies, while her thrillers sold 16,000\\xa0copies.[54] According to her son, Heyer \"regarded the writing of mystery stories rather as we would regard tackling a crossword puzzle – an intellectual diversion before the harder tasks of life have to be faced\".[25] Heyer\\'s husband was involved in much of her writing. He often read the proofs of her historical romances to catch any errors that she might have missed, and served as a collaborator for her thrillers. He provided the plots of the detective stories, describing the actions of characters \"A\" and \"B\".[55] Heyer would then create the characters and the relationships between them and bring the plot points to life. She found it difficult at times to rely on someone else\\'s plots; on at least one occasion, before writing the last chapter of a book, she asked Rougier to explain once again how the murder was really committed.[55]\\nHer detective stories, which, according to critic Earl F. Bargainnier, \"specialize[d] in upper-class family murders\", were known primarily for their comedy, melodrama, and romance.[56] The comedy derived not from the action but from the personalities and dialogue of the characters.[57] In most of these novels, all set in the time they were written,[58] the focus relied primarily on the hero, with a lesser role for the heroine.[59] Her early mystery novels often featured athletic heroes; once Heyer\\'s husband began pursuing his lifelong dream of becoming a barrister, the novels began to feature solicitors and barristers in lead roles.[60]\\nIn 1935, Heyer\\'s thrillers began following a pair of detectives named Superintendent Hannasyde and Sergeant (later Inspector) Hemingway. The two were never as popular as other contemporary fictional detectives such as Agatha Christie\\'s Hercule Poirot and Dorothy L. Sayers\\'s Lord Peter Wimsey.[61] One of the books featuring Heyer\\'s characters, Death in the Stocks, was dramatized in New York City in 1937 as Merely Murder. The play focused on the comedy rather than the mystery,[62] and although it had a good cast, including Edward Fielding as Hannasyde, it closed after three nights.[37][63]\\nAccording to critic Nancy Wingate, Heyer\\'s detective novels, the last written in 1953,[64] often featured unoriginal methods, motives, and characters, with seven of them using inheritance as the motive.[3] The novels were always set in London, a small village, or at a houseparty.[65] Critic Erik Routley labelled many of her characters clichés, including the uneducated policeman, an exotic Spanish dancer, and a country vicar with a neurotic wife. In one of her novels, the characters\\' surnames were even in alphabetical order according to the order they were introduced.[66] According to Wingate, Heyer\\'s detective stories, like many of the others of the time, exhibited a distinct snobbery towards foreigners and the lower classes.[67] Her middle-class men were often crude and stupid, while the women were either incredibly practical or exhibited poor judgement, usually using poor grammar that could become vicious.[68] Despite the stereotypes, however, Routley maintains that Heyer had \"a quite remarkable gift for reproducing the brittle and ironic conversation of the upper middle class Englishwoman of that age (immediately before 1940)\".[66] Wingate further mentions that Heyer\\'s thrillers were known \"for their wit and comedy as well as for their well-woven plots\".[3]\\nIn 1939, Rougier was called to the Bar, and the family moved first to Brighton, then to Hove, so that Rougier could easily commute to London. The following year, they sent their son to a preparatory school, creating an additional expense for Heyer. The Blitz bombing of 1940–41 disrupted train travel in Britain, prompting Heyer and her family to move to London in 1942 so that Rougier would be closer to his work.[69]\\nAfter having lunch with a representative from Hodder & Stoughton, who published her detective stories, Heyer felt that her host had patronized her. The company had an option on her next book; to make them break her contract,[70] she wrote Penhallow, which the 1944 Book Review Digest described as \"a murder story but not a mystery story\".[71] Hodder & Stoughton turned the book down, thus ending their association with Heyer, and Heinemann agreed to publish it instead. Her publisher in the United States, Doubleday, also disliked the book and ended their relationship with Heyer after its publication.[70]\\nDuring World War II, her brothers served in the armed forces, alleviating one of her monetary worries. Her husband, meanwhile, served in the Home Guard, besides continuing as a barrister.[72] As he was new to his career, Rougier did not earn much money, and paper rationing during the war caused lower sales of Heyer\\'s books. To meet their expenses Heyer sold the Commonwealth rights for These Old Shades, Devil\\'s Cub, and Regency Buck to her publisher, Heinemann, for £750. A contact at the publishing house, her close friend A.S. Frere, later offered to return the rights to her for the same amount of money she was paid. Heyer refused to accept the deal, explaining that she had given her word to transfer the rights.[73] Heyer also reviewed books for Heinemann, earning 2\\xa0guineas for each review,[74] and she allowed her novels to be serialized in Women\\'s Journal prior to their publication as hardcover books. The appearance of a Heyer novel usually caused the magazine to sell out completely, but she complained that they \"always like[d] my worst work\".[21]\\nTo minimize her tax liability, Heyer formed a limited liability company called Heron Enterprises around 1950. Royalties from new titles would be paid to the company, which would then furnish Heyer\\'s salary and pay directors\\' fees to her family. She would continue to receive royalties from her previous titles, and foreign royalties – except for those from the United States – would go to her mother.[75] Within several years, however, a tax inspector found that Heyer was withdrawing too much money from the company. The inspector considered the extra funds as undisclosed dividends, meaning that she owed an additional £3,000 in taxes. To pay the tax bill, Heyer wrote two articles, \"Books about the Brontës\" and \"How to be a Literary Writer\", that were published in the magazine Punch.[23][76] She once wrote to a friend, \"I\\'m getting so tired of writing books for the benefit of the Treasury and I can\\'t tell you how utterly I resent the squandering of my money on such fatuous things as Education and Making Life Easy and Luxurious for So-Called Workers.\"[77]\\nIn 1950, Heyer began working on what she called \"the magnum opus of my latter years\", a medieval trilogy intended to cover the House of Lancaster between 1393 and 1435.[78] She estimated that she would need five years to complete the works. Her impatient readers continually clamored for new books; to satisfy them and her tax liabilities, Heyer interrupted herself to write Regency romances. The manuscript of volume one of the series, My Lord John, was published posthumously.[78]\\nThe limited liability company continued to vex Heyer, and in 1966, after tax inspectors found that she owed the company £20,000, she finally fired her accountants. She then asked that the rights to her newest book, Black Sheep, be issued to her personally.[79] Unlike her other novels, Black Sheep did not focus on members of the aristocracy. Instead, it followed \"the moneyed middle class\", with finance a dominant theme in the novel.[80]\\nHeyer\\'s new accountants urged her to abandon Heron Enterprises; after two\\xa0years, she finally agreed to sell the company to Booker-McConnell, which already owned the rights to the estates of novelists Ian Fleming and Agatha Christie. Booker-McConnell paid her approximately £85,000 for the rights to the 17 Heyer titles owned by the company. This amount was taxed at the lower capital transfer rate, rather than the higher income tax rate.[81]\\nAs Heyer\\'s popularity increased, other authors began to imitate her style. In May 1950, one of her readers notified her that Barbara Cartland had written several novels in a style similar to Heyer\\'s, reusing names, character traits and plot points and paraphrased descriptions from her books, particularly A Hazard of Hearts, which borrowed characters from Friday\\'s Child, and The Knave of Hearts which took off These Old Shades. Heyer completed a detailed analysis of the alleged plagiarisms for her solicitors, and while the case never came to court and no apology was received, the copying ceased.[82] Her lawyers suggested that she leak the copying to the press. Heyer refused.[83]\\nIn 1961, another reader wrote of similarities found in the works of Kathleen Lindsay, particularly the novel Winsome Lass.[84] The novels borrowed plot points, characters, surnames, and plentiful Regency slang. After fans accused Heyer of \"publishing shoddy stuff under a pseudonym\", Heyer wrote to the other publisher to complain.[85] When the author took exception to the accusations, Heyer made a thorough list of the borrowings and historical mistakes in the books. Among these were repeated use of the phrase \"to make a cake of oneself\", which Heyer had discovered in a privately printed memoir unavailable to the public. In another case, the author referenced a historical incident that Heyer had invented in an earlier novel.[85] Heyer\\'s lawyers recommended an injunction, but she ultimately decided not to sue.[84]\\nIn 1959, Rougier became a Queen\\'s Counsel.[86] The following year, their son Richard fell in love with the estranged wife of an acquaintance. Richard assisted the woman, Susanna Flint, in leaving her husband, and the couple married after her divorce was finalized. Heyer was shocked at the impropriety but soon came to love her daughter-in-law, later describing her as \"the daughter we never had and thought we didn\\'t want\".[87] Richard and his wife raised her two sons from her first marriage and provided Heyer with her only biological grandchild in 1966, when their son Nicholas Rougier was born.[79]\\nAs Heyer aged she began to suffer more frequent health problems. In June 1964, she underwent surgery to remove a kidney stone. Although the doctors initially predicted a six-week recovery, after two months they predicted that it might be a year or longer before she felt completely well. The following year, she suffered a mosquito bite that turned septic, prompting the doctors to offer skin grafts.[88] In July 1973 she suffered a slight stroke and spent three weeks in a nursing home. When her brother Boris died later that year, Heyer was too ill to travel to his funeral. She suffered another stroke in February 1974. Three months later, she was diagnosed with lung cancer, which her biographer attributed to the 60–80 cork-tipped cigarettes that Heyer smoked each day (although she said she did not inhale). On 4 July 1974, Heyer died. Her fans learned her married name for the first time from her obituaries.[89]\\nBesides her success in the United Kingdom, Heyer\\'s novels were very popular in the United States and Germany and achieved respectable sales in Czechoslovakia.[90] A first printing of one of her novels in the Commonwealth often consisted of 65,000–75,000 copies,[91] and her novels collectively sold over 100,000\\xa0copies in hardback each year.[90] Her paperbacks usually sold over 500,000\\xa0copies each.[92] At the time of her death 48 of her books were still in print, including her first novel, The Black Moth.[93]\\nHer books were very popular during the Great Depression and World War II. Her novels, which journalist Lesley McDowell described as containing \"derring-do, dashing blades, and maids in peril\", allowed readers to escape from the mundane and difficult elements of their lives.[26] In a letter describing her novel Friday\\'s Child, Heyer commented, \"\\'I think myself I ought to be shot for writing such nonsense. ... But it\\'s unquestionably good escapist literature and I think I should rather like it if I were sitting in an air-raid shelter or recovering from flu.\"[26]\\nHeyer essentially invented the historical romance[94] and created the subgenre of the Regency romance.[31] When first released as mass market paperbacks in the United States in 1966, her novels were described as being \"in the tradition of Jane Austen\".[32] As other novelists began to imitate her style and continue to develop the Regency romance, their novels have been described as \"following in the romantic tradition of Georgette Heyer\".[32] According to Kay Mussell, \"virtually every Regency writer covets [that] accolade\".[95]\\nHeyer has been criticised for antisemitism, in particular a scene in The Grand Sophy (published in 1950).[96][97][98] Courtney Milan has said that \"Georgette Heyer was a racist, and so her depiction of the era was deeply imperfect\".[98] Examination of family papers by Jennifer Kloester confirms she held prejudiced personal opinions.[99]\\nDespite her popularity and success, Heyer was largely ignored by critics other than Dorothy L. Sayers, who reviewed An Unfinished Clue and Death in the Stocks for The Sunday Times. Although none of her novels was ever reviewed in a serious newspaper,[92] according to Duff Hart-Davis, \"the absence of long or serious reviews never worried her. What mattered was the fact that her stories sold in ever-increasing numbers\".[93] Heyer was also overlooked by the Encyclopædia Britannica. The 1974 edition of the encyclopædia, published shortly after her death, included entries on popular writers Agatha Christie and Sayers, but did not mention Heyer.[100]\\n',\n",

A keen reader from childhood, her mother would leave her in the children's section of the local library while she changed her father's library books.[3] Her story-telling career began at the age of eight when she began telling original bedtime stories to her younger sister. Her favourite books were those of Jane Austen, Dorothy Dunnett, Catherine Cookson, Georgette Heyer, Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare's plays and poetry and the Bible.[4][5] After reading a serialised Mills & Boon book in a woman's magazine, she fell in love with the hero. Jones was eleven and she quickly became an avid fan. Jones left grammar school in Rochdale with O-Levels in English Language, English Literature and Geography.[1] In her early days, she spent fourteen years working as a shorthand typist in Manchester.[6][7]\\nJones married Steve Halsall, an accountant, who died of cancer,[8][9] predeceasing her.

He bought her, at a time when he could ill afford it, the small electric typewriter on which she typed her first books. She entered a competition run by the Romantic Novelists' Association. Although she did not win, an agent looking for a new-style Georgette Heyer, contacted the R.N.A.[1]\\nIn March 1979, she published her first novel under the pseudonym Caroline Courtney, Duchess in Disguise, the same year she published other 4 books.

       " 'Grace Livingston Hill (April 16, 1865 – February 23, 1947) was an early 20th-century novelist and wrote both under her real name and the pseudonym Marcia Macdonald. She wrote over 100 novels and numerous short stories.  Her characters were most often young Christian women or become Christians within the confines of the story.\\nGrace Livingston Hill was born in Wellsville, New York to Marcia Macdonald Livingston and her husband, Presbyterian minister, Rev. Charles Montgomery Livingston. Both were writers, as was her aunt, Isabella Macdonald Alden, who wrote under the pseudonym \"Pansy.\"\\nHill\\'s writing career began as a child in the 1870s, writing short stories for her aunt\\'s weekly children\\'s publication, The Pansy. Her first story printed in book form was The Esselstynes, which was published in 1877 as part of the \"Mother\\'s Boys and Girls Library\" by D. Lothrop & Company.\\nA Chautauqua Idyl, her first book as a young adult, was written in 1887 to earn enough money for a family trip from her Florida home to the summer Chautauqua gathering at Chautauqua, New York. This illustrated allegory of a Chautauqua gathering held by the flowers, tree, and animals was published in time to be offered for sale that summer and brought enough earnings to take the family there. Several books written in collaboration with her family followed in the early 1890s, as well as her only children\\'s book, A Little Servant.\\nLack of funds was a frequent motivator, particularly after the death of her first husband left her with two small children and no income other than that from her writing.  After the death of Hill\\'s father less than a year later, her mother came to live with her.  This prompted Hill to write more frequently.  During and after her failed ten-year marriage to second husband Flavius Josephus Lutz, a church organist 15 years her junior, she continued to write to support her children and mother. She stopped using the Lutz surname after they parted ways in May 1914.\\nAlthough many of her earlier novels were specifically intended to proselytize, Hill\\'s publishers frequently removed overt references to religious themes.  After her publishers realized the popularity of her books, references to religious topics were allowed to remain, although she later modified her writing style to appeal to a more secular audience.  The last Grace Livingston Hill book, Mary Arden, was finished by her daughter, Ruth Hill Munce, writing under the name of Ruth Livingston Hill, and published in 1948.\\nHill\\'s messages are simple in nature: good versus evil. As Hill believed the Bible was very clear about what was good and evil in life, she reflected that design in her own works.  She wrote about a variety of different subjects, almost always with a romance worked into the message and often essential to the return to grace on the part of one or several characters.\\nIf her clear-cut descriptions of evil in man and woman were Hill’s primary subjects in her novels, a secondary subject would always be God’s ability to restore.  Hill aimed for a happy, or at least satisfactory, ending to any situation, often focusing on characters\\' new or renewed faith as impetus for resolution.\\n',\n",

[...] So that first night together was spent in the ancient bedroom with the tiny leaded paned windows, through which shafts of moonlight touched the room with a dreamlike radiance [...] \" —Eleanor Hibbert writing as Victoria Holt in The House of a Thousand Lanterns, 1974[5]\\nHibbert was born Eleanor Alice Burford on 1 September 1906 at 20 Burke Street, Canning Town, now part of the London borough of Newham.[6] She inherited a love of reading from her father, Joseph Burford, a dock labourer. Her mother was Alice Louise Burford, née Tate.\\nWhen she was quite young, bad health forced her to be privately educated at home. At the age of 16 she went to a business college, where she studied shorthand, typewriting, and languages. She then worked for a jeweller in Hatton Garden where she weighed gems and typed. She also worked as a language interpreter in a café for French and German-speaking tourists.[4]\\nIn her early twenties she married George Percival Hibbert (c. 1886–1966),[2][7] a wholesale leather merchant about twenty years older than herself, who shared her love of books and reading.[6] She was his second wife.[8] During World War II, the Hibberts lived in a cottage in Cornwall that looked out over a bay called Plaidy Beach.\\nBetween 1974 and 1978, Eleanor Hibbert bought a 13th-century manor house in Sandwich, Kent, that she named King\\'s Lodging because she believed that it had served previously as lodging for English monarchs Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.[7] The house had carved fireplaces and a staircase from the Tudor period.[9] Hibbert restored the house and furnished it opulently but soon found it too big for her taste and too far from London.[6]\\nShe then moved to a two-storey penthouse apartment at Albert Court, Kensington Gore, London, that overlooked the Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park.[4] She shared her apartment with Mrs. Molly Pascoe, a companion who also travelled with her.[10]\\nIn 1985, Hibbert sold King\\'s Lodging.[9][11]\\nHibbert spent her summers in her cottage near Plaidy Beach in Cornwall.[10] To get away from the cold English winter, Hibbert would sail around the world on board a cruise ship three months a year from January to April. The cruise would take her to exotic destinations like Egypt and Australia, locations that she later incorporated into her novels.[10][12] She sailed to Sydney aboard the cruise ship Oronsay in 1970, and the Canberra in 1978.[7]\\nTowards the end of her life, her eyesight started failing.[8]\\nEleanor Hibbert died on 18 January 1993 on the cruise ship Sea Princess somewhere between Athens, Greece and Port Said, Egypt and was buried at sea. A memorial service was later held on 6 March 1993, at St Peter\\'s Anglican Church, Kensington Park Road, London.[6]\\n\"When I was 14 and living in London, I\\'d go around Hampton Court Palace with its marvellous atmosphere, through the gateway where Anne Boleyn walked, the haunted gallery down which Katherine Howard ran. It all set me going, it all started from there.\" —Eleanor Hibbert[13]\\nEleanor Hibbert grew up in London. She first discovered her fascination for the past when she visited Hampton Court in her teenage years.[14] After her marriage, Hibbert achieved the financial independence she needed to realise her desire to write. London\\'s monuments and royal personalities filled Hibbert\\'s historical novels. She was also influenced by her regular visits to British historic homes and their architecture.[15]\\n\"I\\'ll sit in a room and think \\'This is where Charles I was when he was on the run.\\' I feel the atmosphere all around me, and that\\'s what I write about.\" —Eleanor Hibbert[15]\\nDuring World War II, the Hibberts lived in Cornwall, whose pebble beaches, high cliffs and treacherous blue waters served as the setting for many of the Victoria Holt gothic novels.[16]\\nIn later life, Hibbert took a world cruise every year.[7] Her ship called in ports of countries like Turkey, Egypt, India, South Africa, Hong Kong, Ceylon and Australia. These exotic destinations serve as the backdrop in later Victoria Holt novels. In the late 1960s, Hibbert spent two months visiting the Australian goldfields 40 miles north of Melbourne, research for her 1971 Victoria Holt novel, The Shadow of the Lynx.[17] In 1972, Hibbert travelled from Sydney to Melbourne via the Snowy Mountains and visited Hobart, Launceston, Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo.[10][12]\\n\"I love my work so much that nothing would stop me writing. I never think of the money I\\'m making. When I finish one book I start on the next. If I take even a week\\'s break I just feel miserable. It\\'s like a drug. —Eleanor Hibbert[10]\\n\"If anybody says to me \\'you look tired,\\' it\\'s because I haven\\'t been able to get at my typewriter. Writing excites me. I live all my characters and never have any trouble thinking of plots of how people would have said something because I\\'m them when I\\'m writing. —Eleanor Hibbert[9]\\nHibbert\\'s Philippa Carr novels were based partly in Cornwall and partly in Australia.\\nHibbert was influenced in her writing by the Brontës (especially the novel Jane Eyre), George Eliot, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, and Leo Tolstoy.[4]\\nDuring the 1930s, Hibbert wrote nine long novels (each about 150,000 words in length), all of them serious psychological studies of contemporary life.[18] However, none of these were accepted for publication. At the same time, she wrote short stories for newspapers including the Daily Mail and Evening News. Some also appeared in The Star, Woman\\'s Realm and Ladies\\' Home Journal. The turning point came when the fiction editor of the Daily Mail told her, \"You\\'re barking up the wrong tree: you must write something which is saleable, and the easiest way is to write romantic fiction.\"\\nHibbert read 50 romance novels as research and then published her first fiction book, Daughter of Anna, in 1941.[19] It was a period novel set in Australia of the late 18th and 19th centuries. It was a moderate success and Hibbert received £30 as advance for it. The book was published under her maiden name, Eleanor Burford, which was also used for her contemporary novels. Following the success of the book, Hibbert was contracted by Herbert Jenkins publishers to write one book a year. By 1961 Hibbert had published 31 novels under this name, including ten romance novels for Mills & Boon.\\nIn 1945, she chose the pseudonym Jean Plaidy for her new novel Together They Ride at the request of her agent.[14] The name was inspired by Plaidy Beach near the Hibberts\\' home in Looe, Cornwall during World War II.[16] Her agent suggested the first name, saying \"Jean doesn\\'t take much room at the back of the book\".[14] The book was published by Gerald G. Swan, a London publisher.[4] The next book written under the Jean Plaidy pseudonym was Beyond the Blue Mountains in 1948. The publisher Robert Hale accepted the 500-page manuscript after it had been rejected by several others. The firm wrote to Hibbert\\'s literary agency, A.M. Heath, \"Will you tell this author that there are glittering prizes ahead for those who can write as she does?\".[8] In 1949, Hibbert hit her stride with the first Jean Plaidy novel that fictionalized stories of royalty: The King\\'s Pleasure, featuring Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.[20] A total of 91 Jean Plaidy novels were published. Hibbert\\'s last Jean Plaidy book, The Rose Without a Thorn, was published posthumously.[4]\\nHibbert also wrote four non-fiction books under the pseudonym Jean Plaidy. The first, A Triptych of Poisoners (1958), was a collection of short biographies of poisoners: Cesare Borgia, Marie d\\'Aubray and Edward William Pritchard. The other three were a trilogy on the Spanish Inquisition: The Rise (1959), The Growth (1960) and The End (1961).\\nFrom 1950 to 1953, Hibbert wrote four novels as Elbur Ford, a pen name derived from her maiden name, Eleanor Burford. These novels were based on real-life murderers of the nineteenth century:  Edward William Pritchard (Flesh and the Devil, 1950); Adelaide Bartlett (Poison in Pimlico, 1950); Euphrasie Mercier[21] (The Bed Disturbed, 1952) and Constance Kent (Such Bitter Business, 1953 – published in the U.S. in 1954 under the title Evil in the House).\\nBetween 1952 and 1960, Hibbert used the pseudonym Kathleen Kellow to write eight novels that were mostly crime and mystery fiction. From 1956 to 1961, she wrote five novels as Ellalice Tate, a pseudonym inspired by her mother\\'s name, Alice Tate.[22]\\n\"I\\'ve always wanted to write a best-seller. Every writer does. It\\'s really a matter of finding out what the public wants. —Eleanor Hibbert[18]\\nIn 1960, at the suggestion of her agent, Patricia Schartle Myrer, she wrote her first Gothic romance, Mistress of Mellyn, under the name Victoria Holt. The pseudonym was created by choosing the name Victoria for its regal, romantic ring while the name Holt was taken from the military bank of Holt & Company where Hibbert had an account.[18][23] Published by Doubleday in the United States and Collins in the United Kingdom, Mistress of Mellyn became an instant international bestseller and revived the Gothic romantic suspense genre.[2][8][24][25]\\n\"I have heard her name mentioned in connection with mine and I think it is because we both lived in Cornwall and have written about this place. Rebecca is the atmospheric suspense type of book mine are. But I don’t think there is much similarity between her others and mine.\" —Daphne du Maurier commenting on the similarity between Victoria Holt\\'s novels and her own.[9]\\nMistress of Mellyn was a clever weaving of elements from earlier Gothic novels such as Jane Eyre (1847), The Woman in White (1859), and Rebecca (1938). Its setting in Cornwall made the resemblance to Rebecca (1938) so remarkable that it was speculated that Victoria Holt was a pseudonym for Daphne du Maurier.[15][26] After six Victoria Holt novels were published over eight years, it was revealed that Hibbert was the author.[9] Hibbert wrote a further 31 novels as Victoria Holt, primarily portraying fictitious characters set against an authentic period background, usually of the late 19th century. The last Victoria Holt novel, The Black Opal, was published after her death.[8]\\nIn 1960, Hibbert wrote a novel under the name Anna Percival, a pseudonym inspired by her husband\\'s middle name, Percival. Hibbert never used that pen name again.\\nShe created her last pseudonym, Philippa Carr, in 1972 at the suggestion of her publisher, Collins, to create a new series showing successive generations of English gentlewomen involved in important historical events starting with the Reformation and ending with World War II.[8]\\nHibbert continued to use the pseudonym Jean Plaidy for her historical novels about the crowned heads of Europe. Her books written under this pseudonym were popular with the general public and were also hailed by critics and historians for their historical accuracy, quality of writing, and attention to detail.[27]\\nNumber of books written per decade under different pseudonyms\\nHibbert based her research on the writings of British historians such as John Speed, James Anthony Froude, Alexander Fraser Tytler and Agnes Strickland.[4]\\nEach of Hibbert\\'s Jean Plaidy books featured a bibliography at the end, listing the historical works consulted during the process of writing the book.[28]\\nThe Kensington Central Library gave Hibbert special concessions to aid her research. She was allowed to go down to the vault where the out-of-circulation books were stored, and borrow them a trolley-load at a time.[10] She was even allowed to take the books home and keep them as long as she wanted.[9]\\nWhen her eyesight started failing towards the end of her life, she borrowed audiobooks from the Westminster City Council public libraries.[8]\\nHibbert was a prolific writer, churning out multiple books in a year under different pseudonyms, chiefly Jean Plaidy, Victoria Holt and Philippa Carr.[29][30] Jean Plaidy proved very popular in the United Kingdom, selling large quantities in paperback while Victoria Holt was a bestseller in the United States. Many of her readers never realized that behind all these pen names was a single author.[31][32][33]\\nHibbert attributed her large output to her regular working habits. She described herself as a compulsive writer and would write all seven days in the week. She started every morning at the typewriter on her desk, usually completing five thousand words by lunchtime.[19] Though writing stimulated her, she found the typewriter to be a physical strain. She devoted five hours every day to her writing, in addition to the time that it took her to proof-read her draft and conduct research. In the afternoon, she would personally answer all the fan mail she received. She would also spend time at Kensington Central Library. In the evening, she played chess if she could find an opponent or attended social engagements.[14]\\nEven while on her annual cruise around the world, Hibbert maintained her discipline. She wrote in the mornings, played chess in the afternoons, and joined in the shipboard entertainments in the evenings. She preferred to work on her Victoria Holt novels while on board the cruise ship because they did not require as much research or fact-checking at a library.[12]\\nEleanor Hibbert enjoyed healthy, lifelong relationships with her literary agents and publishers, a rare feat in the publishing world.[8] She was represented in the United Kingdom by A.M. Heath Literary Agency and by McIntosh & Otis in the United States. Her long-time American agent was Patricia Schartle Myrer followed by Julie Fallowfield.\\nLondon publisher Herbert Jenkins published 20 light romantic novels from 1941 to 1955 that Hibbert wrote under the pen name Eleanor Burford. The contract, initially for one book a year at an advance of £30 a title, was later revised to two books a year when the books proved successful.[4]\\nMills and Boon, a London publisher that specialised in low-priced, paperback, romantic novels brought out 10 romance novels from 1956 to 1962 that Hibbert wrote under the pen name Eleanor Burford.\\nGerald G Swan published the first Jean Plaidy book in 1945 but every one after that was published by Robert Hale. Starting with Beyond the Blue Mountains (1948) and extending over the entire course of her lifetime, Robert Hale published a total of 90 Jean Plaidy books in hardcover with dust jackets illustrated by specialist artist Philip Gough.[4]\\nMacRae Smith Co. of Philadelphia published Jean Plaidy titles in the United States. Foreign language editions of Jean Plaidy books began appearing in 1956: in French by Éditions Robert Laffont, Paris; in Spanish by Guillermo Kraft Limitada, Buenos Aires; and in Dutch by Uitgeverij A.J. Luitingh, Amsterdam.\\nIn 1951, Canadian paperback publishers Harlequin reprinted Jean Plaidy\\'s Beyond the Blue Mountains in paperback to achieve their greatest commercial success to that date: of the 30,000 copies sold, only 48 were returned.[34]\\nRobert Hale published eight Kathleen Kellow crime and mystery novels between 1952 and 1960 in hardcover with dust jackets by Philip Gough. Robert Hale also published the sole book written under the Anna Percival pseudonym, The Brides of Lanlory.[4]\\nFrom 1950 to 1953, four Elbur Ford crime novels were published by London publisher William Morrow in the United Kingdom and New York publisher Werner Laurie in the United States.\\nFrom 1956 to 1961, Hodder & Stoughton published all five historical novels written under the pseudonym Ellalice Tate.[4]\\nFrom 1960 to 1993, Hibbert wrote 32 Victoria Holt novels for the publishing giants Collins in the United Kingdom and Doubleday in the United States. Many of them were bestsellers and were translated into 20 languages to reach a worldwide audience.\\nFrom 1972 to 1993, Hibbert wrote 19 Philippa Carr novels that were published by Collins in the United Kingdom and Putnam in the United States. A few of them were later translated into foreign languages such as Spanish, Finnish, Russian and Polish.\\nBy the time of her death in 1993, Hibbert had sold 75 million books translated in 20 languages under the name Victoria Holt, 14 million under the name Jean Plaidy and 3 million under the name Philippa Carr.[2][35]\\nAfter her death, Mark Hamilton of the A.M. Heath Literary Agency took over as executor for her literary estate, estimated to be worth about £8,790,807 at probate.[6][36]\\nThe book The Love Child published in 1950 by Eleanor Burford must not be mistaken for the same-titled novel by Philippa Carr published in 1978 as part of the Daughters of England Series.[37]\\nMany Jean Plaidy books were published under different titles in the United States. Her trilogies were also later re-published as single books, often under different titles than those shown.\\nJean Plaidy historical novels were welcomed by readers who found them to be an easy way to gain insight into a sweeping panorama of European history.\\nIt was common for school girls in England to read these in history lessons, whilst hiding them behind their proper text books.\\nIn the last decade of the 20th century, historical fiction went out of fashion. Jean Plaidy titles went out of print.\\nIn October 2001, Rachel Kahan, associate editor at Crown Publishing Group, and Jean Plaidy fan since childhood, discovered that Jean Plaidy books had gone out of print in the United States.\\n\"I felt awful – like when you learn that an old friend who you haven\\'t seen for many years has suddenly died. But in this case, I was not just a fan mourning the loss of all those great novels, I was actually in a position to do something about it.\" —Rachel Kahan, on discovering in 2003 that Jean Plaidy books had gone out of print in the United States.[20]\\nKahan bought the reprint rights to ten Jean Plaidy novels. In April 2003, Crown chose to publish two books under the Three Rivers Press imprint, both featuring Henry VIII. The Lady in the Tower and The Rose Without a Thorn tell the story of two of his six wives, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, both of whom were beheaded. The books were published in paperback with new titles, modern covers and a readers\\' guide at the back. The first printing of 30,000 copies of each book sold out in 3 months. Based on this success, Crown\\'s United Kingdom unit, Arrow Books, bought the entire Jean Plaidy backlist.[38]\\nIn the Spring of 2003 Three Rivers Press, an imprint of U.S.A. publisher Crown Publishing Group, started republishing Jean Plaidy\\'s stories.[39][40] Three Rivers Press published some of the books with new titles which are listed here:\\nSome of these novels were re-published under the Jean Plaidy name.\\nAll these novels were later re-published under the Jean Plaidy name.\\nVictoria Holt books proved popular with the reading public and many of them made it to bestseller lists. Hibbert won loyalty from large numbers of women readers who passed along their copies to the next generation of women in their family. Hibbert described her heroines as \"women of integrity and strong character\" who were \"struggling for liberation, fighting for their own survival.\"\\n\"A Victoria Holt book is the sort of story to bring despair to literary critics, and rage to supporters of Women\\'s Lib though it would give a great deal of pleasurable entertainment to vast numbers of ordinary women all over the world.\" – a critic[13]\\nHer 1960 novel Mistress of Mellyn single-handedly revived the Gothic romance genre.[15] Many women started writing their own gothic romances. Even male authors like Tom E. Huff and Julian Fellowes succumbed to the trend and wrote romances under female pseudonyms.[42][43][44][45]\\nVictoria Holt novels became best-sellers. In 1970, when gothic mania was at its peak, The Secret Woman became one of the top 10 best-selling books in the United States.[46] By 1975, a Victoria Holt paperback began with a first printing of 800,000 copies.[47]\\nBy the early 1970s gothic novels outsold all other genres in paperback fiction, including mysteries, science fiction and Westerns. This coincided with consolidation within the publishing industry where paperbacks and hardcover publishers were brought together under the same corporate parent for the first time. More sophisticated marketing efforts led to placement in grocery and drugstore checkout aisles, where they found their target audience: educated, middle-class women with a reading habit.[48]\\nHibbert\\'s romance novels were clean; at the most the main characters exchanged smouldering looks of longing. However, by 1969 the sexual revolution had made explicit description more acceptable. In April 1972, the romance novel The Flame and the Flower took advantage of this change in trend and revolutionized the historical romance genre by detailing physical intimacy between the protagonists. Another such novel, Sweet Savage Love, that followed in 1974 cemented the trend. A new genre was thus born, dubbed the \\'sweet savage romance\\' or the \\'bodice ripper\\' because of the heaving, partly exposed bosom often pictured on the cover.[49][50]\\nInterest in Hibbert\\'s clean romances declined. In 1976, a critic complained that Victoria Holt\\'s heroines \"must be a little bit dumb or they won\\'t get themselves into such improbable messes in the first place.\"[51] The next Victoria Holt novel, The Devil on Horseback (1977), was described as \"from another era, sort of out of step with today\\'s style.\"[52] Critics judged the books as falling \"short of her previous standards.\"[53]\\n\"Today\\'s novels are \\'bodice rippers\\' and about as pure as driven slush.\" – a book critic in 1982[54]\\n\"In these books, innocent young virgins are carried off unwillingly by sensual, often primitive older men to picturesque lairs: by pirates to their galleons, Arabs to their harems, Indians to their tepees, knights to their castles. Early in the plot, the woman is ravished against her will and there is sex throughout the story.\" – a book critic describing the \\'bodice-ripper\\' type of romance novel in 1985[55]\\nBy the early 1980s, Gothic romances were no longer as popular as a decade earlier. Readers demanded more sex and adventure in their romance novels. Publishers created paperback imprints like Silhouette and Candlelight Ecstasy simply to satisfy the enormous demand for \"bodice rippers\" and \"hot historicals\".[54][56]\\nBowing to the changing times, Hibbert wrote The Demon Lover, a 1982 Victoria Holt novel, in a style that borrowed several elements from the plot of Sweet Savage Love: forced seduction of a naive girl by a powerful man ending in marriage, set against a background of turmoil in war time. Critics congratulated the move: \"Her latest, \\'The Demon Lover\\', is a straight romance with sexual passion, which is currently \\'in\\'. It has no suspense: the thrilling twists and turns of plot that marked her Gothic novels are no more.\"[57]\\nVictoria Holt\\'s heroines left the decorous drawing rooms of Victorian England to find adventure in far more exotic locations: inside an Egyptian pyramid (The Curse of the Kings, 1973); among Chinese antiques in Hong Kong (The House of a Thousand Lanterns, 1974);[58] down the opal mines of Australia (The Pride of the Peacock, 1976); on a tea plantation in Ceylon (The Spring of the Tiger, 1979);[59] among lush, tropical islands off the coast of Australia (The Road to Paradise Island, 1985);[60] in Crimea with Florence Nightingale (Secret for a Nightingale, 1986); in mutiny-filled British India (The India Fan, 1988); in a Turkish nobleman\\'s harem in Constantinople (The Captive, 1989);[61] in the British colonies of South Africa (Snare of Serpents, 1990); and on a shipwreck in the South Sea Islands (The Black Opal, 1993).\\nIn 1993, Hibbert died. In the closing years of the 20th century, Victoria Holt titles were made available in large print, audiobook and Braille formats. Translations in several European languages, Russian, Hebrew, Persian, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese also appeared.\\n\"Never regret. If it\\'s good, it\\'s wonderful. If it\\'s bad, it\\'s experience.\" —Eleanor Hibbert writing as Victoria Holt in The Black Opal, 1993.[62]\\nIn 2006, London publisher Harper reprinted four of Victoria Holt\\'s most popular titles with new covers: Mistress of Mellyn (1961), The Shivering Sands (1969), The Shadow of the Lynx (1971) and The Time of the Hunter\\'s Moon (1983). Foreign language translations in European languages, Japanese, Sinhalese and Thai were also published that year.\\n',\n",

He is considered to be one of the greatest writers of all time.\\nHis most famous works are the novels The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (1831) and Les Misérables (1862). In France, Hugo is renowned for his poetry collections, such as Les Contemplations (The Contemplations) and La Légende des siècles (The Legend of the Ages). Hugo was at the forefront of the Romantic literary movement with his play Cromwell and drama Hernani. Many of his works have inspired music, both during his lifetime and after his death, including the opera Rigoletto and the musicals Les Misérables and Notre-Dame de Paris. He produced more than 4,000 drawings in his lifetime, and campaigned for social causes such as the abolition of capital punishment.\\nAlthough he was a committed royalist when young, Hugo\\'s views changed as the decades passed, and he became a passionate supporter of republicanism, serving in politics as both deputy and senator. His work touched upon most of the political and social issues and the artistic trends of his time. His opposition to absolutism, and his literary stature, established him as a national hero. Hugo died on 22 May 1885, aged 83. He was given a state funeral in the Panthéon of Paris, which was attended by over 2 million people, the largest in French history.[1]\\nVictor-Marie Hugo was born on 26 February 1802 in Besançon in Eastern France. He was the youngest son of Joseph Léopold Sigisbert Hugo (1774–1828), a general in the Napoleonic army, and Sophie Trébuchet (1772–1821). The couple had two other sons: Abel Joseph (1798–1855) and Eugène (1800–1837). The Hugo family came from Nancy in Lorraine, where Victor Hugo\\'s grandfather was a wood merchant. Léopold enlisted in the army of Revolutionary France at fourteen. He was an atheist and an ardent supporter of the Republic. Victor\\'s mother Sophie was loyal to the deposed dynasty but would declare her children to be Protestants.[2][3][4] They met in Châteaubriant in 1796 and married the following year.[5]\\nSince Hugo\\'s father was an officer in Napoleon\\'s army, the family moved frequently from posting to posting. Léopold Hugo wrote to his son that he had been conceived on one of the highest peaks in the Vosges Mountains, on a journey from Lunéville to Besançon. \"This elevated origin,\" he went on, \"seems to have had effects on you so that your muse is now continually sublime.\"[6] Hugo believed himself to have been conceived on 24 June 1801, which is the origin of Jean Valjean\\'s prisoner number 24601.[7]\\nIn 1810, Hugo\\'s father was made Count Hugo de Cogolludo y Sigüenza by then King of Spain Joseph Bonaparte,[8] though it seems that the Spanish title was not legally recognized in France. Hugo later titled himself as a viscount, and it was as \"Vicomte Victor Hugo\" that he was appointed a peer of France on 13 April 1845.[9][10]\\nWeary of the constant moving required by military life, Sophie separated temporarily from Léopold and settled in Paris in 1803 with her sons. There, she began seeing General Victor Fanneau de La Horie, Hugo\\'s godfather, who had been a comrade of General Hugo\\'s during the campaign in Vendee. In October 1807, the family rejoined Leopold, now Colonel Hugo, Governor of the province of Avellino. There, Victor was taught mathematics by Giuseppe de Samuele Cagnazzi, elder brother of Italian scientist Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi.[11] Sophie found out that Leopold had been living in secret with an Englishwoman called Catherine Thomas.[12]\\nSophie Trébuchet, mother of Victor Hugo\\nGeneral Joseph-Leopold Hugo, father of Victor Hugo\\nSoon Hugo\\'s father was called to Spain to fight the Peninsular War. Madame Hugo and her children were sent back to Paris in 1808, where they moved to an old convent, 12 Impasse des Feuillantines, an isolated mansion in a deserted quarter of the left bank of the Seine. Hiding in a chapel at the back of the garden was de La Horie, who had conspired to restore the Bourbons and been condemned to death a few years earlier. He became a mentor to Victor and his brothers.[13]\\nIn 1811 the family joined their father in Spain. Victor and his brothers were sent to school in Madrid at the Real Colegio de San Antonio de Abad while Sophie returned to Paris on her own, now officially separated from her husband. In 1812 de La Horie was arrested and executed. In February 1815 Victor and Eugene were taken away from their mother and placed by their father in the Pension Cordier, a private boarding school in Paris, where Victor and Eugène remained for three years while also attending lectures at Lycée Louis le Grand.[14]\\nOn 10 July 1816, Hugo wrote in his diary: \"I shall be Chateaubriand or nothing.\" In 1817 he wrote a poem for a competition organised by the Academie Française, for which he received an honorable mention. The Academicians refused to believe that he was only fifteen.[15] Victor moved in with his mother to 18 rue des Petits-Augustins the following year and began attending law school. Victor fell in love and secretly became engaged, against his mother\\'s wishes, to his childhood friend Adèle Foucher. In June 1821 Sophie Trebuchet died, and Léopold married his long-time mistress Catherine Thomas a month later. Victor married Adèle the following year. In 1819, Victor and his brothers began publishing a periodical called Le Conservateur littéraire.[16]\\nHugo published his first novel (Han d\\'Islande\\xa0[fr], 1823) the year following his marriage, and his second three years later (Bug-Jargal, 1826). Between 1829 and 1840, he published five more volumes of poetry: Les Orientales, 1829; Les Feuilles d\\'automne, 1831; Les Chants du crépuscule\\xa0[fr], 1835; Les Voix intérieures, 1837; and Les Rayons et les Ombres, 1840. This cemented his reputation as one of the greatest elegiac and lyric poets of his time.\\nLike many young writers of his generation, Hugo was profoundly influenced by François-René de Chateaubriand, the famous figure in the literary movement of Romanticism and France\\'s pre-eminent literary figure during the early 19th century. In his youth, Hugo resolved to be \"Chateaubriand or nothing\", and his life would come to parallel that of his predecessor in many ways. Like Chateaubriand, Hugo furthered the cause of Romanticism, became involved in politics (though mostly as a champion of Republicanism), and was forced into exile due to his political stances.\\nThe precocious passion and eloquence of Hugo\\'s early work brought success and fame at an early age. His first collection of poetry (Odes et poésies diverses) was published in 1822 when he was only 20 years old and earned him a royal pension from Louis XVIII. Though the poems were admired for their spontaneous fervor and fluency, the collection that followed four years later in 1826 (Odes et Ballades) revealed Hugo to be a great poet, a natural master of lyric and creative song.\\nVictor Hugo\\'s first mature work of fiction was published in February 1829 by Charles Gosselin without the author\\'s name and reflected the acute social conscience that would infuse his later work. Le Dernier jour d\\'un condamné (The Last Day of a Condemned Man) would have a profound influence on later writers such as Albert Camus, Charles Dickens, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Claude Gueux, a documentary short story about a real-life murderer who had been executed in France, was published in 1834. Hugo himself later considered it to be a precursor to his great work on social injustice, Les Misérables.\\nHugo became the figurehead of the Romantic literary movement with the plays Cromwell (1827) and Hernani (1830).[18] Hernani announced the arrival of French romanticism: performed at the Comédie-Française, it was greeted with several nights of rioting as romantics and traditionalists clashed over the play\\'s deliberate disregard for neo-classical rules. Hugo\\'s popularity as a playwright grew with subsequent plays, such as Marion Delorme (1831), Le roi s\\'amuse (1832), and Ruy Blas (1838).[19] Hugo\\'s novel Notre-Dame de Paris (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame) was published in 1831 and quickly translated into other languages across Europe. One of the effects of the novel was to shame the City of Paris into restoring the much neglected Cathedral of Notre Dame, which was attracting thousands of tourists who had read the popular novel.\\nHugo began planning a major novel about social misery and injustice as early as the 1830s, but a full 17 years were needed for Les Misérables to be realised and finally published in 1862. Hugo had previously used the departure of prisoners for the Bagne of Toulon in Le Dernier Jour d\\'un condamné. He went to Toulon to visit the Bagne in 1839 and took extensive notes, though he did not start writing the book until 1845. On one of the pages of his notes about the prison, he wrote in large block letters a possible name for his hero: \"JEAN TRÉJEAN\". When the book was finally written, Tréjean became Jean Valjean.[20]\\nHugo was acutely aware of the quality of the novel, as evidenced in a letter he wrote to his publisher, Albert Lacroix, on 23 March 1862: \"My conviction is that this book is going to be one of the peaks, if not the crowning point of my work.\"[21] Publication of Les Misérables went to the highest bidder. The Belgian publishing house Lacroix and Verboeckhoven undertook a marketing campaign unusual for the time, issuing press releases about the work a full six months before the launch. It also initially published only the first part of the novel (\"Fantine\"), which was launched simultaneously in major cities. Installments of the book sold out within hours and had an enormous impact on French society.\\nThe critical establishment was generally hostile to the novel; Taine found it insincere, Barbey d\\'Aurevilly complained of its vulgarity, Gustave Flaubert found within it \"neither truth nor greatness\", the Goncourt brothers lambasted its artificiality, and Baudelaire—despite giving favourable reviews in newspapers—castigated it in private as \"repulsive and inept\". However, Les Misérables proved popular enough with the masses that the issues it highlighted were soon on the agenda of the National Assembly of France. Today, the novel remains his best-known work. It is popular worldwide and has been adapted for cinema, television, and stage shows.\\nAn apocryphal tale[22] has circulated, describing the shortest correspondence in history as having been between Hugo and his publisher Hurst and Blackett in 1862. Hugo was on vacation when Les Misérables was published. He queried the reaction to the work by sending a single-character telegram to his publisher, asking ?. The publisher replied with a single ! to indicate its success.[23] Hugo turned away from social/political issues in his next novel, Les Travailleurs de la Mer (Toilers of the Sea), published in 1866. The book was well received, perhaps due to the previous success of Les Misérables. Dedicated to the channel island of Guernsey, where Hugo spent 15 years of exile, the novel tells of a man who attempts to win the approval of his beloved\\'s father by rescuing his ship, intentionally marooned by its captain who hopes to escape with a treasure of money it is transporting, through an exhausting battle of human engineering against the force of the sea and an almost mythical beast of the sea, a giant squid. Superficially an adventure, one of Hugo\\'s biographers calls it a \"metaphor for the 19th century–technical progress, creative genius and hard work overcoming the immanent evil of the material world.\"[24]\\nThe word used in Guernsey to refer to squid (pieuvre, also sometimes applied to octopus) was to enter the French language as a result of its use in the book. Hugo returned to political and social issues in his next novel, L\\'Homme Qui Rit (The Man Who Laughs), which was published in 1869 and painted a critical picture of the aristocracy. The novel was not as successful as his previous efforts, and Hugo himself began to comment on the growing distance between himself and literary contemporaries such as Flaubert and Émile Zola, whose realist and naturalist novels were now exceeding the popularity of his own work.\\nHis last novel, Quatre-vingt-treize (Ninety-Three), published in 1874, dealt with a subject that Hugo had previously avoided: the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution. Though Hugo\\'s popularity was on the decline at the time of its publication, many now consider Ninety-Three to be a work on par with Hugo\\'s better-known novels.\\nAfter three unsuccessful attempts, Hugo was finally elected to the Académie française in 1841, solidifying his position in the world of French arts and letters. A group of French academicians, particularly Étienne de Jouy, were fighting against the \"romantic evolution\" and had managed to delay Victor Hugo\\'s election.[25] Thereafter, he became increasingly involved in French politics.\\nOn the nomination of King Louis-Philippe, Hugo entered the Upper Chamber of Parliament as a pair de France in 1845, where he spoke against the death penalty and social injustice, and in favour of freedom of the press and self-government for Poland.\\nIn 1848, Hugo was elected to the National Assembly of the Second Republic as a conservative. In 1849, he broke with the conservatives when he gave a noted speech calling for the end of misery and poverty. Other speeches called for universal suffrage and free education for all children. Hugo\\'s advocacy to abolish the death penalty was renowned internationally.[note 1]\\nWhen Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III) seized complete power in 1851, establishing an anti-parliamentary constitution, Hugo openly declared him a traitor to France. He moved to Brussels, then Jersey, from which he was expelled for supporting a Jersey newspaper that had criticised Queen Victoria. He finally settled with his family at Hauteville House in Saint Peter Port, Guernsey, where he would live in exile from October 1855 until 1870.\\nWhile in exile, Hugo published his famous political pamphlets against Napoleon III, Napoléon le Petit and Histoire d\\'un crime. The pamphlets were banned in France but nonetheless had a strong impact there. He also composed or published some of his best work during his period in Guernsey, including Les Misérables, and three widely praised collections of poetry (Les Châtiments, 1853; Les Contemplations, 1856; and La Légende des siècles, 1859).\\nHowever, Víctor Hugo said in The Misérables:[27]\\nThe wretched moral character of Thénardier, the frustrated bourgeois, was hopeless; it was in America what it had been in Europe. Contact with a wicked man is sometimes enough to rot a good deed and cause something bad to come out of it. With Marius\\'s money, Thénardier became a slave trader.Like most of his contemporaries, Hugo justified colonialism in terms of a civilizing mission and putting an end to the slave trade on the Barbary coast. In a speech delivered on 18 May 1879, during a banquet to celebrate the abolition of slavery, in the presence of the French abolitionist writer and parliamentarian Victor Schœlcher, Hugo declared that the Mediterranean Sea formed a natural divide between \"ultimate civilisation and ... utter barbarism,\" adding, \"God offers Africa to Europe. Take it\", to civilise its indigenous inhabitants.\\nThis might partly explain why in spite of his deep interest and involvement in political matters he remained silent on the Algerian issue. He knew about the atrocities committed by the French Army during the French conquest of Algeria as evidenced by his diary[28] but he never denounced them publicly; however, in Les Misérables, Hugo wrote: \"Algeria too harshly conquered, and, as in the case of India by the English, with more barbarism than civilization.\"[29]\\n\\nAfter coming in contact with Victor Schœlcher, a writer who fought for the abolition of slavery and French colonialism in the Caribbean, he started strongly campaigning against slavery. In a letter to American abolitionist Maria Weston Chapman, on 6 July 1851, Hugo wrote: \"Slavery in the United States! It is the duty of this republic to set such a bad example no longer.... The United States must renounce slavery, or they must renounce liberty.\"[30] In 1859, he wrote a letter asking the United States government, for the sake of their own reputation in the future, to spare abolitionist John Brown\\'s life, Hugo justified Brown\\'s actions by these words: \"Assuredly, if insurrection is ever a sacred duty, it must be when it is directed against Slavery.\"[31] Hugo agreed to diffuse and sell one of his best known drawings, \"Le Pendu\", an homage to John Brown, so one could \"keep alive in souls the memory of this liberator of our black brothers, of this heroic martyr John Brown, who died for Christ just as Christ.[32]Only one slave on Earth is enough to dishonour the freedom of all men. So the abolition of slavery is, at this hour, the supreme goal of the thinkers.As a novelist, diarist, and member of Parliament, Victor Hugo fought a lifelong battle for the abolition of the death penalty. The Last Day of a Condemned Man published in 1829 analyses the pangs of a man awaiting execution; several entries in Things Seen (Choses vues), the diary he kept between 1830 and 1885, convey his firm condemnation of what he regarded as a barbaric sentence;[34] on 15 September 1848, seven months after the Revolution of 1848, he delivered a speech before the Assembly and concluded, \"You have overthrown the throne. ... Now overthrow the scaffold.\"[35] His influence was credited in the removal of the death penalty from the constitutions of Geneva, Portugal, and Colombia.[36] He had also pleaded for Benito Juárez to spare the recently captured emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, but to no avail.[37]\\nAlthough Napoleon III granted an amnesty to all political exiles in 1859, Hugo declined, as it meant he would have to curtail his criticisms of the government. It was only after Napoleon III fell from power and the Third Republic was proclaimed that Hugo finally returned to his homeland in 1870, where he was promptly elected to the National Assembly and the Senate.\\nHe was in Paris during the siege by the Prussian Army in 1870, famously eating animals given to him by the Paris Zoo. As the siege continued, and food became ever more scarce, he wrote in his diary that he was reduced to \"eating the unknown\".[38]\\nDuring the Paris Commune—the revolutionary government that took power on 18 March 1871 and was toppled on 28 May—Victor Hugo was harshly critical of the atrocities committed on both sides. On 9 April, he wrote in his diary, \"In short, this Commune is as idiotic as the National Assembly is ferocious. From both sides, folly.\"[39] Yet he made a point of offering his support to members of the Commune subjected to brutal repression. He had been in Brussels since 22 March 1871 when in the 27 May issue of the Belgian newspaper l’Indépendance Victor Hugo denounced the government\\'s refusal to grant political asylum to the Communards threatened with imprisonment, banishment or execution.[40] This caused so much uproar that in the evening a mob of fifty to sixty men attempted to force their way into the writer\\'s house shouting, \"Death to Victor Hugo! Hang him! Death to the scoundrel!\"[41]\\nHugo, who said \"A war between Europeans is a civil war,\"[42] was an enthusiastic advocate for the creation of the United States of Europe. He expounded his views on the subject in a speech he delivered during the International Peace Congress which took place in Paris in 1849. The Congress, of which Hugo was the president, proved to be an international success, attracting such famous philosophers as Frederic Bastiat, Charles Gilpin, Richard Cobden, and Henry Richard. The conference helped establish Hugo as a prominent public speaker and sparked his international fame, and promoted the idea of the \"United States of Europe\".[43] On 14 July 1870 he planted the \"oak of the United States of Europe\" in the garden of Hauteville House where he stayed during his exile on Guernsey from 1856 to 1870. The massacres of Balkan Christians by the Turks in 1876 inspired him to write Pour la Serbie (For Serbia) in his sons\\' newspaper Le Rappel. This speech is today considered one of the founding acts of the European ideal.[44]\\nBecause of his concern for the rights of artists and copyright, he was a founding member of the Association Littéraire et Artistique Internationale, which led to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. However, in Pauvert\\'s published archives, he states strongly that \"any work of art has two authors: the people who confusingly feel something, a creator who translates these feelings, and the people again who consecrate his vision of that feeling. When one of the authors dies, the rights should totally be granted back to the other, the people.\" He was one of the earlier supporters of the concept of domaine public payant, under which a nominal fee would be charged for copying or performing works in the public domain, and this would go into a common fund dedicated to helping artists, especially young people.\\nHugo\\'s religious views changed radically over the course of his life. In his youth and under the influence of his mother, he identified as a Catholic and professed respect for Church hierarchy and authority. From there he became a non-practising Catholic and increasingly expressed anti-Catholic and anti-clerical views. He frequented spiritism during his exile (where he participated also in many séances conducted by Madame Delphine de Girardin)[45][46] and in later years settled into a rationalist deism similar to that espoused by Voltaire. A census-taker asked Hugo in 1872 if he was a Catholic, and he replied, \"No. A Freethinker.\"[47]\\nAfter 1872, Hugo never lost his antipathy towards the Catholic Church. He felt the Church was indifferent to the plight of the working class under the oppression of the monarchy. Perhaps he also was upset by the frequency with which his work appeared on the Church\\'s list of banned books. Hugo counted 740 attacks on Les Misérables in the Catholic press.[48] When Hugo\\'s sons Charles and François-Victor died, he insisted that they be buried without a crucifix or priest. In his will, he made the same stipulation about his own death and funeral.[49]\\nYet he believed in life after death and prayed every single morning and night, convinced as he wrote in The Man Who Laughs that \"Thanksgiving has wings and flies to its right destination. Your prayer knows its way better than you do.\"[50]\\nHugo\\'s rationalism can be found in poems such as Torquemada (1869, about religious fanaticism), The Pope (1878, anti-clerical), Religions and Religion (1880, denying the usefulness of churches) and, published posthumously, The End of Satan and God (1886 and 1891 respectively, in which he represents Christianity as a griffin and rationalism as an angel). \\n\\'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\\' also garnered attention due to its portrayal of the abuse of power by the church, even getting listed as one of the \\'forbidden books\\' by it. In fact, earlier adaptations had to change the villain, Claude Frollo from being a priest to avoid backlash.[51]\\nVincent van Gogh ascribed the saying \"Religions pass away, but God remains,\" actually by Jules Michelet, to Hugo.[52]\\nAlthough Hugo\\'s many talents did not include exceptional musical ability, he nevertheless had a great impact on the music world through the inspiration that his works provided for composers of the 19th and 20th centuries. Hugo himself particularly enjoyed the music of Gluck, Mozart, Weber and Meyerbeer. In Les Misérables, he calls the huntsman\\'s chorus in Weber\\'s Euryanthe, \"perhaps the most beautiful piece of music ever composed\".[53] He also greatly admired Beethoven and, rather unusually for his time, appreciated works by composers from earlier centuries such as Palestrina and Monteverdi.[54]\\nTwo famous musicians of the 19th century were friends of Hugo: Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt. The latter played Beethoven in Hugo\\'s home, and Hugo joked in a letter to a friend that, thanks to Liszt\\'s piano lessons, he learned how to play a favourite song on the piano – with only one finger. Hugo also worked with composer Louise Bertin, writing the libretto for her 1836 opera La Esmeralda, which was based on the character in The Hunchback of Notre Dame.[54] Although for various reasons the opera closed soon after its fifth performance and is little known today, it has enjoyed a modern revival, both in a piano/song concert version by Liszt at the Festival international Victor Hugo et Égaux 2007[55] and in a full orchestral version presented in July 2008 at Le Festival de Radio France et Montpellier Languedoc-Roussillon.[56] He was also on friendly terms with Frederic Chopin. He introduced him to George Sand who would be his lover for years. In 1849, Hugo attended Chopins funeral.\\nOn the other hand, he had low esteem for Richard Wagner, whom he described as \"a man of talent coupled with imbecility.\"[57]\\nWell over one thousand musical compositions have been inspired by Hugo\\'s works from the 19th century until the present day. In particular, Hugo\\'s plays, in which he rejected the rules of classical theatre in favour of romantic drama, attracted the interest of many composers who adapted them into operas. More than one hundred operas are based on Hugo\\'s works and among them are Donizetti\\'s Lucrezia Borgia (1833), Verdi\\'s Rigoletto (1851) and Ernani (1844), and Ponchielli\\'s La Gioconda (1876).[58]\\nHugo\\'s novels, as well as his plays, have been a great source of inspiration for musicians, stirring them to create not only opera and ballet but musical theatre such as Notre-Dame de Paris and the ever-popular Les Misérables, London West End\\'s longest running musical. Additionally, Hugo\\'s poems have attracted an exceptional amount of interest from musicians, and numerous melodies have been based on his poetry by composers such as Berlioz, Bizet, Fauré, Franck, Lalo, Liszt, Massenet, Saint-Saëns, Rachmaninoff, and Wagner.[58]\\nToday, Hugo\\'s work continues to stimulate musicians to create new compositions. For example, Hugo\\'s novel against capital punishment, The Last Day of a Condemned Man, was adapted into an opera by David Alagna, with a libretto by Frédérico Alagna and premièred by their brother, tenor Roberto Alagna, in 2007.[59] In Guernsey, every two years, the Victor Hugo International Music Festival attracts a wide range of musicians and the premiere of songs specially commissioned from such composers as Guillaume Connesson, Richard Dubugnon\\xa0[fr], Olivier Kaspar, and Thierry Escaich and based on Hugo\\'s poetry.\\nRemarkably, not only has Hugo\\'s literary production been the source of inspiration for musical works, but also his political writings have received attention from musicians and have been adapted to music. For instance, in 2009, Italian composer Matteo Sommacal was commissioned by Festival \"Bagliori d\\'autore\" and wrote a piece for speaker and chamber ensemble entitled Actes et paroles, with a text elaborated by Chiara Piola Caselli after Victor Hugo\\'s last political speech addressed to the Assemblée législative, \"Sur la Revision de la Constitution\" (18 July 1851),[60] and premiered in Rome on 19 November 2009, in the auditorium of the Institut français, Centre Saint-Louis, French Embassy to the Holy See, by Piccola Accademia degli Specchi featuring the composer Matthias Kadar\\xa0[nl].[61]\\nWhen Hugo returned to Paris in 1870, the country hailed him as a national hero. He was confident that he would be offered the dictatorship, as shown by the notes he kept at the time: \"Dictatorship is a crime. This is a crime I am going to commit,\" but he felt he had to assume that responsibility.[62] Despite his popularity, Hugo lost his bid for re-election to the National Assembly in 1872.\\nThroughout his life Hugo kept believing in unstoppable humanistic progress. In his last public address on 3 August 1879 he prophesied, in an over-optimistic way, \"In the twentieth century war will be dead, the scaffold will be dead, hatred will be dead, frontier boundaries will be dead, dogmas will be dead; man will live.\"[63]\\nWithin a brief period, he suffered a mild stroke, his daughter Adèle was interned in an insane asylum, and his two sons died. (Adèle\\'s biography inspired the movie The Story of Adele H.) His wife Adèle had died in 1868.\\nHis faithful mistress, Juliette Drouet, died in 1883, only two years before his own death. Despite his personal loss, Hugo remained committed to the cause of political change. On 30 January 1876, he was elected to the newly created Senate. This last phase of his political career was considered a failure. Hugo was a maverick and achieved little in the Senate. He suffered a mild stroke on 27 June 1878.[64][65] To honour the fact that he was entering his 80th year, he received one of the greatest tributes to a living writer ever held. The celebrations began on 25 June 1881, when Hugo was presented with a Sèvres vase, the traditional gift for sovereigns. On 27 June, one of the largest parades in French history was held.\\nMarchers stretched from the Avenue d\\'Eylau, where the author was living, down the Champs-Élysées, and all the way to the centre of Paris. The paraders marched for six hours past Hugo as he sat at the window at his house. Every inch and detail of the event was for Hugo; the official guides even wore cornflowers as an allusion to Fantine\\'s song in Les Misérables. On 28 June, the city of Paris changed the name of the Avenue d\\'Eylau to Avenue Victor-Hugo.[66] Letters addressed to the author were from then on labelled \"To Mister Victor Hugo, In his avenue, Paris\". Two days before dying, he left a note with these last words: \"To love is to act.\"\\nOn 20 May 1885, le Petit Journal published the official medical bulletin on Hugo\\'s health condition. \"The illustrious patient\" was fully conscious and aware that there was no hope for him. They also reported from a reliable source that at one point in the night he had whispered the following alexandrin, \"En moi c’est le combat du jour et de la nuit.\"—\"In me, this is the battle between day and night.\"[67] Le Matin published a slightly different version: \"Here is the battle between day and night.\"\\nHugo\\'s death from pneumonia on 22 May 1885, at the age of 83, generated intense national mourning. He was not only revered as a towering figure in literature, he was a statesman who shaped the Third Republic and democracy in France. All his life he remained a defender of liberty, equality and fraternity as well as an adamant champion of French culture. In 1877, aged 75, he wrote, \"I am not one of these sweet-tempered old men. I am still exasperated and violent. I shout and I feel indignant and I cry. Woe to anyone who harms France! I do declare I will die a fanatic patriot.\"[68]\\nAlthough he had requested a pauper\\'s funeral, by decree of President Jules Grévy he was awarded a state funeral, an event described by Nietzsche as a \"veritable orgy of bad taste\".[69] More than two million people joined Hugo\\'s funeral procession in Paris from the Arc de Triomphe to the Panthéon, where he was buried. He shares a crypt within the Panthéon with Alexandre Dumas and Émile Zola. Most large French towns and cities have a street or square named after him.\\nHugo left five sentences as his last will, to be officially published:\\nJe donne cinquante mille francs aux pauvres. Je veux être enterré dans leur corbillard.\\nJe refuse l\\'oraison de toutes les Églises. Je demande une prière à toutes les âmes.\\nJe crois en Dieu.\\nI leave 50,000 francs to the poor. I wish to be buried in their hearse.\\nI refuse [funeral] orations from all Churches. I ask [for] a prayer to all souls.\\nI believe in God.\\nHugo produced more than 4,000 drawings, with about 3,000 drawings still in existence. Originally pursued as a casual hobby, drawing became more important to Hugo shortly before his exile when he made the decision to stop writing to devote himself to politics. Drawing became his exclusive creative outlet between 1848 and 1851.[70][71]\\nHugo worked only on paper, and on a small scale; usually in dark brown or black pen-and-ink wash, sometimes with touches of white, and rarely with colour.[72]\\nHugo married Adèle Foucher in October 1822. Despite their respective affairs, they lived together for nearly 46 years until she died in August 1868. Hugo, who was still banished from France, was unable to attend her funeral in Villequier where their daughter Léopoldine was buried. From 1830 to 1837 Adèle had an affair with Charles-Augustin Sainte Beuve, a reviewer and writer.[73]\\nAdèle and Victor Hugo had their first child, Léopold, in 1823, but the boy died in infancy. On 28 August 1824, the couple\\'s second child, Léopoldine, was born, followed by Charles on 4 November 1826, François-Victor on 28 October 1828, and Adèle on 28 July 1830.\\nHugo\\'s eldest and favourite daughter, Léopoldine, died in 1843 at the age of 19, shortly after her marriage to Charles Vacquerie. On 4 September, she drowned in the Seine at Villequier when the boat she was in overturned. Her young husband died trying to save her. The death left her father devastated; Hugo was travelling at the time, in the south of France, when he first learned about Léopoldine\\'s death from a newspaper that he read in a café.[74]\\nHe describes his shock and grief in his famous poem \"À Villequier\":\\n\\nHélas\\xa0! vers le passé tournant un œil d\\'envie,\\nSans que rien ici-bas puisse m\\'en consoler,\\nJe regarde toujours ce moment de ma vie\\nOù je l\\'ai vue ouvrir son aile et s\\'envoler!\\n\\nJe verrai cet instant jusqu\\'à ce que je meure,\\nL\\'instant, pleurs superflus\\xa0!\\nOù je criai\\xa0: L\\'enfant que j\\'avais tout à l\\'heure,\\nQuoi donc\\xa0! je ne l\\'ai plus\\xa0!\\nAlas! My envious eye, turning toward the past,\\nWithout anything else down here able to console me,\\nI look continually at that moment of my life\\nWhere I saw her spread her wings and fly away!\\n\\nI will see that instant until I die,\\nThat instant, nothing beyond!\\nWhere I cried: \"The child I had a short time ago,\\nWhat! I have her no more!\"\\nHe wrote many poems afterward about his daughter\\'s life and death. His most famous poem is \"Demain, dès l\\'aube\" (Tomorrow, at Dawn), in which he describes visiting her grave.\\nHugo decided to live in exile after Napoleon III\\'s coup d\\'état at the end of 1851. After leaving France, Hugo lived in Brussels briefly in 1851, and then moved to the Channel Islands, first to Jersey (1852–1855) and then to the smaller island of Guernsey in 1855, where he stayed until Napoleon III\\'s fall from power in 1870. Although Napoleon III proclaimed a general amnesty in 1859, under which Hugo could have safely returned to France, the author stayed in exile, only returning when Napoleon III was removed from power by the creation of the French Third Republic in 1870, as a result of the French defeat at the Battle of Sedan in the Franco-Prussian War. After the Siege of Paris from 1870 to 1871, Hugo lived again in Guernsey from 1872 to 1873, and then finally returned to France for the remainder of his life. In 1871, after the death of his son Charles, Hugo took custody of his grandchildren Jeanne and Georges-Victor.\\nFrom February 1833 until her death in 1883, Juliette Drouet devoted her whole life to Victor Hugo, who never married her even after his wife died in 1868. He took her on his numerous trips and she followed him in exile on Guernsey.[75] There Hugo rented a house for her near Hauteville House, his family home. She wrote some 20,000 letters in which she expressed her passion or vented her jealousy on her womanizing lover.[76]\\nOn 25 September 1870 during the Siege of Paris (19 September 1870 – 28 January 1871) Hugo feared the worst. He left his children a note reading as follows:\\n\"J.D.\\nShe saved my life in December 1851. For me she underwent exile. Never has her soul forsaken mine. Let those who have loved me love her. Let those who have loved me respect her.\\nShe is my widow.\"\\nV.H.[77]\\nFor more than seven years, Léonie d’Aunet, who was a married woman, was involved in a love relationship with Hugo. Both were caught in adultery on 5 July 1845. Hugo, who had been a Member of the Chamber of Peers since April, avoided condemnation whereas his mistress had to spend two months in prison and six in a convent. Many years after their separation, Hugo made a point of supporting her financially.[78]\\nHugo gave free rein to his sensuality until a few weeks before his death. He sought a wide variety of women of all ages, be they courtesans, actresses, prostitutes, admirers, servants or revolutionaries like Louise Michel for sexual activity. Both a graphomaniac and erotomaniac, he systematically reported his casual affairs using his own code, as Samuel Pepys did, to make sure they would remain secret. For instance, he resorted to Latin abbreviations (osc. for kisses) or to Spanish (Misma. Mismas cosas: The same. Same things). Homophones are frequent: Seins (Breasts) becomes Saint; Poële (Stove) actually refers to Poils (Pubic hair). Analogy also enabled him to conceal the real meaning: A woman\\'s Suisses (Swiss) are her breasts—because Switzerland is renowned for its milk. After a rendezvous with a young woman named Laetitia he would write Joie (Happiness) in his diary. If he added t.n. (toute nue) he meant she stripped naked in front of him. The initials S.B. discovered in November 1875 may refer to Sarah Bernhardt.[79]\\nVille avec le pont de Tumbledown, (\"Town with Tumbledown Bridge\"), 1847.\\nPieuvre avec les initiales V.H., (\"Octopus with the initials V.H.\"), 1866.\\nLe Rocher de l\\'Ermitage dans un paysage imaginaire (\"Ermitage Rock in an imaginary landscape\")\\nLe phare (\"The Lighthouse\")\\nGavroche à onze ans (\"Gavroche at eleven years old\").\\nVictor Hugo with his son François-Victor by Auguste de Châtillon, 1836.\\nMarble bust of Victor Hugo by Auguste Rodin\\nVictor Hugo by Charles Hugo c. 1853\\nPhotogravure\\nHis legacy has been honored in many ways, including his portrait being placed on French currency.\\nThe people of Guernsey erected a statue by sculptor Jean Boucher in Candie Gardens (Saint Peter Port) to commemorate his stay in the islands.

Allen; Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Averil Ives, Anita Charles, Barbara Rowan, Jane Beaufort, Rose Burghley, Mary Whistler and Marguerite Bell. She has sold millions of copies over her 90-year career. She has been referred to as the \"world\\'s oldest novelist\" who was still active at 105 and continued writing until her death.[2] On the occasion of her 105th birthday, Pollock was appointed honorary vice-president of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association, having been one of its founding members.[3]\\nIda and her husband, Lt Colonel Hugh Alexander Pollock, DSO (1888–1971), a veteran of war and Winston Churchill\\'s collaborator and editor, had a daughter, Rosemary Pollock, who was also a romance writer. Ida\\'s autobiography, Starlight, published in 2009 at 100 years, tells the story of the start of her career, her marriage, and the relation of her husband with his ex-wife Enid Blyton. She was also an oil painter, who was selected for inclusion in a national exhibition in 2004, at the age of 96.[4]\\nBorn Ida Julia Crowe on 12 April 1908 in Lewisham, Kent, England,[5] she was the daughter of Fanny Osborn, whose father was an architect in Victorian London, and her husband Arthur Crowe, but Pollock claimed to be illegitimate.[6] Still unmarried, her mother began an affair with a supposed Russian duke, but, after her parents\\' death, her mother married Arthur Crowe, an old widower with a distant connection to Lord Nelson. A year or so later her mother resumed her affair with her Russian lover and became pregnant, but her daughter obtained her husband\\'s surname.[6] Her mother lived alone when Pollock was born, and she narrowly escaped being smothered with a pillow by the nurse who attended her birth.[7] Her mother had a difficult time raising her and she was almost adopted by a rich uncle.[6] Encouraged by her mother, she began to write while still at school. At 14, she published her first thriller, The Hills of Raven\\'s Haunt.[citation needed]\\nAt age 20, she was living with her mother in Hastings and already had several stories in major magazines and short novels in print.[8] She visited George Newnes\\'s office in London, to sell her first full-length manuscript;[7] Palanquins and Coloured Lanterns, a novel set in 1920s Shanghai.[8] Six months later, she discovered they had mislaid it.[9] After they found it, she returned to London to meet one of its editors, the 39-year-old Hugh Alexander Pollock (1888–1971), a distinguished veteran of World War I. Hugh had been married since 1924 to his second wife, the popular children\\'s writer Enid Blyton, and was divorced from his first wife, Marion Atkinson, with whom he had two sons, William Cecil Alexander (1914–16) and Edward Alistair (1915–69). George Newnes bought her manuscript and contracted with her to write two more novels.[7] She became a full-time writer in the 1930s, writing short stories under pseudonyms. Ida decided to travel alone to Morocco, after suffering a mental breakdown.[7]\\nDuring World War II, Ida worked at a hostel for girls in London during the Blitz; at this time Hugh, who had left publishing to join the Army, was Commandant of a school for Home Guard officers.[10] Hugh had two daughters with Enid Blyton, Gillian Mary (later Baverstock; 1931–2007) and Imogen Mary (later Smallwood; born 1935), but his marriage had difficulties and his wife began a series of affairs. He offered Ida a post as civilian secretary at the Army Training Centre in the Surrey Hills. During a bungled firearms training session on a firing range, Hugh was hit by shrapnel and Ida contacted Enid, who declined to visit her husband because she was busy and hated hospitals.[7]\\nIn 1941, Enid met Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters, a London surgeon with whom she began another relationship, and the marriage had broken down. In May 1942, while Ida was visiting her mother\\'s home in Hastings a bomb destroyed the house. She escaped unhurt, but her mother was in hospital for two weeks.[7] Hugh paid for Ida to stay at Claridges and he said he was divorcing his wife. To get a quick divorce, Hugh blamed himself for adultery at divorce petition. On 26 October 1943 Ida and Hugh were married at London\\'s Guildhall Register Office, six days after Enid\\'s marriage to Darrell Waters. In 1944 they had a daughter Rosemary Pollock who has also become a romance writer. Enid changed the names of their daughters and Hugh did not see them again, although Enid had promised access as part of his taking the blame for the divorce.[citation needed]\\nAfter World War II, George Newnes, Hugh\\'s old firm, decided not to work with him anymore. They also represented Enid Blyton and were not willing to let her go. After this the marriage experienced financial problems and, in 1950, Hugh had to declare bankruptcy while he struggled with alcoholism. Ida decided to write popular contemporary romances and sold her first novel to Mills & Boon in 1952. Being in print with several major international publishers at the same time, she decided to use multiple pseudonyms. In the 1950s she wrote as Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Rose Burghley, and Mary Whistler to Mills & Boon; as Averil Ives and Barbara Rowan to Ward Lock; as Anita Charles to Wright & Brown; and as Jane Beaufort to Collins. In 1964, she published under her married name, Ida Pollock, her first historical novel, The Gentle Masquerade, and after the success of it, Mills and Boon\\'s \"Masquerade\" series of historical romances was launched.[8] Under her last pseudonym, Marguerite Bell, she also wrote historical romances. Most of her novels have been reprinted by Mills & Boon (or Harlequin in the United States).\\nDuring her marriage she travelled widely and lived in many parts of England. It was their daughter\\'s asthma that brought the Pollocks to Cornwall. They also lived in Ireland, France, Italy, Malta and Switzerland, where they successfully obtained a lasting cure for Rosemary\\'s debilitating condition.[7] Hugh died on 8 November 1971 in Malta, where he is buried in the British military cemetery. After her husband\\'s death, Pollock returned with her daughter to England and they lived for several years in Wiltshire, before moving to Lanreath in 1986. In the 1970s she slowed the rhythm of publication, but continued to write. Besides romances, she published – as Barbara Rowan – a suspense novel, and her novel, A Distant Drum (2005), is based around the Battle of Waterloo. She has been referred to as the \"world\\'s oldest novelist\" who was still active at 105.[11] After her death, her medieval story: Sir Faintheart was published in 2015, and there are still at least two unpublished Regency romances pending publication, including The Runaway.[2]  Today many of her old novels are being reedited.\\nIn addition to writing, Ida constructed model houses, usually scale miniatures of Georgian or Tudor buildings.

She carried a notebook with her and would often jot down poems, essays, and short stories.  In her first semester at the University of Florida, Ivory\\'s English professor invited her to join the invitational honors program based on writing ability and told her to consider a career as an author.  While she enjoyed the honors program, Ivory decided that she needed a backup plan.[1]  She earned an undergraduate degree in applied mathematics and a master\\'s degree in theoretical mathematics, and also completed post-graduate work in English at Cambridge University.[2]  She taught math at the junior high and high school level before accepting a position as a professor at the University of Miami.[2]\\nShe began her writing career in earnest when her children were toddlers.[3]  At first, she concentrated on non-fiction articles for parenting magazines.[1]  After finishing her first novel, Starlit Surrender, Ivory sent it to twelve publishing houses.  It sold nine weeks later and was published in 1988 by Zebra.  Ironically, the week the book was published she received a rejection letter for the same book from Pocket Books.[1]\"  Ivory switched publishing houses, to Berkley, for her second novel, Black Silk. Berkley had a backlog of novels by other writers and were unable to schedule her book very quickly, leading to a three-year gap between the novels.  It took another four years before her third book, Bliss, was published.  This time, the gap was due partially to personal event.  In 1992, within a four-month span Ivory\\'s children fell ill with collapsed lungs, her husband filed for divorce, and their home was hit by Hurricane Andrew.  The children recovered, the house was rebuilt, and Ivory has gotten on with her life, but it caused a major delay in the completion of her book.[2]\\nAfter her 1996 release Dance, Ivory left Berkley for a publishing deal with Avon.  Avon requested that she change her name.  Her previous books had been published under her real name, Judy Cuevas.  They hoped that a new marketing campaign under a new name would enable her books to sell in larger quantities because bookstores did not have a preconceived notion of how many books she might be able to sell.  Under Avon\\'s guidance, Ivory has become much more successful, graduating to the super lead position (the second highest level) for their romance line by [1999].[2]\\nIvory has a large family, including her own brother and fifteen aunts and uncles.  Her family is very supportive, to the point that her father has been known to buy all the copies of her latest book at a local bookstore and demand that the owner reorder.  One of Ivory\\'s aunts likes to attend her book signings and tell passersby that Ivory is the best writer alive.[3]\\nIvory is most productive when she devotes a continued amount of time to her work.  She often works eight to ten hours a day, six days a week, with a more abbreviated schedule on Sundays.  After completing a book, she takes a break, often choosing to travel.[1]  Unfortunately, since the mid-2000s back problems have prevented Ivory from completing her latest work in progress, a Victorian-set novel that is potentially the first in a series.[4]\\nIvory has a son and daughter, both of whom are now on their own.  She lives in Miami, Florida.[3]\\nShe has been awarded the Romance Writers of America RITA Award and the Romantic Times Reviewer\\'s Choice Award.[5]\\n',\n",

She wrote the best-selling erotic romance trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, and Fifty Shades Freed,[3][4] along with the companion novels Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian, Darker: Fifty Shades Darker as Told by Christian, and Freed: Fifty Shades Freed as Told by Christian. Prior to this, she wrote the Twilight fan fiction \"Master of the Universe\" that served as the basis for the Fifty Shades trilogy under the web name Snowqueens Icedragon. In 2019 she published her first book unconnected with the fictional world of Fifty Shades, The Mister, to negative critical reaction.[5][6][7]\\nThe Fifty Shades novels have sold over 150\\xa0million copies worldwide, over 35\\xa0million copies in the United States and set the record in the United Kingdom as the fastest selling paperback of all time.[8][9][10][11] In 2012, Time magazine named her one of \"The World\\'s 100 Most Influential People\".[12] The novels were subsequently adapted into the films Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, and Fifty Shades Freed.[13]\\nErika Mitchell was born on 7 March 1963 in Willesden, Middlesex to a Chilean mother and a Scottish father who was a BBC cameraman.[1][14] She was brought up in Buckinghamshire.[1]\\nJames was educated at the independent Pipers Corner School and at Wycombe High School, a state grammar school for girls in the town of High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, followed by the University of Kent in South East England where she studied History.[1]\\nAfter leaving university, James became a studio manager\\'s assistant at the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield. She married Niall Leonard, a novelist and screenwriter from Northern Ireland, in 1987. They have two sons. As of 2012, they reside in Brentford, West London.[1][15]\\nJames says the idea for the Fifty Shades trilogy began as a response to the vampire novel series Twilight. In late 2008, James saw the movie Twilight, and then became intensely absorbed with the novels that the movie was based on. She read the novels several times over in a period of a few days, and then, for the first time in her life, sat down to write a book: basically a sequel to the Twilight novels. Between January and August 2009, she wrote two such books in quick succession. She says she then discovered the phenomenon of fan fiction, and this inspired her to publish her novels as Kindle books under the pen name \"Snowqueens Icedragon\". Beginning in August 2009, she then began to write the Fifty Shades books.[15][16]\\nJames has spoken of her shock at the success of the books. \"The explosion of interest has taken me completely by surprise\" she said.[17] James has described the Fifty Shades trilogy as \"my midlife crisis, writ large. All my fantasies in there, and that\\'s it.\"[18] She did not start to write until January 2009, as she revealed while still active on FanFiction.Net: \"I started writing in January 2009 after I finished the Twilight saga, and I haven\\'t stopped since. I discovered Fan Fiction in August 2009. Since then I have written my two fics and plan on doing at least one more. After that\\xa0... who knows?\"[19]\\nIn August 2013, James topped the Forbes\\' list of the highest-earning authors due to her book sales[20] with earnings of $95m which included $5m for the film rights to Fifty Shades of Grey.[21]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nEloisa James is the pen name of Mary Bly (born 1962). She is a tenured Shakespeare professor at Fordham University who also writes best-selling Regency and Georgian romance novels under her pen name. Her novels are published in 30 countries and have sold approximately 7 million copies worldwide. She also wrote a bestselling memoir about the year her family spent in France, Paris in Love.\\nShe is the daughter of poet Robert Bly and short-story author Carol Bly.[1]\\nMary Bly was born in Minnesota in 1962, the daughter of Robert Bly, winner of the American Book Award for poetry, and Carol Bly, a short story author. She was the inspiration for her mother\\'s essay \"The Maternity Wing, Madison, Minnesota\", which was published in the anthology Imagining Home: Writing From the Midwest.[2] Her godfather, James Wright, wrote a poem for her, which he included in his Pulitzer Prize-winning Collected Poems.[3] She has three younger siblings, Bridget, Noah,[2] and Micah.[4]\\nThe Bly family did not own a television but did own more than 5,000 books. Robert often read to his children, exposing them to classics such as Beowulf.[5] Even at a young age, however, Bly was fascinated with romance. Throughout her childhood, she wrote and produced plays, using her siblings as the cast, and charging admission to any adults in the household (poets came often, visiting her father). The plays always ended in a romance, if only because her sister insisted on being a princess. To entertain her siblings during a snowstorm, she once wrote and built a puppet show, complete with lights, that also featured a romance.[6] After discovering the romance novels of Georgette Heyer in her local library, Bly convinced her father to allow her to read one romance novel for each classic novel she read.[2]\\nAfter graduating from Harvard University, Bly went on to earn an M.Phil. from Oxford University and a Ph.D. in Renaissance studies from Yale University.[citation needed]\\nShe is a tenured professor lecturing on William Shakespeare at Fordham University in New York City. She has served as director of graduate studies in the English Department, as well as head of Fordham\\'s Creative Writing Program and, in 2018 and 2019, associate dean of Fordham College, Lincoln Center.[7] She specializes in bawdy puns found in English boys\\' plays written between 1600-1608.[8] In addition to publishing an academic book with Oxford University Press, she has published an academic article on 17th-century drama in Publications of the Modern Language Association of America.[9]\\nWhile attending the University of Virginia on a humanities fellowship, Bly began writing romance novels. Her second career began when her husband wished to postpone having a second child until they had paid off their student loans. To speed the process, Bly followed her parents\\' examples and wrote a story to send to a publisher.[2] Two publishers bid for that novel, Potent Pleasures,[10] netting Bly an advance that paid off her student loans in full.[2] As she was at the time an untenured professor about to publish her first academic work,[11] Bly made the decision to publish her fiction books under a pseudonym, Eloisa James, to keep her academic life separate from her fiction writing.[12] She has written 30 novels, 27 of which were New York Times bestsellers. Her books have since been translated into 28 languages and 30 countries[13] and have become hardcover bestsellers in the Netherlands and Spain.\\nBly\\'s first three novels, the Pleasures Trilogy, were published in hardcover by Dell, a plan with which Bly did not fully agree. Following the publication of those three novels, she bought out the remainder of her contract and moved to Avon, where her books are now published in mass market paperback format. She believed that marketing her first works as hardcovers was not a truly successful plan and hoped to have more success with the mass-market paperbacks.[14]\\nThe inspiration for her novels comes in part from her academic career, as plays or facts discovered during her academic research often spark ideas for fictional plots.[10] Her novels, which are set in England\\'s Regency period (1811–1820) or Georgian period (1740-1837), often have references to Shakespeare or include pieces of 16th-century poetry or other tidbits she has found while researching her academic papers.[15] As she spends much of her day teaching about or reading early British English, she feels that the language choices she makes in her novels are more authentic.[11] Although Bly has attempted to write a contemporary romance, she chose not to finish the manuscript because of difficulty writing in a contemporary voice.[16]\\nThe characters in Bly\\'s novels often dispense with the typical romance novel stereotypes, with characters that care about religion and a focus on historical accuracy.[17] Her heroines are usually surrounded by very good female friends or sisters. Most of her novels are part of a trilogy or set of four novels that focus on a set of interconnected characters, and explores the relationships between those characters as well as that of the hero and heroine.[18]\\nIn 2018, Apple Books included her novel, Too Wilde to Wed, on its list of 10 Best Books of 2018.[19]\\nFor several years Bly\\'s second career remained a secret, and she disguised herself by wearing contacts instead of her normal glasses when she attended functions as Eloisa James.[5] After her first New York Times bestseller in 2005, Bly realized that her readers liked her writing regardless of its genre, and that by keeping her identity a secret she was implying that she was ashamed of her work and of her readers.[12] At a February 16, 2005, faculty meeting, Bly outed herself to her colleagues, revealing her alter ego and offering copies of her novels to her fellow professors. Once she had officially \"come out\", she submitted an op-ed to The New York Times defending the romance genre. She was invited to speak at the National Book Festival in 2012.[20]\\nBly credits her success in dual careers to being \"very, very organized\".[18] Lacking the time to write every day, Bly often writes upwards of 20 pages at a time.[21] On her days at home, Bly schedules time to work on both her fiction and her academic works. When possible, she does not work when her children are at home.[18] Bly usually does not teach in the summers, giving her more time to devote to her writing (both academic and fiction).[16]\\nBly\\'s father and stepmother, Ruth, are very supportive of her romance writing. Carol Bly also supported her daughter, contributing a \"nifty crossword puzzle\" to the Eloisa James website.[2]\\nBly\\'s mother died from ovarian cancer. Collaborating with her publisher, Avon, an imprint of Harper Collins, she became a spokesperson, along with six other Avon Romance authors, in a program named K.I.S.S. and TEAL to increase awareness about the early symptoms of this disease.[22]\\nBly is married to Alessandro Vettori, an Italian knight (or cavaliere)[15] who is also a professor of Italian at Rutgers University,[12] whom she met on a blind date while she was at Yale.[17] They have a son and a daughter.[23] The family lives primarily in New York[24] but spends summers in Tuscany visiting Alessandro\\'s mother and sister.[3]\\nWilde family tree: https://www.eloisajames.com/extras/the-wilde-family-tree/\\nEssex family tree: https://www.eloisajames.com/extras/essex-sisters-family-tree/\\n',\n",

Its original format of \"soft adult contemporary\" music included artists such as Lionel Richie and Tina Turner. Reflecting this, its early slogan described the station as being \"100.7 degrees cooler\".\\nIts programming format was modified in 1996, a year after Chrysalis launched Heart 106.2 in London. The new format saw the \"soft\" AC music replaced with a generally more neutral Hot AC music playlist. This saw radio audience listening figures grow to equal that of local rival BRMB, which had been the leading commercial radio station in the West Midlands.

She wrote under her first married name and under the pen-names: Denise Chesterton, Eve Vaill, \\'Anne Llewellyn\\', Hervey Hamilton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray and Julia Kane, producing short stories, plays, and about 170 Gothic romance novels. In 1965, Robins published her autobiography, Stranger Than Fiction. At the time of her death in 1985, Robins\\'s books had been translated into fifteen languages and had sold more than one hundred million copies. In 1984, they were borrowed more than one and a half million times from British libraries.[2]\\nShe was the daughter of the novelist K. C. Groom, and mother of romance novelist Patricia Robins. Some other members of her family are well-known artists.\\nRobins was born Denise Naomi Klein on 1 February 1897 in London, England, the daughter of Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell, who was also a prolific author who wrote under several names, and of her first husband, Herman Klein, who was a professor of music and journalist. Of Russian Jewish ancestry, he had been born in Norwich in 1856. Her mother Kathleen Clarice had been born in Melbourne, Australia, on 11 March 1872 and was the daughter of George Cornwell and his wife Jemima Ridpath, married in 1850.[3] George Cornwell was a railway guard who became a successful gold prospector in Australia, operating several mines, and a notable building contractor. His eldest daughter, Alice Cornwell, born 1852, was spectacularly rich by the 1890s, returning to England and buying the Sunday Times newspaper.[4][5]\\nHer parents had married in 1890. He had a daughter Sibyl Klein, from a previous marriage, and they had two sons: Adrian Bernard Klein (1892–1969) and Daryl Klein (1894), before the birth of Denise Naomi Klein (1897–1985). The childhood of Denise, Adrian and Daryl Klein was far from settled. Kathleen Klein began an affair with a Worcestershire Regiment officer called Herbert Berkeley Dealtry, who was much younger than her husband, and little than herself, and when Hermann Klein became aware of it he filed a petition for divorce, which was granted in December 1901. Kathleen then married Dealtry.[4]\\nIn 1905, the Dealtrys had some serious troubles in connection with the promotion of dog shows, which they had been drawn into by Kathleen\\'s sister Alice Stennard Robinson, a leading member of the Ladies\\' Kennel Association (founded 1904) and the National Cat Club. Somehow, the money from the first dog show went missing, and the Dealtrys held a second show to pay the prize money owed on the first. After the second show, prize winners sued Dealtry, which led to his being declared bankrupt.[4] The family then lived in America for a few years but, by 1908, Kathleen (or \\'Kit\\') Dealtry was back in London, writing Christian novels.[6] In 1918 she married for a third time and wrote at least three books[7] as Mrs Sydney Groom.[4]\\nHer eldest brother Adrian Bernard Klein also became a writer, he was an artist and wrote books on photography and cinematography. After serving as an officer in the British Army, he became a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and changed his name to Adrian Cornwell-Clyne.[4]\\nDenise Naomi Klein married firstly Arthur Robins in 1918, a corn broker on the Baltic Exchange,[8] they had three daughters, Eve Louise, Patricia Robins (a.k.a. Claire Lorrimer) who became another best-selling author, and Anne Eleanor.[8] In 1938, the marriage ended in divorce, after Robins met O\\'Neill Pearson in Egypt,[9] they married in 1939. However, like Agatha Christie, Robins continued to publish most of her books under her first married name.[1]\\nWhen she left school, Denise Klein went to work as a journalist for the D. C. Thomson Press, then became a freelance writer. She began to follow in her mother\\'s footsteps when her first novel was published in 1924. Her serial What is Love? ran in The Star from December 1925 to February 1926.[10] Her first play, Heatwave, written in collaboration with Roland Pertwee, was produced at the St James\\'s Theatre, London, in 1929.[11] As a writer of fiction, Denise Klein wrote under a variety of pen-names, including Denise Chesterton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray, Hervey Hamilton and Julia Kane.[1] After marrying Arthur Robins, many of her books were written under her married name.[11]\\nRobins had been writing fiction and getting it published for ten years when in 1927 she met Charles Boon, of Mills & Boon, and she entered her first contract with his firm the same year. Under the terms of this, she was to be paid an advance of thirty pounds for three novels, plus ten per cent terms. Her next contract, for a further six books, delivered an advance of twenty-five pounds for each book, while her third contract, for four more books, paid one hundred pounds for each, plus terms of twelve and a half per cent.[12]\\nThe colourful dust wrappers of Mills & Boon\\'s books were becoming one of their biggest selling points. As an example, the cover of Robins\\'s Women Who Seek (1928) showed a glamorous flapper checking her make-up.[13]\\n\\nRobins became not only Mills & Boon\\'s most prolific writer, but also their best paid. A contract she signed in 1932 paid her £2,400 for eight books, which were those from Shatter the Sky (July 1933) to How Great the Price (June 1935). This was, however, her last work for the firm, as she was then \\'poached\\' by a new publisher, Nicholson & Watson.[14] Of this development, Arthur Boon wrote:[14] Denise Robins, one of our greatest authors, knew she could sell on her name more than other authors could. She was a superstar, and she knew it. Our problem was to find a way to satisfy the superstar. What could Mills & Boon offer a superstar? Superstars weren\\'t grateful.\\nRobins gave her version of events in her autobiography:[11][14] Suddenly a young man named Ivor Nicholson came along – a clever, charming journalist who, with the wealth of Bernard Watson to back his new venture, launched a new publishing house – Ivor Nicholson & Watson. They wanted my name on their list. They tempted me with what was the biggest offer I had ever received from any literary quarter, a cheque for one thousand pounds, free, gratis, and for which I need do no work. It was merely for signing the contract! I did not go behind Charles Boon\\'s back. I told him the facts. Unfortunately he was so annoyed by Ivor Nicholson\\'s offer that he refused to compete and at once released me from my contract with his firm. Somewhat reluctantly I left my old publishers and became the new Nicholson & Watson \\'star\\' author.The first book Robins wrote for Nicholson was Life and Love (1935), which was launched with a huge publicity campaign. Robins\\'s first photo opportunity was a visit to Liverpool to open a new lending library, and the slogan \\'Robins for Romance\\' was posted on London buses.[14]\\nJoseph McAleer has described Robins as \"the recognised mistress of the punishing kiss device.[15]\\nDuring her long career as a writer, from about 1917 until her death in 1985, Robins certainly wrote more than one hundred and sixty books. She was dubbed by the Daily Graphic \"the queen of romantic fiction\".[4]\\nShe was elected as President of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association in 1961.[9]\\nIn 1965, Robins published her autobiography, Stranger Than Fiction, summarised thus: \"Apart from writing nearly two hundred novels that have brought her millions of fans throughout the world, Denise Robins led a remarkable life.

[...] So that first night together was spent in the ancient bedroom with the tiny leaded paned windows, through which shafts of moonlight touched the room with a dreamlike radiance [...] \" —Eleanor Hibbert writing as Victoria Holt in The House of a Thousand Lanterns, 1974[5]\\nHibbert was born Eleanor Alice Burford on 1 September 1906 at 20 Burke Street, Canning Town, now part of the London borough of Newham.[6] She inherited a love of reading from her father, Joseph Burford, a dock labourer. Her mother was Alice Louise Burford, née Tate.\\nWhen she was quite young, bad health forced her to be privately educated at home. At the age of 16 she went to a business college, where she studied shorthand, typewriting, and languages. She then worked for a jeweller in Hatton Garden where she weighed gems and typed. She also worked as a language interpreter in a café for French and German-speaking tourists.[4]\\nIn her early twenties she married George Percival Hibbert (c. 1886–1966),[2][7] a wholesale leather merchant about twenty years older than herself, who shared her love of books and reading.[6] She was his second wife.[8] During World War II, the Hibberts lived in a cottage in Cornwall that looked out over a bay called Plaidy Beach.\\nBetween 1974 and 1978, Eleanor Hibbert bought a 13th-century manor house in Sandwich, Kent, that she named King\\'s Lodging because she believed that it had served previously as lodging for English monarchs Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.[7] The house had carved fireplaces and a staircase from the Tudor period.[9] Hibbert restored the house and furnished it opulently but soon found it too big for her taste and too far from London.[6]\\nShe then moved to a two-storey penthouse apartment at Albert Court, Kensington Gore, London, that overlooked the Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park.[4] She shared her apartment with Mrs. Molly Pascoe, a companion who also travelled with her.[10]\\nIn 1985, Hibbert sold King\\'s Lodging.[9][11]\\nHibbert spent her summers in her cottage near Plaidy Beach in Cornwall.[10] To get away from the cold English winter, Hibbert would sail around the world on board a cruise ship three months a year from January to April. The cruise would take her to exotic destinations like Egypt and Australia, locations that she later incorporated into her novels.[10][12] She sailed to Sydney aboard the cruise ship Oronsay in 1970, and the Canberra in 1978.[7]\\nTowards the end of her life, her eyesight started failing.[8]\\nEleanor Hibbert died on 18 January 1993 on the cruise ship Sea Princess somewhere between Athens, Greece and Port Said, Egypt and was buried at sea. A memorial service was later held on 6 March 1993, at St Peter\\'s Anglican Church, Kensington Park Road, London.[6]\\n\"When I was 14 and living in London, I\\'d go around Hampton Court Palace with its marvellous atmosphere, through the gateway where Anne Boleyn walked, the haunted gallery down which Katherine Howard ran. It all set me going, it all started from there.\" —Eleanor Hibbert[13]\\nEleanor Hibbert grew up in London. She first discovered her fascination for the past when she visited Hampton Court in her teenage years.[14] After her marriage, Hibbert achieved the financial independence she needed to realise her desire to write. London\\'s monuments and royal personalities filled Hibbert\\'s historical novels. She was also influenced by her regular visits to British historic homes and their architecture.[15]\\n\"I\\'ll sit in a room and think \\'This is where Charles I was when he was on the run.\\' I feel the atmosphere all around me, and that\\'s what I write about.\" —Eleanor Hibbert[15]\\nDuring World War II, the Hibberts lived in Cornwall, whose pebble beaches, high cliffs and treacherous blue waters served as the setting for many of the Victoria Holt gothic novels.[16]\\nIn later life, Hibbert took a world cruise every year.[7] Her ship called in ports of countries like Turkey, Egypt, India, South Africa, Hong Kong, Ceylon and Australia. These exotic destinations serve as the backdrop in later Victoria Holt novels. In the late 1960s, Hibbert spent two months visiting the Australian goldfields 40 miles north of Melbourne, research for her 1971 Victoria Holt novel, The Shadow of the Lynx.[17] In 1972, Hibbert travelled from Sydney to Melbourne via the Snowy Mountains and visited Hobart, Launceston, Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo.[10][12]\\n\"I love my work so much that nothing would stop me writing. I never think of the money I\\'m making. When I finish one book I start on the next. If I take even a week\\'s break I just feel miserable. It\\'s like a drug. —Eleanor Hibbert[10]\\n\"If anybody says to me \\'you look tired,\\' it\\'s because I haven\\'t been able to get at my typewriter. Writing excites me. I live all my characters and never have any trouble thinking of plots of how people would have said something because I\\'m them when I\\'m writing. —Eleanor Hibbert[9]\\nHibbert\\'s Philippa Carr novels were based partly in Cornwall and partly in Australia.\\nHibbert was influenced in her writing by the Brontës (especially the novel Jane Eyre), George Eliot, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, and Leo Tolstoy.[4]\\nDuring the 1930s, Hibbert wrote nine long novels (each about 150,000 words in length), all of them serious psychological studies of contemporary life.[18] However, none of these were accepted for publication. At the same time, she wrote short stories for newspapers including the Daily Mail and Evening News. Some also appeared in The Star, Woman\\'s Realm and Ladies\\' Home Journal. The turning point came when the fiction editor of the Daily Mail told her, \"You\\'re barking up the wrong tree: you must write something which is saleable, and the easiest way is to write romantic fiction.\"\\nHibbert read 50 romance novels as research and then published her first fiction book, Daughter of Anna, in 1941.[19] It was a period novel set in Australia of the late 18th and 19th centuries. It was a moderate success and Hibbert received £30 as advance for it. The book was published under her maiden name, Eleanor Burford, which was also used for her contemporary novels. Following the success of the book, Hibbert was contracted by Herbert Jenkins publishers to write one book a year. By 1961 Hibbert had published 31 novels under this name, including ten romance novels for Mills & Boon.\\nIn 1945, she chose the pseudonym Jean Plaidy for her new novel Together They Ride at the request of her agent.[14] The name was inspired by Plaidy Beach near the Hibberts\\' home in Looe, Cornwall during World War II.[16] Her agent suggested the first name, saying \"Jean doesn\\'t take much room at the back of the book\".[14] The book was published by Gerald G. Swan, a London publisher.[4] The next book written under the Jean Plaidy pseudonym was Beyond the Blue Mountains in 1948. The publisher Robert Hale accepted the 500-page manuscript after it had been rejected by several others. The firm wrote to Hibbert\\'s literary agency, A.M. Heath, \"Will you tell this author that there are glittering prizes ahead for those who can write as she does?\".[8] In 1949, Hibbert hit her stride with the first Jean Plaidy novel that fictionalized stories of royalty: The King\\'s Pleasure, featuring Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.[20] A total of 91 Jean Plaidy novels were published. Hibbert\\'s last Jean Plaidy book, The Rose Without a Thorn, was published posthumously.[4]\\nHibbert also wrote four non-fiction books under the pseudonym Jean Plaidy. The first, A Triptych of Poisoners (1958), was a collection of short biographies of poisoners: Cesare Borgia, Marie d\\'Aubray and Edward William Pritchard. The other three were a trilogy on the Spanish Inquisition: The Rise (1959), The Growth (1960) and The End (1961).\\nFrom 1950 to 1953, Hibbert wrote four novels as Elbur Ford, a pen name derived from her maiden name, Eleanor Burford. These novels were based on real-life murderers of the nineteenth century:  Edward William Pritchard (Flesh and the Devil, 1950); Adelaide Bartlett (Poison in Pimlico, 1950); Euphrasie Mercier[21] (The Bed Disturbed, 1952) and Constance Kent (Such Bitter Business, 1953 – published in the U.S. in 1954 under the title Evil in the House).\\nBetween 1952 and 1960, Hibbert used the pseudonym Kathleen Kellow to write eight novels that were mostly crime and mystery fiction. From 1956 to 1961, she wrote five novels as Ellalice Tate, a pseudonym inspired by her mother\\'s name, Alice Tate.[22]\\n\"I\\'ve always wanted to write a best-seller. Every writer does. It\\'s really a matter of finding out what the public wants. —Eleanor Hibbert[18]\\nIn 1960, at the suggestion of her agent, Patricia Schartle Myrer, she wrote her first Gothic romance, Mistress of Mellyn, under the name Victoria Holt. The pseudonym was created by choosing the name Victoria for its regal, romantic ring while the name Holt was taken from the military bank of Holt & Company where Hibbert had an account.[18][23] Published by Doubleday in the United States and Collins in the United Kingdom, Mistress of Mellyn became an instant international bestseller and revived the Gothic romantic suspense genre.[2][8][24][25]\\n\"I have heard her name mentioned in connection with mine and I think it is because we both lived in Cornwall and have written about this place. Rebecca is the atmospheric suspense type of book mine are. But I don’t think there is much similarity between her others and mine.\" —Daphne du Maurier commenting on the similarity between Victoria Holt\\'s novels and her own.[9]\\nMistress of Mellyn was a clever weaving of elements from earlier Gothic novels such as Jane Eyre (1847), The Woman in White (1859), and Rebecca (1938). Its setting in Cornwall made the resemblance to Rebecca (1938) so remarkable that it was speculated that Victoria Holt was a pseudonym for Daphne du Maurier.[15][26] After six Victoria Holt novels were published over eight years, it was revealed that Hibbert was the author.[9] Hibbert wrote a further 31 novels as Victoria Holt, primarily portraying fictitious characters set against an authentic period background, usually of the late 19th century. The last Victoria Holt novel, The Black Opal, was published after her death.[8]\\nIn 1960, Hibbert wrote a novel under the name Anna Percival, a pseudonym inspired by her husband\\'s middle name, Percival. Hibbert never used that pen name again.\\nShe created her last pseudonym, Philippa Carr, in 1972 at the suggestion of her publisher, Collins, to create a new series showing successive generations of English gentlewomen involved in important historical events starting with the Reformation and ending with World War II.[8]\\nHibbert continued to use the pseudonym Jean Plaidy for her historical novels about the crowned heads of Europe. Her books written under this pseudonym were popular with the general public and were also hailed by critics and historians for their historical accuracy, quality of writing, and attention to detail.[27]\\nNumber of books written per decade under different pseudonyms\\nHibbert based her research on the writings of British historians such as John Speed, James Anthony Froude, Alexander Fraser Tytler and Agnes Strickland.[4]\\nEach of Hibbert\\'s Jean Plaidy books featured a bibliography at the end, listing the historical works consulted during the process of writing the book.[28]\\nThe Kensington Central Library gave Hibbert special concessions to aid her research. She was allowed to go down to the vault where the out-of-circulation books were stored, and borrow them a trolley-load at a time.[10] She was even allowed to take the books home and keep them as long as she wanted.[9]\\nWhen her eyesight started failing towards the end of her life, she borrowed audiobooks from the Westminster City Council public libraries.[8]\\nHibbert was a prolific writer, churning out multiple books in a year under different pseudonyms, chiefly Jean Plaidy, Victoria Holt and Philippa Carr.[29][30] Jean Plaidy proved very popular in the United Kingdom, selling large quantities in paperback while Victoria Holt was a bestseller in the United States. Many of her readers never realized that behind all these pen names was a single author.[31][32][33]\\nHibbert attributed her large output to her regular working habits. She described herself as a compulsive writer and would write all seven days in the week. She started every morning at the typewriter on her desk, usually completing five thousand words by lunchtime.[19] Though writing stimulated her, she found the typewriter to be a physical strain. She devoted five hours every day to her writing, in addition to the time that it took her to proof-read her draft and conduct research. In the afternoon, she would personally answer all the fan mail she received. She would also spend time at Kensington Central Library. In the evening, she played chess if she could find an opponent or attended social engagements.[14]\\nEven while on her annual cruise around the world, Hibbert maintained her discipline. She wrote in the mornings, played chess in the afternoons, and joined in the shipboard entertainments in the evenings. She preferred to work on her Victoria Holt novels while on board the cruise ship because they did not require as much research or fact-checking at a library.[12]\\nEleanor Hibbert enjoyed healthy, lifelong relationships with her literary agents and publishers, a rare feat in the publishing world.[8] She was represented in the United Kingdom by A.M. Heath Literary Agency and by McIntosh & Otis in the United States. Her long-time American agent was Patricia Schartle Myrer followed by Julie Fallowfield.\\nLondon publisher Herbert Jenkins published 20 light romantic novels from 1941 to 1955 that Hibbert wrote under the pen name Eleanor Burford. The contract, initially for one book a year at an advance of £30 a title, was later revised to two books a year when the books proved successful.[4]\\nMills and Boon, a London publisher that specialised in low-priced, paperback, romantic novels brought out 10 romance novels from 1956 to 1962 that Hibbert wrote under the pen name Eleanor Burford.\\nGerald G Swan published the first Jean Plaidy book in 1945 but every one after that was published by Robert Hale. Starting with Beyond the Blue Mountains (1948) and extending over the entire course of her lifetime, Robert Hale published a total of 90 Jean Plaidy books in hardcover with dust jackets illustrated by specialist artist Philip Gough.[4]\\nMacRae Smith Co. of Philadelphia published Jean Plaidy titles in the United States. Foreign language editions of Jean Plaidy books began appearing in 1956: in French by Éditions Robert Laffont, Paris; in Spanish by Guillermo Kraft Limitada, Buenos Aires; and in Dutch by Uitgeverij A.J. Luitingh, Amsterdam.\\nIn 1951, Canadian paperback publishers Harlequin reprinted Jean Plaidy\\'s Beyond the Blue Mountains in paperback to achieve their greatest commercial success to that date: of the 30,000 copies sold, only 48 were returned.[34]\\nRobert Hale published eight Kathleen Kellow crime and mystery novels between 1952 and 1960 in hardcover with dust jackets by Philip Gough. Robert Hale also published the sole book written under the Anna Percival pseudonym, The Brides of Lanlory.[4]\\nFrom 1950 to 1953, four Elbur Ford crime novels were published by London publisher William Morrow in the United Kingdom and New York publisher Werner Laurie in the United States.\\nFrom 1956 to 1961, Hodder & Stoughton published all five historical novels written under the pseudonym Ellalice Tate.[4]\\nFrom 1960 to 1993, Hibbert wrote 32 Victoria Holt novels for the publishing giants Collins in the United Kingdom and Doubleday in the United States. Many of them were bestsellers and were translated into 20 languages to reach a worldwide audience.\\nFrom 1972 to 1993, Hibbert wrote 19 Philippa Carr novels that were published by Collins in the United Kingdom and Putnam in the United States. A few of them were later translated into foreign languages such as Spanish, Finnish, Russian and Polish.\\nBy the time of her death in 1993, Hibbert had sold 75 million books translated in 20 languages under the name Victoria Holt, 14 million under the name Jean Plaidy and 3 million under the name Philippa Carr.[2][35]\\nAfter her death, Mark Hamilton of the A.M. Heath Literary Agency took over as executor for her literary estate, estimated to be worth about £8,790,807 at probate.[6][36]\\nThe book The Love Child published in 1950 by Eleanor Burford must not be mistaken for the same-titled novel by Philippa Carr published in 1978 as part of the Daughters of England Series.[37]\\nMany Jean Plaidy books were published under different titles in the United States. Her trilogies were also later re-published as single books, often under different titles than those shown.\\nJean Plaidy historical novels were welcomed by readers who found them to be an easy way to gain insight into a sweeping panorama of European history.\\nIt was common for school girls in England to read these in history lessons, whilst hiding them behind their proper text books.\\nIn the last decade of the 20th century, historical fiction went out of fashion. Jean Plaidy titles went out of print.\\nIn October 2001, Rachel Kahan, associate editor at Crown Publishing Group, and Jean Plaidy fan since childhood, discovered that Jean Plaidy books had gone out of print in the United States.\\n\"I felt awful – like when you learn that an old friend who you haven\\'t seen for many years has suddenly died. But in this case, I was not just a fan mourning the loss of all those great novels, I was actually in a position to do something about it.\" —Rachel Kahan, on discovering in 2003 that Jean Plaidy books had gone out of print in the United States.[20]\\nKahan bought the reprint rights to ten Jean Plaidy novels. In April 2003, Crown chose to publish two books under the Three Rivers Press imprint, both featuring Henry VIII. The Lady in the Tower and The Rose Without a Thorn tell the story of two of his six wives, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, both of whom were beheaded. The books were published in paperback with new titles, modern covers and a readers\\' guide at the back. The first printing of 30,000 copies of each book sold out in 3 months. Based on this success, Crown\\'s United Kingdom unit, Arrow Books, bought the entire Jean Plaidy backlist.[38]\\nIn the Spring of 2003 Three Rivers Press, an imprint of U.S.A. publisher Crown Publishing Group, started republishing Jean Plaidy\\'s stories.[39][40] Three Rivers Press published some of the books with new titles which are listed here:\\nSome of these novels were re-published under the Jean Plaidy name.\\nAll these novels were later re-published under the Jean Plaidy name.\\nVictoria Holt books proved popular with the reading public and many of them made it to bestseller lists. Hibbert won loyalty from large numbers of women readers who passed along their copies to the next generation of women in their family. Hibbert described her heroines as \"women of integrity and strong character\" who were \"struggling for liberation, fighting for their own survival.\"\\n\"A Victoria Holt book is the sort of story to bring despair to literary critics, and rage to supporters of Women\\'s Lib though it would give a great deal of pleasurable entertainment to vast numbers of ordinary women all over the world.\" – a critic[13]\\nHer 1960 novel Mistress of Mellyn single-handedly revived the Gothic romance genre.[15] Many women started writing their own gothic romances. Even male authors like Tom E. Huff and Julian Fellowes succumbed to the trend and wrote romances under female pseudonyms.[42][43][44][45]\\nVictoria Holt novels became best-sellers. In 1970, when gothic mania was at its peak, The Secret Woman became one of the top 10 best-selling books in the United States.[46] By 1975, a Victoria Holt paperback began with a first printing of 800,000 copies.[47]\\nBy the early 1970s gothic novels outsold all other genres in paperback fiction, including mysteries, science fiction and Westerns. This coincided with consolidation within the publishing industry where paperbacks and hardcover publishers were brought together under the same corporate parent for the first time. More sophisticated marketing efforts led to placement in grocery and drugstore checkout aisles, where they found their target audience: educated, middle-class women with a reading habit.[48]\\nHibbert\\'s romance novels were clean; at the most the main characters exchanged smouldering looks of longing. However, by 1969 the sexual revolution had made explicit description more acceptable. In April 1972, the romance novel The Flame and the Flower took advantage of this change in trend and revolutionized the historical romance genre by detailing physical intimacy between the protagonists. Another such novel, Sweet Savage Love, that followed in 1974 cemented the trend. A new genre was thus born, dubbed the \\'sweet savage romance\\' or the \\'bodice ripper\\' because of the heaving, partly exposed bosom often pictured on the cover.[49][50]\\nInterest in Hibbert\\'s clean romances declined. In 1976, a critic complained that Victoria Holt\\'s heroines \"must be a little bit dumb or they won\\'t get themselves into such improbable messes in the first place.\"[51] The next Victoria Holt novel, The Devil on Horseback (1977), was described as \"from another era, sort of out of step with today\\'s style.\"[52] Critics judged the books as falling \"short of her previous standards.\"[53]\\n\"Today\\'s novels are \\'bodice rippers\\' and about as pure as driven slush.\" – a book critic in 1982[54]\\n\"In these books, innocent young virgins are carried off unwillingly by sensual, often primitive older men to picturesque lairs: by pirates to their galleons, Arabs to their harems, Indians to their tepees, knights to their castles. Early in the plot, the woman is ravished against her will and there is sex throughout the story.\" – a book critic describing the \\'bodice-ripper\\' type of romance novel in 1985[55]\\nBy the early 1980s, Gothic romances were no longer as popular as a decade earlier. Readers demanded more sex and adventure in their romance novels. Publishers created paperback imprints like Silhouette and Candlelight Ecstasy simply to satisfy the enormous demand for \"bodice rippers\" and \"hot historicals\".[54][56]\\nBowing to the changing times, Hibbert wrote The Demon Lover, a 1982 Victoria Holt novel, in a style that borrowed several elements from the plot of Sweet Savage Love: forced seduction of a naive girl by a powerful man ending in marriage, set against a background of turmoil in war time. Critics congratulated the move: \"Her latest, \\'The Demon Lover\\', is a straight romance with sexual passion, which is currently \\'in\\'. It has no suspense: the thrilling twists and turns of plot that marked her Gothic novels are no more.\"[57]\\nVictoria Holt\\'s heroines left the decorous drawing rooms of Victorian England to find adventure in far more exotic locations: inside an Egyptian pyramid (The Curse of the Kings, 1973); among Chinese antiques in Hong Kong (The House of a Thousand Lanterns, 1974);[58] down the opal mines of Australia (The Pride of the Peacock, 1976); on a tea plantation in Ceylon (The Spring of the Tiger, 1979);[59] among lush, tropical islands off the coast of Australia (The Road to Paradise Island, 1985);[60] in Crimea with Florence Nightingale (Secret for a Nightingale, 1986); in mutiny-filled British India (The India Fan, 1988); in a Turkish nobleman\\'s harem in Constantinople (The Captive, 1989);[61] in the British colonies of South Africa (Snare of Serpents, 1990); and on a shipwreck in the South Sea Islands (The Black Opal, 1993).\\nIn 1993, Hibbert died. In the closing years of the 20th century, Victoria Holt titles were made available in large print, audiobook and Braille formats. Translations in several European languages, Russian, Hebrew, Persian, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese also appeared.\\n\"Never regret. If it\\'s good, it\\'s wonderful. If it\\'s bad, it\\'s experience.\" —Eleanor Hibbert writing as Victoria Holt in The Black Opal, 1993.[62]\\nIn 2006, London publisher Harper reprinted four of Victoria Holt\\'s most popular titles with new covers: Mistress of Mellyn (1961), The Shivering Sands (1969), The Shadow of the Lynx (1971) and The Time of the Hunter\\'s Moon (1983). Foreign language translations in European languages, Japanese, Sinhalese and Thai were also published that year.\\n',\n",
       " 'Carla Sue Kelly (born 1947) is an American writer in the Regency romance genre. She is the author of over forty books and short stories. Her books are what romance readers call \"keepers,\" i.e. books they keep in their private collections, and accordingly they can be hard to find. Renowned for what she calls \"dukeless\" regencies, her stories often revolve around ordinary people solving their own problems. While many Regency romances feature soldiers returned from the Napoleonic Wars, several of Kelly\\'s books include soldiers and sailors actively involved in the Peninsular campaign and in the naval blockade that prevented France from invading England, bringing this war to life in an unforgettable way. However, her regencies only reflect a part of her writing interests. She also has a strong interest in the American West, which is reflected in her earliest published works and in her non-fiction. Since 2011, Kelly, who has a Mormon background,[1] has written four historical romance novels that focus on the lives of young Mormon women: Borrowed Light, Enduring Light, My Loving Vigil Keeping, and Safe Passage.\\nBorn in 1947, Carla Sue Kelly calls herself a navy brat. The daughter of a Navy Officer, she grew up overseas or on one coast of the United States or the other. She graduated from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah where she studied Latin American history. She completed a master\\'s degree at the University of Louisiana-Monroe, in American history, with a focus on the Civil War and Indian Wars.\\nIn her varied professional career Kelly has worked as a ranger/historian with the National Park Service at Fort Laramie National Historic Site, and a ranger at Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site; a contract research historian for the State Historical Society of North Dakota and history instructor at university level. Kelly is a former staff features writer for the Valley City Times Record newspaper based in Valley City, North Dakota.\\nKelly lives in Idaho Falls, Idaho. She is married to Martin Kelly, former Director of Theatre at Valley City State University, in Valley City, North Dakota, who is now retired. The couple has five grown children now located in various parts of America.\\nWhen interviewed by Lola Sparks in Purple Pens, Kelly identified the following writers as having influenced her:\\nIn her author profile on the e-Harlequin site, Kelly says her three favorite fictional works have remained constant through the years, although their rankings tend to shift: War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, The Lawrenceville Stories by Owen Johnson, and A Town Like Alice by Nevil Shute. Her favorite historical works are One Vast Winter Count, On the Border with Mackenzie, and Crossing the Line. Her favorite crime fiction authors are Michael Connelly, John Harvey, and Peter Robinson.\\nKelly began writing Regency Romances because of her interest in the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815). A major theme in her books is how war touches the lives of ordinary people. In surviving the effects of war and in helping other survivors her characters find in themselves qualities of strength and purpose not previously evident. They are quiet achievers influencing the world on small, personal stages, making a difference in their own lives and others ultimately by acts of kindness rather than daring. Kelly goes against the norms of the genre by focusing her attention not on the glittering world of London society and the social elite, but on the other 99.9% of the population occupying England. Her stories are distinguished by authentic, well-researched detail and lightened by a ready sense of humour.\\nKelly has also written an acclaimed series of short stories about the men, women and children of Fort Laramie during the Indian Wars era of American history. In 2003 her entire collection of Indian War stories was re-published in Here\\'s to the Ladies: Stories from the Frontier Army. Two of these stories A Season for Heroes and Kathleen Flaherty\\'s Long Winter were awarded Spur Awards from the Western Writers of America.\\nAdditionally, in 2022, her 2011 novel Borrowed Light was placed on the AML 100 Works of Significant Mormon Literature.\\nThis list excludes articles written in her capacity of journalist or feature writer for various newspapers and magazines, primarily in North Dakota.\\n',\n",

A child actress and model, she was a repertory cast member of CBS Radio\\'s The March of Time, and appeared in several films in the late 1920s. She became a leading lady upon returning to the screen in the late 1930s, while still in her teens, and made two dozen movies between 1938 and 1946, including portraying Tyrone Power\\'s love interest in the classic Jesse James (1939), which also featured Henry Fonda, and playing opposite Spencer Tracy in Stanley and Livingstone, later that same year. After turning to the stage in the late 1940s, she had her greatest success in a character role, the distraught mother in The Bad Seed, receiving a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for the 1955 stage production and an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress for the 1956 film adaptation, her last film role. Kelly then worked regularly in television until 1963, then took over the role of Martha in the original Broadway production of Who\\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? for several months. She returned to television for a handful of appearances in the mid-1970s.\\nOf Irish descent,[1] Kelly was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, into a theatrical family. Her mother was silent film actress Nan Kelly, who coached her and managed her career. As a child actress, Kelly appeared in 52 films made on the East Coast by the age of 17.[2] Her younger brother was actor Jack Kelly,[3] most noted for playing the role of Bart Maverick, one of the leads (alongside James Garner, Roger Moore or Robert Colbert) in the ABC television series Maverick (1957-1962). The Kelly siblings, who resembled each other, are not currently known to have worked together in film or television.[citation needed]\\nKelly was educated at Bentley School for Girls, Immaculate Conception Academy, and Saint Lawrence Academy.[4]\\nAs a child model, her image had appeared in so many different advertisements by the time she was nine years old that Film Daily commented, \"Nancy has been referred to as \\'the most photographed child in America,\\' largely because of her commercial posing.\"[5]\\nKelly worked extensively in radio in her adolescent years. She played Dorothy Gale in a 1933–34 NBC Radio Network show, The Wizard of Oz, based on The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.[6][7] Kelly was the first ingenue on CBS Radio\\'s The March of Time series, with a vocal versatility that made it possible for her to portray male parts as well as female.[2] She also portrayed Eleanor Roosevelt.[8]:\\u200a434\\u200a\\nAs an adult, Nancy Kelly was a leading lady in 27 movies in the 1930s and \\'40s, including director John Ford\\'s Submarine Patrol (1938) with Preston Foster, Frontier Marshal (1939) with Randolph Scott as Wyatt Earp, Jesse James (1939) with Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda, Stanley and Livingstone (1939) with Spencer Tracy, the comedy He Married His Wife (1940) with Joel McCrea, Parachute Battalion (1941) with Robert Preston, Edmond O\\'Brien, Harry Carey, and Buddy Ebsen, and Tarzan\\'s Desert Mystery (1943) with Johnny Weissmuller.

Allen; Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Averil Ives, Anita Charles, Barbara Rowan, Jane Beaufort, Rose Burghley, Mary Whistler and Marguerite Bell. She has sold millions of copies over her 90-year career. She has been referred to as the \"world\\'s oldest novelist\" who was still active at 105 and continued writing until her death.[2] On the occasion of her 105th birthday, Pollock was appointed honorary vice-president of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association, having been one of its founding members.[3]\\nIda and her husband, Lt Colonel Hugh Alexander Pollock, DSO (1888–1971), a veteran of war and Winston Churchill\\'s collaborator and editor, had a daughter, Rosemary Pollock, who was also a romance writer. Ida\\'s autobiography, Starlight, published in 2009 at 100 years, tells the story of the start of her career, her marriage, and the relation of her husband with his ex-wife Enid Blyton. She was also an oil painter, who was selected for inclusion in a national exhibition in 2004, at the age of 96.[4]\\nBorn Ida Julia Crowe on 12 April 1908 in Lewisham, Kent, England,[5] she was the daughter of Fanny Osborn, whose father was an architect in Victorian London, and her husband Arthur Crowe, but Pollock claimed to be illegitimate.[6] Still unmarried, her mother began an affair with a supposed Russian duke, but, after her parents\\' death, her mother married Arthur Crowe, an old widower with a distant connection to Lord Nelson. A year or so later her mother resumed her affair with her Russian lover and became pregnant, but her daughter obtained her husband\\'s surname.[6] Her mother lived alone when Pollock was born, and she narrowly escaped being smothered with a pillow by the nurse who attended her birth.[7] Her mother had a difficult time raising her and she was almost adopted by a rich uncle.[6] Encouraged by her mother, she began to write while still at school. At 14, she published her first thriller, The Hills of Raven\\'s Haunt.[citation needed]\\nAt age 20, she was living with her mother in Hastings and already had several stories in major magazines and short novels in print.[8] She visited George Newnes\\'s office in London, to sell her first full-length manuscript;[7] Palanquins and Coloured Lanterns, a novel set in 1920s Shanghai.[8] Six months later, she discovered they had mislaid it.[9] After they found it, she returned to London to meet one of its editors, the 39-year-old Hugh Alexander Pollock (1888–1971), a distinguished veteran of World War I. Hugh had been married since 1924 to his second wife, the popular children\\'s writer Enid Blyton, and was divorced from his first wife, Marion Atkinson, with whom he had two sons, William Cecil Alexander (1914–16) and Edward Alistair (1915–69). George Newnes bought her manuscript and contracted with her to write two more novels.[7] She became a full-time writer in the 1930s, writing short stories under pseudonyms. Ida decided to travel alone to Morocco, after suffering a mental breakdown.[7]\\nDuring World War II, Ida worked at a hostel for girls in London during the Blitz; at this time Hugh, who had left publishing to join the Army, was Commandant of a school for Home Guard officers.[10] Hugh had two daughters with Enid Blyton, Gillian Mary (later Baverstock; 1931–2007) and Imogen Mary (later Smallwood; born 1935), but his marriage had difficulties and his wife began a series of affairs. He offered Ida a post as civilian secretary at the Army Training Centre in the Surrey Hills. During a bungled firearms training session on a firing range, Hugh was hit by shrapnel and Ida contacted Enid, who declined to visit her husband because she was busy and hated hospitals.[7]\\nIn 1941, Enid met Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters, a London surgeon with whom she began another relationship, and the marriage had broken down. In May 1942, while Ida was visiting her mother\\'s home in Hastings a bomb destroyed the house. She escaped unhurt, but her mother was in hospital for two weeks.[7] Hugh paid for Ida to stay at Claridges and he said he was divorcing his wife. To get a quick divorce, Hugh blamed himself for adultery at divorce petition. On 26 October 1943 Ida and Hugh were married at London\\'s Guildhall Register Office, six days after Enid\\'s marriage to Darrell Waters. In 1944 they had a daughter Rosemary Pollock who has also become a romance writer. Enid changed the names of their daughters and Hugh did not see them again, although Enid had promised access as part of his taking the blame for the divorce.[citation needed]\\nAfter World War II, George Newnes, Hugh\\'s old firm, decided not to work with him anymore. They also represented Enid Blyton and were not willing to let her go. After this the marriage experienced financial problems and, in 1950, Hugh had to declare bankruptcy while he struggled with alcoholism. Ida decided to write popular contemporary romances and sold her first novel to Mills & Boon in 1952. Being in print with several major international publishers at the same time, she decided to use multiple pseudonyms. In the 1950s she wrote as Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Rose Burghley, and Mary Whistler to Mills & Boon; as Averil Ives and Barbara Rowan to Ward Lock; as Anita Charles to Wright & Brown; and as Jane Beaufort to Collins. In 1964, she published under her married name, Ida Pollock, her first historical novel, The Gentle Masquerade, and after the success of it, Mills and Boon\\'s \"Masquerade\" series of historical romances was launched.[8] Under her last pseudonym, Marguerite Bell, she also wrote historical romances. Most of her novels have been reprinted by Mills & Boon (or Harlequin in the United States).\\nDuring her marriage she travelled widely and lived in many parts of England. It was their daughter\\'s asthma that brought the Pollocks to Cornwall. They also lived in Ireland, France, Italy, Malta and Switzerland, where they successfully obtained a lasting cure for Rosemary\\'s debilitating condition.[7] Hugh died on 8 November 1971 in Malta, where he is buried in the British military cemetery. After her husband\\'s death, Pollock returned with her daughter to England and they lived for several years in Wiltshire, before moving to Lanreath in 1986. In the 1970s she slowed the rhythm of publication, but continued to write. Besides romances, she published – as Barbara Rowan – a suspense novel, and her novel, A Distant Drum (2005), is based around the Battle of Waterloo. She has been referred to as the \"world\\'s oldest novelist\" who was still active at 105.[11] After her death, her medieval story: Sir Faintheart was published in 2015, and there are still at least two unpublished Regency romances pending publication, including The Runaway.[2]  Today many of her old novels are being reedited.\\nIn addition to writing, Ida constructed model houses, usually scale miniatures of Georgian or Tudor buildings. She was also an oil painter, who was selected for inclusion in a national exhibition in 2004, at the age of 96.[8] But her sight deteriorated and she returned to writing.\\nAfter her 100th birthday, her autobiography, Starlight, was published on 15 November 2009, and she tells the story of the start of her career, her marriage, and the relation of her husband with his ex-wife Enid Blyton.\\nIn 1960 she was a founding member of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association, and in 2010 she helped in its 50th anniversary.[7] On the occasion of her 105th birthday, she was appointed its honorary vice-president.\\nShe died 3 December 2013, aged 105.[12]\\n(* Novels reedited as Ida Pollock)\\n(* Novels reedited as Ida Pollock)\\n',\n",

In 1949, she graduated at the Liverpool University, where she met Robert Kidd, her husband, with whom she had four children: Richard, Patricia, Peter and David.\\nThe Kidds moved to Scotland, where Flora began teaching. There, she wrote her first novel, which was published in 1966. She continued to write while their children grew.\\nIn 1977, the Kidd family moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada.\\nFlora Kidd\\'s debut novel Visit to Rowanbank (1966) is set in a first person narrative, and is indicative of the historical development of this genre by the Mills & Boon publishing house since all subsequent romance novels published by the series have been written in third person narratives. A critical year for switch from first to third person can be traced to the year 1968 through an example of a collection of Isobel Chace novels, harlequin omnibus 7, where The Saffron Sky (1967) and A Handful of Silver (1968) were both written in first person narratives, while the last novel The Damask Rose (1968) switched to a third person narrative.\\nScotland and its surroundings are a mainstay of Flora Kidd\\'s stories in the beginning of her writing career.\\nShe realistically exploits her time spent in Scotland in stories that are full of local color describing customs, manners and re-creating dialects. For example, Whistle and I\\'ll Come (1967), My Heart Remembers (1971) and Stranger in the Glen (1974).\\nWhistle and I\\'ll Come (1967) is an homage to Scotland\\'s national poet Robert Burns. \\'Whistle my Love and I\\'ll Come Down\\' is a Scottish love ballad that predated Robert Burns and was refined by the latter into a wistful song. Flora Kidd adapts this popular song into a romantic novel. The following stanza from Robert Burns\\' song is introduced in the beginning of her story.\\n\\'O whistle, an\\' I\\'ll come to ye, my lad;\\nO whistle, an\\' I\\'ll come to ye, my lad:\\nThough father and mither should baith gae mad,\\nO whistle, an\\' I\\'ll come to ye, my lad. Robert Burns\\nLike her 1967 release Whistle and I\\'ll Come, she sets up the hero and the heroine of When Birds Do Sing (1970) against the theme of John Keats\\' poem \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\" (\"The Beautiful Lady without Pity\"). Although \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\" opens with a description of the knight in a barren landscape, \"haggard\" and \"woe-begone\", it is the heroine Lindsay in When Birds Do Sing (1970) who shares such sentiment. Unlike the conclusion of the first stanza of Keats\\' poem, Flora Kidd\\'s story has a happy ending where birds do sing.\\nO what can ail thee, knight at arms,\\nAlone and palely loitering?\\nThe sedge has wither\\'d from the lake,\\nAnd no birds sing. John Keats\\nMy Heart Remembers (1971) is a title borrowed from Robert Louis Stevenson\\'s poem To S.R. Crockett written in Valimia, which is also mentioned in the story. Sally from little seaside town of Portbride, Scotland finds her sib, a local expression best defined as soul-mate, in Ross since both share in the communion with surrounding moorland:\\nBlows the wind to-day, and the sun and the rain are flying,\\nBlows the wind on the moors to-day and now,\\nWhere about the graves of the martyrs the whaups are crying,\\nMy heart remembers how! Robert Louis Stevenson\\nThe Legend of the Swans (1973) is based on one of many Highland folklores, where a pair of swans return to the loch. The swans have come back after being away for three hundred years. Then the chief of the Macneal clan was the master of the glen where the loch belonged. Like the current master Captain Will Fox, he was a soldier, too. He brought a young bride with him from the South. But she was often lonely. One day she disappeared. She went south when the swans flew south. The glen has been cursed ever since. However, the curse is lifted when history repeats itself once more as Gina arrives in the glen with Will.\\nHer love for the Scottish highlands is evident in the warmth of the characters depicted in Stranger in the Glen (1974). Here the arrival of Duncan coincides in Jan\\'s imagination of the long-awaited return of a local hero whose last descendant, a young man, emigrated to Australia.\\nFlora Kidd inevitably uses various other locations for her stories. However, Scotland remains a sentimental favorite. For example, her 1979 novel Stay Through the Night set on the other side of Atlantic in the Caribbean, contains an episode in which the main protagonists are back in Scotland.\\nThe plots for Gallant\\'s Fancy (1974) and Enchantment in Blue (1976) also take off in the Caribbean Islands, indicating a period of writing that took Flora Kidd to the location of her novels. \"Gallant\\'s Fancy\" (1974) presents an interesting anecdote to the \\'typing pool\\' where all aspiring working girls were relegated at one time or another. A job offer in far away Caribbean seemed to the heroine a chance to break from the routine.\\nThe Canadian Affair (1979) shows Flora Kidd in her transition mode from Scotland to Canada.\\n',\n",

After completing half of the work required by her master\\'s program, Kitt left school to become the head librarian at the astronomy library where she had previously worked.\\n[2]\\nAlthough Kitt was comfortable with the job of cataloging the collection, she enrolled in classes at the Hayden Planetarium to learn more about astronomy so that she would be better at her job.  Through these classes she met many guest speakers such as Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov.[2]  In 1986, Asimov asked Kitt to illustrate a book he was writing on Halley\\'s Comet.[1]\\nKitt began writing in the early 1980s for her own enjoyment.[2][3]  In six weeks, she had transformed her first idea into a 500-page manuscript.  She continued to work on her ideas, finishing two additional manuscripts in the next year and a half.  Shortly after finishing her third story, Kitt read an article in The New York Times about an editor who was beginning a new line of books for Harlequin.  Kitt called the editor, who requested two of Kitt\\'s novels.  Within a week, the editor had purchased both books, Adam and Eva and Rites of Spring.[2]  In 1984 all three of her novels were published, making Kitt the first black author to write for Harlequin.[3]\\nIn 1995, Kitt emerged from the romance genre with her first mainstream novel, The Color of Love. This book has twice been optioned for film, once by HBO, and had nine printings by 2002.[2]\\nHer novels featured African-American characters, who rarely appeared in the gothic romances which she enjoyed reading.[3]  Kitt was one of the first authors within women\\'s fiction to write from both the female and male point of view.[2]  Unafraid to tackle social issues in her works, Kitt has used her novels to study surrogate motherhood, abandoned children, race relations, and interracial/class differences.[2]  She has also often tackled interracial relationships.[1]\\nKitt has been able to use her fine arts degree to illustrate one of her novels. In 1993 she designed and painted the cover that was eventually used for her novel Love Everlasting.[1]\\nIn 2000, Kitt was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for contributing a story to the anthology Girlfriends.[4]  Kitt has been nominated three times for Romantic Times Reviewer\\'s Choice Awards.  She is a recipient of their Career Achievement Award.[5]\\nIn 2003, Kitt retired from her job as a museum librarian. However, she remained active in the Special Libraries Association.[6]\\nIn addition to her writing, Kitt teaches a publishing and creative writing course at a college.[2]  She has also written two film scripts and has interned with ABC for daytime soap operas.[1]\\n',\n",

In 1985, she was named Miss Massachusetts 1985 and competed in the Miss America 1986 pageant in Atlantic City.\\nLisa Kleypas was born on 5 November 1964 in Temple, Texas, to Linda and Lloyd Kleypas, an architect. She began writing her own romance novels during her summer breaks from studying political science at Wellesley College. Her parents agreed to support her for a few months after her graduation so that she could finish her latest manuscript. Approximately two months later, at age 21, Kleypas sold her first novel.\\nThe same year she sold her first novel, Kleypas was named Miss Massachusetts. During her competition at the Miss America pageant, Kleypas performed a song she had written, earning her a \"talented nonfinalist\" award.\\nKleypas has been a full-time romance writer since 1985. Her novels have ranked high on major best-seller lists, sold millions of copies around the globe and have been translated into fourteen different languages.\\nIn October 1998, Kleypas\\'s Texas home flooded within a matter of hours after heavy rains inundated their town. She and her family lost everything except the clothes they were wearing and her purse. Within days, her colleagues at Avon sent boxes of clothes and books to help the family recover. For Kleypas though, the defining moment was after the flood, when she and her mother (whose home had also flooded), made a quick trip to the store to purchase toothbrushes, clean clothes, and other necessities. Separately, each of them had also chosen a romance novel, a necessity to them in helping them escape the stress they were currently under. To Kleypas, this realization validated her decision to write romance novels instead of more literary works.[3]\\nThough primarily known for her historical romance novels, Kleypas made an announcement in early 2006 concerning her momentary departure from historical romances to delve into the contemporary romance genre.[4] Kleypas has since written two additional historical romance series: \"The Hathaways\" and \"The Ravenels\", as well as an additional contemporary romance series, the \"Travis Series.\"[5]\\nKleypas lives in Washington with her husband, Gregory Ellis, and their two children, Griffin and Lindsay.\\nMany of Kleypas\\'s works are arranged into series. However, even books in different series often have common elements, such as the Westcliffs, Mrs. Bradshaw, Jenner\\'s, Mathilda, and the Wallflowers.\\n',\n",

Kramer first gained prominence as a member of the techno-pop band Information Society and later performed with other alternative rock and new wave groups such as 10,000 Maniacs, World Party, and the Golden Palominos. She has been the keyboardist for the Psychedelic Furs since 2002.\\nAmanda Kramer was born on December 26, 1961, in New York City. Her parents were Beverly Dennis and Russell Dennis, both of whom were actors throughout the 1950s. Beverly Dennis was cast in supporting roles in several Hollywood features, including William A. Wellman's classic 1951 proto-feminist western Westward the Women and Jean Negulesco's drama Take Care of My Little Girl (1951), and appeared regularly on the CBS (and later NBC) variety hour The Red Buttons Show (1952–1955). Russell Dennis gained minor roles in William Castle's mystery drama Hollywood Story (1951) and Mark Robson's romantic war picture Bright Victory (1951). In the 1950s both Beverly and Russell were blacklisted from mainstream Hollywood productions due to suspected Communist or Soviet affiliations. In response they soon sought out alternative careers in psychiatry and medicine, respectively.[1]\\nBeverly Dennis would become a therapist while retaining a keen interest in social advocacy, particularly for Second-wave feminism, in which she worked in furthering female empowerment in theatre, literature, film, and journalism. Russell Dennis died suddenly on March 29, 1964, aged 48, not long after receiving his medical degree. Beverly later remarried to World War II veteran and advertising executive Jerry Kramer. The family lived on New York's Upper West Side, during which time young Amanda Kramer attended Manhattan's progressive Little Red School House (LREI). The family later relocated to Beverly Hills, California.\\nWhile growing up in New York City of the 1960s and 1970s, Kramer expressed interest in music from a young age and soon began to train in classical piano. Kramer took inspiration from the emerging art and cultural movements of the times. Inspired by the raw energy and spirit of punk rock and the dexterity and freedom of jazz, Kramer's interests would be piqued by the emerging musical technologies of the 1980s. \\nAs a teenager, Kramer began her academic study of music at the Manhattan School of Music Preparatory Division, studying piano with Sonia Vargas. She would continue her studies at University of California at Santa Cruz and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. While studying electronic music and video production at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, Kramer encountered fellow student James Cassidy, which resulted in Cassidy inviting her to join his Minneapolis-based dance-pop group, Information Society.\\nIn 1988, Information Society released their self-titled major label debut on Tommy Boy/Warner Bros. Records, which was certified Gold. After departing from the band, Kramer returned to New York City to further a career that would include classical, pop, rock, and scoring for film and television. Kramer began a string of collaborations, first with Anton Fier as a core member of the Golden Palominos, recording several albums, including A Dead Horse (1989) and Drunk with Passion (1991). As part of the Golden Palominos, Kramer would write and record with Michael Stipe, Bob Mould, Bill Laswell, and Richard Thompson, amongst others.\\nKramer then became a member of 10,000 Maniacs, recording and touring the platinum-selling releases Our Time in Eden (1992) and MTV Unplugged (1993), before joining the British group World Party. Her first live performance as a member of the latter would be a Pyramid Stage appearance at the 1994 Glastonbury Festival.\\nIn the succeeding years, Kramer would be engaged in much studio and road work, playing on albums by artists such as Lloyd Cole (The Negatives, 2000), the Church (Man Woman Life Death Infinity, 2018), and, most recently, the Psychedelic Furs' first studio record in three decades, Made of Rain (2020).

From 2007 to 2008, she toured with Siouxsie Sioux and performed on the Finale: The Last Mantaray & More Show live DVD.\\nKramer has released four solo albums, incorporating the genres of world music, classical, experimental, jazz, and ambient: Wintermass (with Blake Leyh, 1994), Samsara (1998), Fallen Light Renew (2004) and Under the Sea (2011). The latter two albums were inspired by the poetry of William Blake and T.S. Eliot, respectively, and feature contributions from Karl Wallinger and Julee Cruise, amongst others.[2]\\nKramer has also composed for film and television.

       " '\\nJudith Krantz (née Tarcher; January 9, 1928 – June 22, 2019) was a magazine writer and fashion editor who turned to fiction as she approached the age of 50. Her first novel Scruples (1978) quickly became a New York Times best-seller[1] and went on to be a worldwide publishing success, translated into 50 languages. Scruples, which describes the glamorous and affluent world of high fashion in Beverly Hills, California, helped define a new supercharged sub-genre of the romance novel - the bonkbuster or \"sex-and-shopping\" novel.[2] She also fundamentally changed the publishing industry by becoming one of the first celebrity authors through her extensive touring and promotion - \"a superstar of fiction\".[3] Her later books included Princess Daisy (1980), Till We Meet Again (1988), Dazzle (1990) and Spring Collection (1996).[4]  Her autobiography, Sex and Shopping: The Confessions of a Nice Jewish Girl, was published in 2000.[5]\\nJudith Bluma-Gittel Tarcher was born on January 9, 1928,[6] in New York City, the daughter of Mary (Braeger), a Lithuanian-born attorney, and Jack D. Tarcher, an advertising executive.[7] Her family was Jewish.[8] The \"youngest, smartest, and shortest girl\" in her year,[9] she graduated from the upscale Birch Wathen School at age 16. Krantz then enrolled at Wellesley College.\\nKrantz told The Boston Globe in 1982 that she attended Wellesley with three goals: to date, to read every novel in the library, and to graduate.[9]  \"Torchy\", as her dormmates named her, held the dorm dating record as the only one to have 13 consecutive dates with 13 different men. Her grades were not as impressive as her extracurricular activities.[9] Krantz earned one A-plus in English, but had a B− average in her major and C average in everything else. Krantz had the opportunity to improve her marks when she took a short-story class during her sophomore year. Although the professor enjoyed her writing, he refused to give her an A because she had atrocious spelling, and he thought the B would teach her a lesson. Krantz claims to have learned the lesson well—she did not write fiction again for 31 years.[5]\\nAfter graduating from Wellesley in 1948, Krantz moved to Paris, where she worked in fashion public relations. She enjoyed attending elegant parties, borrowing couture gowns, and meeting prominent people such as Marlene Dietrich, Orson Welles and Hubert de Givenchy.[9]\\nThe following year, Krantz returned to New York City, where she embarked on a career in magazine journalism. She worked in the fiction department at Good Housekeeping before being promoted to fashion editor and having the opportunity to write several articles for the magazine.[10]\\nIn 1953 Krantz attended a Fourth of July party hosted by her high school friend, Barbara Walters.  There she met her future husband, the future film and television producer Steve Krantz.[11]  The two were married the following year, on February 19, 1954. Three years later, she gave birth to their first son, and she gave up her full-time job, choosing instead to write part-time from home.[10]  She wrote many freelance articles for Maclean\\'s, McCall\\'s, Ladies\\' Home Journal, and Cosmopolitan.  Her best-known article was \"The Myth of the Multiple Orgasm\", which was published in Cosmopolitan.[12] Her magazine career gave Krantz an opportunity to interview many prominent women.[10]\\nIn 1976, Krantz\\'s husband decided to take flying lessons.  Krantz chose to join him, despite the fact that she was afraid of flying.  Having conquered that fear, she determined to face her other fears.  For the first time since college, she attempted to write fiction.[5]  Although her husband had been insisting for years that she was a natural storyteller, Krantz believed that she was writing the book simply to prove to him that she was not able to write good fiction.[11]\\nShe completed her first novel, Scruples, nine months later.  The year it was published, 1978, Krantz turned 50. In an unusual turn of events for the time, the books were not copyrighted under her own name but by Steve Krantz Productions.[11] That first novel reached the number one spot on The New York Times bestseller list. There were two sequels: Scruples Two (1992) and Lovers (1994).[3]\\nHer second novel, Princess Daisy, followed in 1980 and netted her an astounding $5 million before its publication. It also became a number one best seller, with the paperback rights selling for a then-record $3.2 million.[13] It concerns the fabulously wealthy and glamorous Daisy, daughter of a Russian prince, who has to confront and overcome many harsh realities. The book is notable for having received one of the most scathing reviews ever written, by Clive James.[14] Krantz continued her run of success with Mistral\\'s Daughter (1982) (a multi-generational saga) and I\\'ll Take Manhattan (1986), (about writer and socialite Maxi Amberville, a thinly disguised portrait of the author).[3] Till We Meet Again (1988) which starts in the music halls of 1910s Paris and continues on until after the Second World War, was the last to make the annual top ten bestseller lists, though the later novels continued to be popular.\\nSpring Collection (1996) returns to the world of fashion, while The Jewels of Tessa Kent (1998) explores mother-daughter relationships - Krantz had a difficult relationship with her own mother.[15] She retired from writing that year at the age of 70, saying she had nothing left to say to her readers.[2] Over 80 million copies of her books are in print in over 50 languages. Seven of her novels have also been adapted for television (as either films or mini-series), with her husband having served as executive producer for some of them.[13] She also wrote one original mini-series for television, Judith Krantz\\'s \"Secrets\", in 1992.[16]\\nKrantz served on the advisory board of Compassion & Choices, an organization dedicated to providing choices for the dying.[17] In 2006, she joined the Board of the Los Angeles Music Center.[18]\\nKrantz\\'s husband, Steve Krantz, died in 2007 of pneumonia. The couple had two sons, Tony Krantz and Nicholas Krantz, both of whom reside in the Los Angeles area.[11] Krantz was the sister-in-law of children\\'s entertainer and television host Shari Lewis, who was married to Krantz\\'s brother, Jeremy P. Tarcher, publisher of nonfiction books on health, psychology and New Age spirituality.

Krentz is the author of a string of New York Times bestsellers under seven different pseudonyms. Now, she only uses three names. Under her married name she writes contemporary romantic-suspense. She uses Amanda Quick for her novels of historical romantic-suspense. She uses her maiden name for futuristic/paranormal romantic-suspense writing.\\nOver 35 million copies of Krentz\\'s novels are in print. With Sweet Starfire, she created the futuristic romance subgenre, and further expanded the boundaries of the genre in 1996 with Amaryllis, the first paranormal futuristic romantic suspense novel. She is an outspoken advocate for the romance genre and has been the recipient of the Susan Koppelman Award for Feminist Studies.\\nJayne Ann Castle was born on March 28, 1948, in Cobb, California, United States.[1] She and her two brothers were raised by their mother, Alberta, in Borrego Springs for the first decade of Jayne\\'s life.\\nShe earned a B.A in History at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1970.[2] Fearful that she would be unable to find a job using her degree, she elected to obtain her graduate degree in Library Science from San Jose State University. Immediately after graduation she married Frank Krentz, an engineer, whom she had met at San Jose State. The couple moved to the Virgin Islands, where Krentz worked for a year as an elementary school librarian, a time she refers to as \"an unmitigated career disaster\".[1] Realizing that she enjoyed being a librarian but not the aspects of teaching that working in an elementary school required, Krentz moved into the higher levels of academia, including a stint in the Duke University library system.[1] Krentz and her husband later moved to Seattle, Washington.\\nKrentz has been generous in sharing her wealth with libraries. She established the Castle Humanities Fund at UCSC\\'s University Library to allow the library to purchase additional books and has given money to 15 Seattle-area elementary schools to enhance their library budgets. She is also a member of the Advisory Board for the Writers Programs at the University of Washington extension program.[2][3]\\nWhile working at Duke, Krentz began writing stories her way, combining elements of romance novels with paranormal twists. For six years she wrote and mailed proposals for new novels, consistently receiving rejection letters.[1] She claims to have tried to stop writing several times during that period, but that it became a \"compulsion\".[3] During this time she and her family moved to Seattle, Washington to further her husband\\'s aerospace career.\\nKrentz continued writing, and, in 1979, she sold her first novel, Gentle Pirate.[1] That novel and several that followed were published within various category romance lines, as that was the only method in which contemporary romance was published. As more publishers began to release single-title contemporary romances, Krentz shifted into writing only single-title novels.[4]\\nHer first novels were released under her birth name, Jayne Castle. Krentz signed a contract allowing one of her publishers to own the name, and, after leaving that publisher, Krentz was unable to use that name on new works for ten years. This led to the creation of several pseudonyms, including Jayne Taylor, Jayne Bentley, Stephanie James and Amanda Glass. By the mid-1980s she had begun using only her married name, Jayne Ann Krentz, for all of her contemporary romance novels.[1]\\nHer 1986 novel, Sweet Starfire, was a futuristic romance, a subgenre that combined elements of romance novels and science fiction. The novel was a \"classic road trip romance\" which just happened to be set in a separate galaxy. In 1987 she published a second futuristic romance, Crystal Flame, which again allowed for a \"traditional romance plot unfold[ing] in an extraordinary world\".[5]\\nThe success of these books encouraged Krentz to try to write a real historical romance with a humorous twist, which she released under the pseudonym Amanda Quick.[5]\\nShe began writing paranormal futuristic novels of romantic suspense in 1996. Released under her maiden name, Jayne Castle, these novels are set far in the future in a world where everyone has a psychic talent and respectable people use marriage agencies instead of choosing their own mates. As is customary in her writing, in each case the protagonists have a mystery to solve or a villain to defeat.[6]\\nPsychic themes appear throughout Krentz\\'s work. In 2006 she began a new series, called The Arcane Society, which includes books written as Amanda Quick (historical setting), Jayne Ann Krentz (contemporary setting), and Jayne Castle (futuristic setting). The books tell the stories of members of the Arcane Society for the psychically gifted, and each hero and heroine has his or her own psychic power. The books feature a mystery for the protagonists to solve while they are learning to deal with their psychic abilities.[7] The heroes of her novels are always alpha males who are as strong and determined as her heroines.[8]\\nMore than 120 of Krentz\\'s romance novels have been published, with 32 placing on the New York Times Bestseller List. In total, there are over 23 million copies of her books in print.[3]\\nKrentz\\'s novel The Waiting Game was adapted for the Harlequin Romance Series teleplay in 2001.\\nHer books have won many awards. Krentz has been nominated 22 times for Romantic Times Reviewers\\' Choice Awards, winning in 1995 for Trust Me and in 2004 for Falling Awake.[9] She has also received a Romantic Times Career Achievement Award.[9]\\nAn outspoken advocate of the merits of romantic fiction, Krentz maintains that \"[p]opular fiction encapsulates and reinforces many of our most fundamental cultural values. Romance is among the most enduring because it addresses the values of family and human emotional bonds.\" To help educate the public about the genre she became the editor of and a contributor to Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women: Romance Writers on the Appeal of the Romance, a non-fiction essay collection that won the prestigious Susan Koppelman Award for Feminist Studies.[3] Krentz was the inspiration for, and first recipient of, the Romantic Times Jane Austen Award, created to \"honor those in the romance community who have significantly impacted our genre\".[10]\\n',\n",

       " 'Patricia Douras Van Cleve (June 8, 1919[2] – October 3, 1993), known as Patricia Lake, was an American actress and radio comedian. Presented as the niece of actress Marion Davies, she was long suspected of being her natural daughter, fathered by publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst. Lake acknowledged this relationship shortly before she died.[3]\\nShe was born in a hospital outside Paris, France.[2] Her date of birth is not known; according to her Los Angeles Times obituary, \"The year was sometime between 1920 and 1923; Lake never knew exactly.\"[2] The Social Security Death Index states she was born June 8, 1919.[1]\\nIn the 1920s,  speculation arose that Lake was the child of Hearst and Davies, who had carried on a public affair since 1917.[2] Hearst never divorced from his wife, Millicent Willson, whom he married in 1903, but the couple maintained separate lives.\\nMany reference books say that Lake\\'s parents were Marion Davies\\' sister Rose and her first husband, George Van Cleve.  The Lake family asserted that the newborn was given to Davies\\' sister, whose own child had died in infancy. The dead child\\'s birth certificate was reportedly altered to support the deception.[2] CBS News reported that Hearst acknowledged to Lake on her wedding day that he was her father.[4]\\nAccording to Magazine Americana, published by the Institute for the Study of American Popular Culture, after Rose and George Van Cleeve had separated, he kidnapped Patricia in 1924 and went into hiding.  Hearst\\'s detectives located the pair after five years and the girl was returned to Rose\\'s custody. She was returned to Van Cleeve\\'s custody after a court decision.[5]\\nPatricia attended Lawlor Professional School in Hollywood.[6]  The Lake family asserts that when Patricia lived with the Van Cleeves, Hearst paid the bills and arranged for her education at schools in New York and Boston.[2]\\nHearst and Davies reportedly took Patricia on trips to Europe and spent time with her.  Lake spent considerable time at Hearst\\'s San Simeon estate, is included in most home movies of Hearst and Davies, and accompanied them on many trips.[7]  Introduced as Marion Davies\\' niece, Lake socialized with such notables as Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Charlie Chaplin and Gloria Swanson.[8]  Lake lived with Marion Davies for the major portion of her life, and Hearst financially supported Lake all of her life.[7]  After Lake\\'s marriage, Davies continued to support both Patricia and her husband Arthur.[9]  When Davies died in 1961, half of her $20 million estate was left to Lake as an inheritance.[10]\\nHer features, \"suspiciously similar\" to those of Hearst, did not go unnoticed. Lake never made any public comment on the subject, even after the deaths of Hearst and Davies.[8]  Lake\\'s son said that hours before her death in 1993, she confirmed and asked her family to publish the identities of her biological parents.[2][11]\\nPatricia first met actor Arthur Lake when he was visiting at Marion Davies\\'s beach house.[12]  They married in 1937 at Hearst\\'s San Simeon estate.[13][14] Davies and Hearst jointly gave her away at the marriage ceremony.[7] (This would have made her 13 or 14 years old at the time of her marriage if she was born in 1923; 17 or 18 if born in 1919.)  Patricia and Arthur remained married for nearly 50 years until his death in January 1987.  They had two children: Arthur Patrick Lake (Arthur Lake Jr.) (born March 1, 1943),[15] and Marion Rose Lake (born October 6, 1944).[16]\\nBoth Patricia and her husband are interred in the same crypt as Marion Davies at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.[7]\\nLake performed in theater during the late 1930s through the mid-1940s.  When, after seven years, Penny Singleton left the radio sitcom Blondie in the mid-1940s, Lake replaced her as the voice of Blondie Bumstead for the remaining five years of the show, opposite her real-life husband Arthur Lake, who played Blondie\\'s spouse, Dagwood.[17][18][19]  In 1954,[20][21]  Lake also co-starred with her husband in an early television sitcom he created called Meet the Family.[22][23][24]\\nLake was selected by the Motion Picture Publicists Association to be one of the MPPA \\'Baby Stars\\' of 1940,[25][26][27] an award similar to the WAMPAS Baby Stars selections of 1922 through 1934.\\n',\n",

She wrote romance fiction and children\\'s stories under the pseudonyms Roberta Leigh, Rachel Lindsay, Janey Scott and Rozella Lake.\\nShe published her first novel in 1950 and was still actively working on new titles until a year before her death. In addition, she wrote and produced the children\\'s puppet television series The Adventures of Twizzle, Sara and Hoppity, Torchy the Battery Boy, Wonder Boy and Tiger, Send for Dithers and Space Patrol.\\nBest known as Roberta Leigh, she was born Rita Shulman in London to sometimes-poor Jewish parents who had emigrated from Russia.[1] In 1948, she married Michael Lewin, with whom she had one son, and was widowed in 1981.[1] She died age 87 on 19 December 2014.[1]\\nLeigh wrote her first romantic fiction at age 14, while still a schoolgirl at St Mary\\'s convent in Rhyl. She published a romance in 1950 as Roberta Leigh,[1] the first of over 160 novels. She also published children\\'s books and romances under the pseudonyms Janey Scott, Rachel Lindsay, and Rozella Lake. Following the death of her husband, she stopped writing romance novels but continued to produce serious fiction and children\\'s books while developing various television and film projects. She made a total of 275 cinematic works, becoming the first woman producer in Britain to have her own film company.\\nShe created seven puppet TV series: The Adventures of Twizzle (1957), Torchy the Battery Boy (1958), Sara and Hoppity (1962), Space Patrol aka Planet Patrol (1962), Paul Starr (1964), Send for Dithers (1966), and Wonder Boy and Tiger (1967); and the animated educational program Picture The Word (1965). Twizzle and Torchy were made in collaboration with Gerry Anderson, then Leigh and Anderson parted ways, Leigh to create Sara and Hoppity (1962) and Anderson to create Four Feather Falls (1960). \\nSpace Patrol was syndicated around the globe and achieved the highest ratings of any children\\'s show up to that time,[citation needed] chronicling the year 2100 adventures of Captain Larry Dart of the spaceship Galasphere 347. This was followed by the Paul Starr (1964), and a live-action colour space adventure series, The Solarnauts (1967). For these two later series, however, only the pilot episodes were filmed.\\nLeigh developed a keen interest in music during childhood,[2] and was credited as the composer for most of her shows. However, most of her compositions were simply hummed into a tape recorder and translated into a score by a composer.[3] She did, however, tinker with electronic equipment to create the opening theme for Space Patrol, after asking a shop clerk for something that made interesting sounds.[4] In addition to collaborations on Twizzle and Torchy, Leigh teamed with Barry Gray for three musical compositions (Riding My Bike,[5] Sleeping Time[6] and Why?[7]) featured on Vera Lynn\\'s 1955 album \"Songs for Children.\"[8][9] Her surname appears as Lee on the record, but the proper spelling is featured on the sheet music. In addition to two tie-in albums for Twizzle,[10][11] Leigh also reinterpreted the popular stories Cinderella and Jack and the Beanstalk with original songs,[12] plus she wrote and narrated The Wonderful Story of How You Were Born,[13] a frank spoken-word sex education record.\\nThough made in 1964, Paul Starr appeared to be a decade ahead of Space Patrol. A 25-minute marionette puppet series in the same vein as Space Patrol, it was produced in colour. Agent Paul Starr and his crewman, Lightning, work for the Space Bureau of Investigation (SBI). They have a squat rocket, SBI-5, which can travel through space, in air and underwater (SBI uses an undersea base). While jets propel the craft through the air, in space it is powered by \"solar energy\". It is armed with various weapons, including nuclear missiles. The robots of Paul Starr appear to be more developed and fans of Space Patrol will notice the similar sound effects used. The movements of the puppet characters are \"less wooden\" and there is no sign of strings. Only a pilot episode was filmed and shown, but the series was not picked up.\\nThe puppets were made by Martin and Heather Granger who, with Joan Garrick, also operated them. Realistic mouth movements were used long before the arrival of Terrahawks in the 1980s. Actor Edward Bishop provided the voice of Paul Starr; other voices were provided by Patricia English, Dick Vosburgh and Peter Reeves. Besides creating and scripting the series, Leigh also wrote the title song and lyrics (sung by Jerry Dane). Arthur Provis served as director of photography and co-producer.\\nIn this adventure, Starr\\'s boss sends him to Mars where five atomic power stations (used to pump water) have been destroyed by fire. Starr and Lightning work as security guards to try to uncover the cause. The chief suspect is General Darynx. The Martians are shown as non-human fish people.\\nThis was a colour live-action space adventure TV series, produced in 1967, and starred John Garfield, Jr. and Derek Fowlds. Like Paul Starr, its filmed material survives.\\nBooks credited to Roberta Leigh,[14] Rachel Lindsay,[15] Janey Scott or Rozella Lake.

He came to the United States prior to the Civil War and enlisted to be a Union Soldier. After the war, he became a missionary. In 1876, he married Ella Amelia Northrup in Lafayette, Indiana.[2] Her father, Samuel Lathrop, was the first Methodist missionary bishop in Montana.[citation needed] After living and teaching in Indiana, they moved to Salem, Oregon where he was the president of Willamette University. In 1886 he became a Congregational minister in Yaquina City, Oregon. There were six other children in the family with Alice being the middle child. In 1896, they moved to Tacoma, Washington and later to Seattle, Washington.[2]\\nIn 1904, she enjoyed a brief summer romance with Canadian landscape painter Tom Thomson.[3][4] Thomson was quiet, but Lambert would later write, \"We knew without words that we loved each other. We had ESP, hardly needing words, and I know he felt the same towards me.\"[5] Despite this, she laughingly rejected his marriage proposal.[3][4][5]\\n\\nLambert later became a writer;[6] in her 1934 self-published novel, Woman Are Like That, she describes a young girl who refuses an artist\\'s proposal and later regrets her decision.[4][7] Specifically, the main character, Miss Juliet Delany, remembers, For one disturbing year she had been desperately in love with a tall, dark boy named Tom, a commercial artist, who in the summer used to take her on streetcar rides to Alki Point and in the wintertime to the dusty dimness of the public library, where he would pore over prints and reproductions of the masters.

When later she learned that Tom had been drowned while on a sketching trip in Canada, she sealed up a section of her heart, never again to open it. Tom had been tall and slender, with thin, nervous hands and flashing eyes.

       " '\\nStephanie is a fictional character from the Icelandic children\\'s television show LazyTown. She is an aspiring cheerleader and dancer who inspires the other citizens of the titular town to stay active. She has pink hair and as such is nicknamed \\'Pinky\\' by the puppet character Trixie. She came to town to visit her uncle, Milford Meanswell, the mayor of LazyTown. Upon meeting the other children, she unsuccessfully attempted to get them to play along as opposed to staying at home playing video games and eating candy. This changed when Stephanie asked for the help of Sportacus. When he finally arrived, the whole town worked together to make LazyTown a more active place to live. Each episode of the show ends with Stephanie performing a song and dance routine to \"Bing Bang\", the show\\'s ending theme.[6]\\nThe character’s original Icelandic name is Solla Stirða. In the Icelandic version of the TV series, her voice was dubbed in Icelandic by Ólöf Kristín Þorsteinsdóttir.[7]\\nThe role of Stephanie was performed by Julianna Rose Mauriello in seasons 1 and 2.[8] In 2011, Julianna confirmed she would be leaving LazyTown, as she had grown too old to play the role of Stephanie. She was replaced by Chloe Lang for seasons 3 and 4. Stephanie was also played by Kimberly Pena in LazyTown Live! The Pirate Adventure, a stage production that toured throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2009.[9]\\nStephanie was depicted as being an athletic, sweet, shy, sassy, caring, optimistic, and smart 8-year-old girl.[10] Surprised by the inactivity of the residents of LazyTown, she cheerfully encourages them to participate in more active, energetic hobbies or pastimes such as sports, games, tickling Stephanie, and much more when they are downhearted when the temptations of candy or video games overcome her prodding. Despite this, Stephanie is characterized by her optimism and self-confidence, which she proudly promotes and shares with her peers in encouragement against all odds or challenges, always victoriously triumphing over any obstacles or antagonists by the conclusion of an episode.\\nStephanie\\'s attempts are often nearly thwarted by Robbie Rotten, but his plans are never foolproof and always end with Stephanie winning.\\nStephanie was originally created by Magnús Scheving for the stage play Áfram Latibær as \"Solla Stirða\" (\"Solla Stiff\"), a girl with stiff joints who dreamt of becoming a dancer. Solla also appeared in the sequel to the stage play, Glanni Glæpur í Latabæ. She was played by Selma Björnsdóttir and Linda Ásgeirsdóttir, respectively.\\nMagnús Scheving reworked Solla into Stephanie for the LazyTown television show. Shelby Young was originally pegged to play Stephanie in 2003, and filmed one unaired pilot before departing due to union issues.\\nUltimately, Julianna Rose Mauriello was chosen to play Stephanie, and played her for the first two seasons and LazyTown Extra before departing due to aging out of the role.\\nChloe Lang picked up the role of Stephanie for seasons three, four, and LazyTown Motivational Campaigns. and as of 2022 is the most recent actress to play Stephanie.\\nSimilar women with pink wigs, even after the show ended, appears on other media; examples include with the pink quartet featured on the music video \"Swalla\" (by Jason Derulo, featuring Nicki Minaj, and Ty Dolla $ign, as released on March 17, 2017).[11]\\nStephanie tends to wear a pink sleeveless dress with pale pink tights, pink socks, white and pink sneakers and a purple hairband. Her outfit, though, changes from time to time. For example, in \"LazyTown Goes Digital\" and \"Energy Book\", she wears pink leggings with her usual dress. She also wears tracksuits and other items of clothing, but they are nearly always pink. Her short bob hair is dyed pink. All her accessories are also pink. She is often seen carrying a pink purse with a heart on it, in which she carries her pink diary. As a pirate, she wore a pink bandanna with a white, fancy letter \"S\" on it for Stephanie, as well as a striped shirt, ripped pink leggings and pink socks.\\nChild development authors Lyn Mikel Brown and Sharon Lamb assert that Stephanie is interesting and makes pink a \"power color\" due to her quick thinking, computer gaming and sporty nature.[5]\\n',\n",

She published a romance in 1950 as Roberta Leigh,[1] the first of over 160 novels. She also published children\\'s books and romances under the pseudonyms Janey Scott, Rachel Lindsay, and Rozella Lake. Following the death of her husband, she stopped writing romance novels but continued to produce serious fiction and children\\'s books while developing various television and film projects. She made a total of 275 cinematic works, becoming the first woman producer in Britain to have her own film company.\\nShe created seven puppet TV series: The Adventures of Twizzle (1957), Torchy the Battery Boy (1958), Sara and Hoppity (1962), Space Patrol aka Planet Patrol (1962), Paul Starr (1964), Send for Dithers (1966), and Wonder Boy and Tiger (1967); and the animated educational program Picture The Word (1965). Twizzle and Torchy were made in collaboration with Gerry Anderson, then Leigh and Anderson parted ways, Leigh to create Sara and Hoppity (1962) and Anderson to create Four Feather Falls (1960). \\nSpace Patrol was syndicated around the globe and achieved the highest ratings of any children\\'s show up to that time,[citation needed] chronicling the year 2100 adventures of Captain Larry Dart of the spaceship Galasphere 347. This was followed by the Paul Starr (1964), and a live-action colour space adventure series, The Solarnauts (1967). For these two later series, however, only the pilot episodes were filmed.\\nLeigh developed a keen interest in music during childhood,[2] and was credited as the composer for most of her shows. However, most of her compositions were simply hummed into a tape recorder and translated into a score by a composer.[3] She did, however, tinker with electronic equipment to create the opening theme for Space Patrol, after asking a shop clerk for something that made interesting sounds.[4] In addition to collaborations on Twizzle and Torchy, Leigh teamed with Barry Gray for three musical compositions (Riding My Bike,[5] Sleeping Time[6] and Why?[7]) featured on Vera Lynn\\'s 1955 album \"Songs for Children.\"[8][9] Her surname appears as Lee on the record, but the proper spelling is featured on the sheet music.

A 25-minute marionette puppet series in the same vein as Space Patrol, it was produced in colour. Agent Paul Starr and his crewman, Lightning, work for the Space Bureau of Investigation (SBI). They have a squat rocket, SBI-5, which can travel through space, in air and underwater (SBI uses an undersea base). While jets propel the craft through the air, in space it is powered by \"solar energy\". It is armed with various weapons, including nuclear missiles. The robots of Paul Starr appear to be more developed and fans of Space Patrol will notice the similar sound effects used. The movements of the puppet characters are \"less wooden\" and there is no sign of strings. Only a pilot episode was filmed and shown, but the series was not picked up.\\nThe puppets were made by Martin and Heather Granger who, with Joan Garrick, also operated them. Realistic mouth movements were used long before the arrival of Terrahawks in the 1980s. Actor Edward Bishop provided the voice of Paul Starr; other voices were provided by Patricia English, Dick Vosburgh and Peter Reeves. Besides creating and scripting the series, Leigh also wrote the title song and lyrics (sung by Jerry Dane). Arthur Provis served as director of photography and co-producer.\\nIn this adventure, Starr\\'s boss sends him to Mars where five atomic power stations (used to pump water) have been destroyed by fire. Starr and Lightning work as security guards to try to uncover the cause. The chief suspect is General Darynx. The Martians are shown as non-human fish people.\\nThis was a colour live-action space adventure TV series, produced in 1967, and starred John Garfield, Jr. and Derek Fowlds.

She wrote romance fiction and children\\'s stories under the pseudonyms Roberta Leigh, Rachel Lindsay, Janey Scott and Rozella Lake.\\nShe published her first novel in 1950 and was still actively working on new titles until a year before her death. In addition, she wrote and produced the children\\'s puppet television series The Adventures of Twizzle, Sara and Hoppity, Torchy the Battery Boy, Wonder Boy and Tiger, Send for Dithers and Space Patrol.\\nBest known as Roberta Leigh, she was born Rita Shulman in London to sometimes-poor Jewish parents who had emigrated from Russia.[1] In 1948, she married Michael Lewin, with whom she had one son, and was widowed in 1981.[1] She died age 87 on 19 December 2014.[1]\\nLeigh wrote her first romantic fiction at age 14, while still a schoolgirl at St Mary\\'s convent in Rhyl. She published a romance in 1950 as Roberta Leigh,[1] the first of over 160 novels. She also published children\\'s books and romances under the pseudonyms Janey Scott, Rachel Lindsay, and Rozella Lake. Following the death of her husband, she stopped writing romance novels but continued to produce serious fiction and children\\'s books while developing various television and film projects. She made a total of 275 cinematic works, becoming the first woman producer in Britain to have her own film company.\\nShe created seven puppet TV series: The Adventures of Twizzle (1957), Torchy the Battery Boy (1958), Sara and Hoppity (1962), Space Patrol aka Planet Patrol (1962), Paul Starr (1964), Send for Dithers (1966), and Wonder Boy and Tiger (1967); and the animated educational program Picture The Word (1965). Twizzle and Torchy were made in collaboration with Gerry Anderson, then Leigh and Anderson parted ways, Leigh to create Sara and Hoppity (1962) and Anderson to create Four Feather Falls (1960). \\nSpace Patrol was syndicated around the globe and achieved the highest ratings of any children\\'s show up to that time,[citation needed] chronicling the year 2100 adventures of Captain Larry Dart of the spaceship Galasphere 347. This was followed by the Paul Starr (1964), and a live-action colour space adventure series, The Solarnauts (1967). For these two later series, however, only the pilot episodes were filmed.\\nLeigh developed a keen interest in music during childhood,[2] and was credited as the composer for most of her shows. However, most of her compositions were simply hummed into a tape recorder and translated into a score by a composer.[3] She did, however, tinker with electronic equipment to create the opening theme for Space Patrol, after asking a shop clerk for something that made interesting sounds.[4] In addition to collaborations on Twizzle and Torchy, Leigh teamed with Barry Gray for three musical compositions (Riding My Bike,[5] Sleeping Time[6] and Why?[7]) featured on Vera Lynn\\'s 1955 album \"Songs for Children.\"[8][9] Her surname appears as Lee on the record, but the proper spelling is featured on the sheet music. In addition to two tie-in albums for Twizzle,[10][11] Leigh also reinterpreted the popular stories Cinderella and Jack and the Beanstalk with original songs,[12] plus she wrote and narrated The Wonderful Story of How You Were Born,[13] a frank spoken-word sex education record.\\nThough made in 1964, Paul Starr appeared to be a decade ahead of Space Patrol. A 25-minute marionette puppet series in the same vein as Space Patrol, it was produced in colour. Agent Paul Starr and his crewman, Lightning, work for the Space Bureau of Investigation (SBI). They have a squat rocket, SBI-5, which can travel through space, in air and underwater (SBI uses an undersea base). While jets propel the craft through the air, in space it is powered by \"solar energy\". It is armed with various weapons, including nuclear missiles. The robots of Paul Starr appear to be more developed and fans of Space Patrol will notice the similar sound effects used. The movements of the puppet characters are \"less wooden\" and there is no sign of strings. Only a pilot episode was filmed and shown, but the series was not picked up.\\nThe puppets were made by Martin and Heather Granger who, with Joan Garrick, also operated them. Realistic mouth movements were used long before the arrival of Terrahawks in the 1980s. Actor Edward Bishop provided the voice of Paul Starr; other voices were provided by Patricia English, Dick Vosburgh and Peter Reeves. Besides creating and scripting the series, Leigh also wrote the title song and lyrics (sung by Jerry Dane). Arthur Provis served as director of photography and co-producer.\\nIn this adventure, Starr\\'s boss sends him to Mars where five atomic power stations (used to pump water) have been destroyed by fire. Starr and Lightning work as security guards to try to uncover the cause. The chief suspect is General Darynx. The Martians are shown as non-human fish people.\\nThis was a colour live-action space adventure TV series, produced in 1967, and starred John Garfield, Jr. and Derek Fowlds.

She has individually, and with co-author and husband Evan, written more than 50 novels and one non-fiction book. Her novels range from science fiction to historical fiction, and from romance to mystery to suspense.\\nAs a child, Maxwell read primarily classic literature. She did not read her first science fiction novel until college, and was not exposed to other genres, such as romance, until even later.[1]\\nMaxwell earned a B.A. in English literature[1] from the University of California, Riverside in 1966.[2] Shortly thereafter, she married Evan Maxwell, a now former newspaper reporter who spent over fifteen years working for the LA Times,[1] covering international crime.[3] Early in their marriage, Maxwell became very bored. Her husband worked from 4:00 PM to midnight, and as there was no bus service near their house and Evan needed the car for work, Maxwell found herself alone at home with their toddler son. Maxwell did not like television and claims to have read all of the science fiction books in the local public library, in addition to everything science fiction in a local second-hand book store. After having exhausted all of her local Science Fiction options, she seated herself in front of her ancient manual typewriter and began to write a book she would enjoy, even though she had no training in creative writing.[1]\\nWhen Maxwell finished her book, a science fiction novel, she submitted it to several publishers. Over nine months later she began to receive rejection letters for it. After finally finding an agent to represent her, she was able to sell her first book, Change\\nAnn Maxwell has written over 50 novels, some individually and some in collaboration with her husband. Her novels have been published in 21 foreign languages, and there are over 23 million copies of her books in print.[1]\\nAnn Maxwell began her writing career in the science fiction genre. Her first novel, Change, was published in 1975. Over the next decade, eight other science fiction novels followed. Seven of those novels were recommended for the Science Fiction Writers of America Nebula Award,[4] with the first coming within one vote of being a Nebula Award finalist.[1] Another, A Dead God Dancing, was nominated for what was then called TABA (The American Book Award).[4]\\nAnn and her husband Evan, in conjunction with Ivar Ruud, a Norwegian polar bear hunter, published the non-fiction work The Year-Long Day in 1976. This book had been published in four countries and was condensed in Reader\\'s Digest.[4]\\nSeveral years later the couple began collaborating on a crime novel. This resulted in a series of books about a couple named Fiddler and Fiora, all published under the name A.E. Maxwell. The University of California gave one of the books, The Frog and the Scorpion, a creative writing award. Time magazine named Just Enough Light to Kill, one of the best crime novels of 1988.[4]\\nThe couple have also produced four best-selling suspense novels.[4] Although these books are the result of a collaboration, they are published as Ann Maxwell, as the publisher wanted to use a woman\\'s name.[5]\\nAnn and Evan have also collaborated to write the novelization of the 1992 Val Kilmer movie Thunderheart. This novel is written under the pen name Lowell Charters, taking his middle name and her maiden name.[3]\\nThe couple have a structured system for their collaborations to minimize arguments. Evan Maxwell usually chooses the setting for the story. Together, the pair create the characters and then the plot. Once the plot has been fairly well established, Evan writes the first draft of the manuscript, consulting Ann if there are any major questions about the characters or plot changes that he would like to make. Ann then writes the second draft, with the freedom to make any changes that she thinks are necessary for \"clarity, pacing, dialogue, and characterization.\"[1]\\nThe first dedicated word processor was introduced after Maxwell had already become established as a science fiction writer. She bought one immediately and soon found that she had tripled her productivity, as she was no longer forced to spend a great deal of time retyping her pages as she edited. This enabled her to get ahead of her contract, so Maxwell began to look for another type of writing that she would enjoy, but that would pay better.[1]\\nMaxwell approached her agent for ideas. The agent suggested that she look into thrillers, romance novels and horror fiction, as all three were becoming very popular. After reading several horror novels, Maxwell realized that she would not enjoy writing that type of fiction. Her husband brought her five Silhouette novels, three of which were for a brand-new line, Sihouette Desire. Although Maxwell thought the novels were well written, she did not really enjoy the first four stories. The last one that she read, Corporate Affair by Stephanie James (a.k.a. Jayne Ann Krentz) made her fall in love with the genre. Because she had never read romance novels before, Maxwell picked up over fifty additional category romances to familiarize herself with the expected format and then set out to write her own romance. The resulting novel, Summer Thunder, published in 1982, was the debut of her romance career.[1] This novel, and the more than thirty that have followed, are published under the pseudonym Elizabeth Lowell, a combination of Ann\\'s middle name (Elizabeth) and Evan\\'s middle name (Lowell), even though the books are written solely by Ann.[5]\\nAfter several years writing category romances, Maxwell turned to historical romance.[5] After she and her husband stopped writing their own mysteries, Maxwell found that she missed writing suspenseful plots and chose to take a slight turn into contemporary romantic suspense.[1] She has no plans to return to the historical romance genre.[5]\\nMaxwell\\'s romance novels have consistently placed on The New York Times bestseller list.[3] She has been awarded the Romantic Times Career Achievement Award in 1994, the Romance Writers of America RITA Award for Best Historical Romance in 1999 and The Romance Writers of America awarded her a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994.[2]\\nMaxwell spends her free time hiking, fishing for salmon, cooking, gardening, or spending time on the family\\'s boat.[1] She and her husband live in the Pacific Northwest. They have a son, Matthew, and a daughter, Heather, who are now grown.

They have since returned to Florida.[6]\\nWelfonder learned to read before she entered school and has long been an avid reader. She began corresponding with her favorite romance author Becky Lee Weyrich, describing her travels. Weyrich encouraged her to try writing romances.

She does her own research and often reads reference books about Scotland or the medieval period for fun. Each book takes her approximately six to eight months to write. When she is finished, Welfonder does not read any reviews of the book if at all possible. Negative reviews distract her, and often leave her unable to write for days at a time.[8]\\nIn 2006 Welfonder released Highlander in My Bed, a Scottish-set paranormal romance, under the pseudonym Allie Mackay.

Robb, Jill March and (in the U.K.) Sarah Hardesty.\\nRoberts was the first author to be inducted into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame. As of 2011, her novels had spent a combined 861 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, including 176 weeks in the number-one spot.\\nRoberts was born on October 10, 1950, in Silver Spring, Maryland, the youngest of five children.[2] Her parents have Irish ancestry, and she has described herself as \"an Irishwoman through and through\".[3] Her family were avid readers, so books were always important in her life.[4] Although she had always made up stories in her head, Roberts did not write as a child, other than essays for school. She does claim to have \"told lies. Really good ones—some of which my mother still believes.\"[5] She credits the nuns at her Catholic school for instilling in her a sense of discipline.[5]\\nDuring her second year in high school, Roberts transferred to Montgomery Blair High School,[6] where she met her first husband, Ronald Aufdem-Brinke.[7] They married, against her parents\\' wishes, in 1968, as soon as she graduated,[8][9] and settled in Boonsboro. \\nRoberts\\' husband worked at his father\\'s sheet-metal business before joining her parents in their lighting company. She gave birth to two sons, Dan and Jason. Roberts would later refer to this time period as her \"Earth Mother\" years, when she did crafts, including ceramics and sewing her children\\'s clothes.[8] The couple divorced[10] in 1983.\\nRoberts met her second husband, Bruce Wilder, a carpenter, when she hired him to build bookshelves in July 1985.[11][12] Her husband owns Turn the Page Books bookstore in Boonsboro, Maryland,[13] and works as an adult content photographer and videographer.[14]   The couple also owned the nearby historic Boone Hotel. After it was destroyed by a fire in February 2008, it was restored and reopened as the Inn BoonsBoro in 2009; the suites were inspired by and named for literary romantic couples with happy endings.[15]\\nShe is an ardent baseball fan, having been honored by the local minor league baseball team Hagerstown Suns several times.[16]\\nShe began to write during a blizzard in February 1979. Roberts states that with three feet of snow, a dwindling supply of chocolate, and no morning kindergarten for her two boys, she had little else to do.[17][18] She fell in love with the writing process, and quickly produced six manuscripts[19] which she submitted to Harlequin, the leading publisher of romance novels, but was repeatedly rejected. Roberts says,\\nI got the standard rejection for the first couple of tries, then my favorite rejection of all time. I received my manuscript back with a nice little note which said that my work showed promise, and the story had been very entertaining and well done. But that they already had their American writer. That would have been Janet Dailey.[20]Dailey would go on to be embroiled in a plagiarism scandal in which she eventually confessed to stealing some of Roberts\\' work.\\nRoberts once stated: \"You\\'re going to be unemployed if you really think you just have to sit around and wait for the muse to land on your shoulder.\"[21] She concentrates on one novel at a time,[22] writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation.[9] Rather than begin with an outline, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting.[21] She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. Roberts then  goes back to the beginning of the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the \"texture and color\" of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower.[23]\\nShe often writes trilogies, finishing the three books in a row so that she can remain with the same characters.[24] In the past, her trilogies were all released in paperback, as Roberts believed the wait for hardcover editions was too long for the reader.[4] All her new publications are released in hardcover first and e-book, with paperback editions following. \\nRoberts does much of her research over the Internet, as she has an aversion to flying.[9]\\nIn 1980, a new publisher, Silhouette Books, formed to take advantage of the manuscripts from the American writers that Harlequin had rejected.[25] Roberts\\' first novel, Irish Thoroughbred, was published in 1981, using the pseudonym Nora Roberts, a shortened form of her birth name Eleanor Marie Robertson because she assumed that all romance authors had pen names.[8]\\nBetween 1982 and 1984, Roberts wrote 23 novels for Silhouette,[8] published under various Silhouette imprints: Silhouette Sensation, Silhouette Special Edition and Silhouette Desire, as well as Silhouette Intrigue, and MIRA\\'s reissue program. In 1985, Playing the Odds, the first novel in the MacGregor family series, was published and was an immediate bestseller.[8]\\nIn 1987, she began writing single title books for Bantam. Five years later she moved to Putnam to write single title hardcovers and original paperbacks,[26] reaching the hardcover bestseller lists with her fourth hardcover release, 1996\\'s Montana Sky. Roberts has continued to release single-title novels in paperback. She still occasionally writes shorter category romances. Her attachment to the shorter category books stems from her years as a young mother of two boys without much time to read, as she \"[remembers] exactly what it felt like to want to read and not have time to read 200,000 words.\"[9]\\nRoberts was featured in Pamela Regis\\' A Natural History of the Romance Novel. Regis calls Roberts \"a master of the romance novel form\", because she \"has a keen ear for dialogue, constructs deft scenes, maintains a page-turning pace, and provides compelling characterization.\"[20] Publishers Weekly once talked about her \"wry humor and the use of different narrators, two devices that were once rarities\" in the romance novel genre.[9]\\nRoberts had long wanted to write romantic suspense in the vein of Mary Stewart, but, at the urging of her agent, she concentrated on classic contemporary romance while she built a following of readers.[9] After moving to Putnam in 1992, the publishing company quickly realized that they were unable to keep up with Roberts\\'s prolific output. They suggested that she adopt a second pseudonym so they would be able to publish more of her work each year.[24]\\nHer agent, Amy Berkover, convinced the publishers to allow Roberts to write romantic suspense under the new name.[9]  She chose the pseudonym D. J. MacGregor, but right before publication, discovered it was in use by another author.[17]  Instead, her first romantic suspense novel was published in 1995 under the pseudonym J. D. Robb. The initials \"J. D.\" were taken from her sons, Jason and Dan, while \"Robb\" is a shortened form of Roberts.\\nAs J. D. Robb, Roberts has published a series of futuristic science fiction police procedurals. These books, all part of the in Death series, feature detective Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke and are set in a mid-21st century New York City. Despite the emphasis on solving a crime in each of the books, the overall theme of the series is the development of the relationship between Eve and Roarke.[24] When the in Death series began, neither Roberts nor her publisher acknowledged that she was the author. They hoped to allow the series to stand on its own merits and build its own following.[27]\\nAfter publishing 18 novels in the in Death series, Putnam published the nineteenth, Divided in Death, first in hardcover. The book became Roberts\\' first bestselling novel of 2004.[28]\\nAs of March 2022, Roberts has published 54 novels plus ten novellas in the in Death series.[29]\\nRoberts wrote a story for a magazine titled Melodies of Love under the pseudonym Jill March.[17] She has also been known as Sarah Hardesty in the UK. When the Born In series was released in Britain it carried that name instead of Nora Roberts. She has since changed publishers.[17]\\nIn 1996, Roberts passed the hundred-novel mark with Montana Sky and, in 2012, doubled that with The Witness. In both 1999 and 2000, four of the five novels that USA Today listed as the best-selling romance novels of the year were written by Roberts. Her first appearance on The New York Times Best Seller list came in 1991,[22] and between 1991 and 2001, she had 68 New York Times Bestsellers, counting hardbacks and paperbacks. [30] In 2001, Roberts had 10 best-selling mass-market paperbacks, according to Publishers Weekly, not counting those books written under the J.D. Robb name. In September 2001, for the first time Roberts took the numbers 1 and 2 spots on the Publishers Weekly bestseller list, as her romance Time and Again was number one, and her J.D. Robb release Seduction in Death was number two.[31]\\nSince 1999, every one of Roberts\\'s novels has been a New York Times bestseller, and 124 of her novels have ranked on the Times bestseller list, including 29 that debuted in the number-one spot. As of January 24, 2013, Roberts\\'s novels had spent a combined 948 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, including 148 weeks in the number-one spot. As of January 9, 2009, 400\\xa0million copies of her books are in print, including 12\\xa0million copies sold in 2005 alone. Her novels have been published in 35 countries.[32]\\nA founding member of the Romance Writers of America (RWA), Roberts was the first inductee in the organization\\'s Hall of Fame.[9] In 1997 she was awarded the RWA Lifetime Achievement Award, which in 2008 was renamed the RWA Nora Roberts Lifetime Achievement Award.[33] As of 2012, she has won an unprecedented 21 of the RWA\\'s RITA Awards, the highest honor given in the romance genre.[34]\\nTwo of Roberts\\' novels, Sanctuary and Magic Moments, had previously been made into TV movies. In 2007, Lifetime Television adapted four Nora Roberts novels into TV movies: Angels Fall starring Heather Locklear, Montana Sky starring Ashley Williams, Blue Smoke starring Alicia Witt, and Carolina Moon starring Claire Forlani. This was the first time that Lifetime had adapted multiple works by the same author.[35] Four more films were released on four consecutive Saturdays in March and April 2009. The 2009 collection included Northern Lights starring LeAnn Rimes and Eddie Cibrian, Midnight Bayou starring Jerry O\\'Connell, High Noon starring Emilie de Ravin, and Tribute starring Brittany Murphy.\\nTIME named Roberts one of their 100 Most Influential People in 2007, saying she \"has inspected, dissected, deconstructed, explored, explained and extolled the passions of the human heart.\"[36] Roberts was one of only two authors on the list, the other being David Mitchell.[36]\\nIn 1997, another best-selling romance writer, Janet Dailey, admitted to repeatedly plagiarizing Roberts\\' work. The practice came to light after a reader read Roberts\\' Sweet Revenge and Dailey\\'s Notorious back-to-back; she noticed several similarities and posted the comparable passages on the Internet. Calling the plagiarism \"mind-boggling\", Roberts sued Dailey.[9] Dailey acknowledged the plagiarism and attributed it to a psychological disorder. She admitted that both Aspen Gold and Notorious lifted heavily from Roberts\\' work. Both of those novels were pulled from print after Dailey\\'s admission.[37][38] In April 1998, Dailey settled the case. Roberts donated the settlement to various literary causes including the Literacy Volunteers of America (now ProLiteracy).[9][39][40][41]\\nRoberts joined the chorus strongly criticizing fellow romance writer Cassie Edwards, who had lifted many passages from much older sources (many in the public domain) without giving credit, forcing Edwards out of the business.[42][43]\\nIn 2019 Roberts, along with other authors, was a victim of plagiarism by Cristiane Serruya.[44][45][46]\\nRoberts has been included repeatedly on the Giving Back Fund\\'s annual lists of the most philanthropic celebrities, with the bulk of her donations going to the Nora Roberts Foundation.[47][48][49] The foundation financially supports organizations that promote literacy and the arts, assist children and engage in humanitarian efforts.

She is best known for her time with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) between 1995 and 1998 as Queen Debra[4] and with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) between 1998 and 2002 as simply Debra. \\nMarshall began her career in professional wrestling in 1995, accompanying her husband Steve \"Mongo\" McMichael to the ring in WCW. She joined the WWF in 1998, where she managed the tag team of Jeff Jarrett and Owen Hart until Hart\\'s in-ring death in May 1999. Later that year, she won the WWF Women\\'s Championship from Sable in an evening gown match. She later appeared on-screen with her second husband Stone Cold Steve Austin until 2002, when the duo left the company.\\nRaised in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Marshall became a track-runner, cheerleader, and Homecoming Queen in high school before attending the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute in New York City.[4] She then became a flight attendant. Before her involvement in wrestling, she competed and won the title of 1987 Mrs. Illinois America in Elgin, Illinois[5] and went on to compete in the Mrs. America pageant that same year in Las Vegas, Nevada. She later competed and won in the 1992 Mrs. Texas USA pageant held in Houston, Texas[6] and went on to compete in the National Mrs. USA pageant. Marshall also attended the University of Alabama.\\nMarshall first appeared in WCW in late-1995 and early-1996, making occasional unnamed appearances as an audience plant, and as part of a group of valets for the team of Hulk Hogan and \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage. In April 1996, she began appearing regularly as a valet for her husband, Steve \"Mongo\" McMichael as he transitioned from commentator to wrestler. Based on her real-life participation in beauty pageants,[7][8] Debra took on the role of a beauty-pageant queen character, giving herself the nickname \"The Queen of WCW\" and often making remarks about other wrestlers and valets in kayfabe interviews.\\nAt The Great American Bash 1996, Steve McMichael and his partner Kevin Greene competed against two of the Four Horsemen (Ric Flair and Arn Anderson).[9] Flair won the match after Mongo and Debra turned on Greene by hitting him with a steel briefcase, joining the 4 Horsemen.[10] She managed the stable with Miss Elizabeth and Woman.  The briefcase later became one of Debra\\'s signature objects.[11] At Bash at the Beach in July 1997, Debra turned on Mongo during his WCW United States Heavyweight Championship match against Jeff Jarrett by handing Jarrett the steel briefcase, which he then used to knock Mongo out and thus to win the match.[12] Next, Debra briefly managed Goldberg and Alex Wright.[13] On the November 24, 1997 edition of Nitro, Wright fired Debra after she accidentally distracted him, causing a loss to Prince Iaukea. After her divorce from McMichael, Debra left WCW.[7]\\nIn October 1998, Marshall rejoined Jarrett in the WWF.[11] At the beginning of her WWF career, known as Debra McMichael and later simply as Debra, she played the part of a shrewd businesswoman, wearing business suits.[3][7] She also played the part of Jarrett\\'s girlfriend.[14] In late 1998, Jarrett began a feud with Goldust that culminated in December at Rock Bottom: In Your House in a \"Striptease match\".[15] During the match, Debra hit Goldust over the head with Jarrett\\'s trademark guitar, enabling Jarrett to win.[15] WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, disqualified Jarrett, and Debra had to strip due to the match\\'s stipulations.[15] As she stripped, The Blue Blazer (Owen Hart) and Jarrett covered her up.[15] Debra, however, began utilizing a new strategy during matches, distracting Jarrett\\'s opponents by unbuttoning her blouse.[7][14] She would willingly take off her blouse to show the crowd her \"puppies\", a nickname originally bestowed upon her chest by wrestler Road Dogg and later utilized by commentator Jerry Lawler.[16]\\nThe strategy helped Jarrett and partner Hart defeat The Big Boss Man and Ken Shamrock to become World Tag Team Champions in January 1999.[17] In February, Debra feuded with female professional wrestler Ivory, making her in-ring debut in a mixed tag match on Monday Night Raw, which ended in a no contest. Immediately after the bell rang, she attacked Ivory and hit her with Jarrett\\'s guitar.[18] The same month, Jarrett and Hart retained the tag title in a tag match against Ivory\\'s associates Mark Henry and D\\'Lo Brown at St. Valentine\\'s Day Massacre with Debra\\'s assistance.[19] In March, the team lost their tag title to the team of Kane and X-Pac.[20] She also competed in her first singles match, against Ivory but lost via disqualification after Jacqueline and Terri Runnels attacked Ivory during the match.[21] As Debra continued to manage Jarrett and Hart, a potential storyline developed where Hart and Debra would have an affair, but the creative team or Owen himself more likely vetoed the idea before it played out on-screen.[14] A team name was also in the works—Debra favoring \"Talent and Attitude\" (T&A)—but Hart died in May 1999 at Over the Edge.[11] Later in the event, Debra and Jarrett lost a mixed tag team match against Nicole Bass and Val Venis. Debra and Jarrett were interviewed moments after Hart\\'s fall from the rafters at Kemper Arena, where Debra was noticeably shaken and fighting back tears of concern for her friend and was unable to stay in her persona.[22]\\nOn May 2, 1999, Debra was scheduled to take on Sable in a \\'Nightgown\\' match, but was made to compete against Nicole Bass, against whom she lost.[21] On May 10, 1999, Debra won the WWF Women\\'s Championship from Sable in an evening gown match.[23] Usually, in an Evening Gown match, the woman who forcibly removes her opponent\\'s dress wins.[24] Because Sable removed Debra\\'s dress, she therefore should have been the winner.[24] Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, ruled that he considered the woman who had lost her dress the winner, crowning Debra the new Women\\'s Champion.[24] She held the Women\\'s title for a month and eventually lost it to Ivory on June 14, due to interference from Nicole Bass.[25]\\nAt SummerSlam in 1999 Jarrett faced D\\'Lo Brown.[26] During the match, Debra and Brown\\'s former tag-team partner Mark Henry interfered on Jarrett\\'s behalf, allowing him to win both the European Championship and the Intercontinental Championship.[26] The following night, Jarrett awarded Henry the European title and gave Debra an assistant, Miss Kitty.[27] Following an attack by Jarrett after losing a mixed tag match against Stephanie McMahon and Test,[21] on September 26, Debra turned on Jarrett at Unforgiven and hit him over the head with a guitar in the middle of his match against Chyna for the Intercontinental Championship.[28] Chyna pinned Jarrett, but referee Tom Prichard overturned the decision due to Debra\\'s involvement.[28] On the following episode of RAW, Debra participated in an intergender tag match with Chyna against the team of Jarrett and Prichard, in a winning effort.[21]\\nIn November 1999, Debra participated in an eight-women Sudden Death match at Survivor Series where she teamed with The Fabulous Moolah, Mae Young, and Tori in a winning effort against Ivory, Jacqueline, Luna Vachon and Terri Runnels[29] which also served as her last appearance as an in-ring performer, despite being trained at the time to compete. Debra subsequently stayed off television while her husband Stone Cold Steve Austin recovered from neck surgery.[11] She reappeared in April 2000, acting as a guest ring announcer at Backlash for the opening match.[11][30] In the fall of that year she played the role of Lieutenant Commissioner, the assistant of Commissioner Mick Foley.[3][11]\\nDebra resigned as Lieutenant Commissioner on the March 5, 2001 episode of Raw to pursue managing again, while it was revealed on-screen that she was the wife of Stone Cold. Mr. McMahon subsequently gave her the duty of managing The Rock, who at the time was feuding with Stone Cold.[31] During the feud, she appeared on an episode of RAW and slapped Vince McMahon Although she was advertised to be involved in a high-profile Wrestlemania 17 match between the two, she was later pulled due to both competitors lobbying not to have her out at ringside.[32] After Wrestlemania, she returned on an episode of RAW, questioning Vince McMahon for his role in Stone Cold\\'s villainous persona, and subsequently slapping him after he insulted her. During an episode of Smackdown, she appeared in a backstage segment and slapped The Undertaker, who was feuding with Austin at the time. \\nBy the second half of 2001, Debra accompanied Austin, as he defected to the Alliance, with a running gag about her famous chocolate chip cookies being repulsive (although Debra herself remained oblivious to this). On an episode of RAW, Debra was subject to a bucket of milk accidentally falling on her, which was a miscommunication by Stacy Keibler and Shawn Stasiak who meant to play the prank on Kurt Angle. The following week, Debra beat up Keibler with a tray of cookies in a backstage segment.[33]\\nIn August, during an episode of Smackdown!, Debra also clocked Stone Cold in frustration with a cookie tray in the middle of the ring.[33] The next week on RAW, she accompanied her husband to the ring for a match against Matt Hardy, and was involved in a physical altercation with Lita during the match.[33]\\nIn 2002, Debra was involved in a major backstage brawl with Stephanie McMahon after arguing over their respective husbands.[33] Debra appeared sporadically thereafter in backstage segments, notably slapping Ric Flair in a backstage segment in April on an episode of RAW. She left the company in June 2002 after her last RAW appearance with Austin, fanning the flames of their well-publicized marital fallout.[34]\\nFollowing domestic abuse charges against Austin and arrest, Austin eventually returned to WWE in 2003. Debra, however, was never invited back. References of Debra were subsequently dropped from WWE programming and media altogether, although, in 2021, she was acknowledged by WWE.com in a list of female performers who made an impact outside the ring.[35]\\nBefore becoming involved in wrestling, Marshall studied acting in Texas.[7] Her first acting jobs involved commercials and two music videos for country musician George Strait.[11] She also had a small role in the 1995 film The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre as a police officer.[7] The producers originally offered her the lead in the film, but when the director\\'s first choice changed her mind and accepted the role, Marshall was given the small role instead.[11]\\nOn March 10, 2002, Marshall appeared on an episode of The Weakest Link alongside several other members of the WWE roster.[36] In addition, she has a role in the 2010 film Gathering of Heroes.[37]\\nMarshall\\'s marriage to National Football League alumnus and professional wrestler Steve McMichael lasted thirteen years.[7] McMichael\\'s mother, whom Marshall met on an airplane, set up their first meeting as a blind date.[11] They divorced on October 12, 1998.[1]\\nDebra met Steven Williams, known on-screen as Stone Cold Steve Austin, in 1998; they moved in together in 2000.[2] On September 13 of that year, they married at The Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, and she changed her name to Debra Williams.[1][2] On June 15, 2002, police responded to a call to the couple\\'s residence in San Antonio, Texas, and found Debra with bruises and a bloody nose.[38] On August 14, the authorities arrested Austin and charged him with misdemeanor assault.[39] He pleaded no contest on November 25 and received a year\\'s probation, a $1,000 fine, and an order to carry out eighty hours of community service.[39] Austin filed for divorce from Marshall on July 22, 2002, and the divorce was finalized on February 5, 2003.[40] Marshall later auctioned her wedding ring off on eBay for $27,100 and donated a portion of the proceeds to \"Safe Place\", an organization which assists the victims of domestic abuse.[41]\\nIn June and July 2007, Marshall made several appearances to discuss the Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide. She described steroids and drugs as the cause of Austin hitting her in June 2002 and suggested links between such substances and the death of Benoit and his family.[42] She also alleged that Austin beat her three times.[42][43] However, she maintains a cordial relationship with Austin following the divorce.[citation needed]\\nMarshall graduated cum laude from the University of Alabama with an undergraduate interdisciplinary degree in 2013. In December 2017, she was awarded a Master of Science degree in criminal justice from the University of Alabama. While working on her master\\'s of science degree, Marshall was awarded the University of Alabama College of Arts and Science\\'s Mary Avis Todd Award for \"outstanding work in community studies\".[4][44]\\n',\n",
       " 'Dakota X (formerly Deborah Martin; (born June 9, 1961) is a contemporary American painter. X\\'s artistic work examines the complexities of individual experience particularly in its relation to home, isolation and memory. Much of the artist\\'s practice emerges in collaborative conversation with writers and poets, taking form through exhibitions and publications. X\\'s stark landscape paintings often convey the essence inherent within marginalized communities that exist on the fringes of American society.[1] In 2016, X focused on portraiture developing a long term project \"Portraits of Autism\" exploring the relationship and impact autistic children have within their immediate family and community on a continuum.[2][3][4]\\nIn a continued exploration of American landscapes, X has focused attention on two landmark \"saline\" sites in the United States known for their distinctive inhabitants, nontraditional social ecology, and unique architecture: the Salton Sea[5] and the Outer Cape area of Cape Cod. \"Home on the Strange: In Search of the Salton Sea\" is based on Polaroids taken over a period of several years, depicting various aspects of the reality of life on the Salton Sea. In this series, X examines the eerie atmosphere centered on the Salton Sea, a bizarre body of water accidentally created by an engineering fiasco in the early twentieth century when the Colorado River was diverted spilling the river\\'s water over a lowland directly on the site of the San Andreas Fault.[6]\\nThe \"Narrow Lands\" is a transdisciplinary project documenting the architectural geography of history and time along the Outer Cape. X\\'s paintings that feature structures on the Outer Cape have justly warranted comparisons to Edward Hopper’s. Like Hopper’s paintings, X\\'s interpretations provide neither a critical nor celebratory stance. Unlike Hopper, however, X\\'s application of paint is undetectable.[7][1][8]\\nX\\'s series \"Back of Beyond\" features scenes of the unincorporated town of Wonder Valley, located in Southern California’s Mojave Desert. The imprint of America is more than apparent in this group of landscapes that feature large, gas guzzling vehicles from the 1970s and \\'80s. Bleached bare from years of unprotected exposure underneath the sun’s aggressive blaze, X\\'s vintage sedans, vans, and convertibles don’t only evoke an air of abandonment, but they chronicle that which has been forgotten in exchange for what our commercially driven society considers worthy. X\\'s recent series, The Slabs: The Last Free Place in America, gives voice to the nomadic cultures that drift in and out of Slab City. While the inhabitants of Slab City are noticeably absent from X\\'s work, the paintings radiate with an underling pulse emblematic of the community’s soul. Such is achieved through the artist’s ongoing investigation of contrasting themes that touch upon isolation as well as community.[1]\\nIn this series Dakota X turns to ethereal abstraction to express the emotional experience of autistic children and the people closest to them. The intent of this body of work is to create a platform for social awareness while exploring the process a family goes through as their autistic child becomes an adult. The project focuses in part on relationship, connection and methods of communication while opening up a discussion about available support systems and funding for both children and adults diagnosed on the Autism Spectrum.[4] Portraits of Autism provides multiple opportunities for a better understanding of autism as it presents each subject with not only a highly skilled technical ability, but a compassionate viewpoint to show each child as a complete person not only defined by their disability.[2][3]\\n1992 BFA, School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, MA \\n1992 BS Master of Arts in Teaching, Art Education Tufts University\\nOrlowsky Freed Foundation Grant Sponsored in part by the Lilian Orlowsky and William Freed Foundation Grant and the Provincetown Art Association and Museum.\\nProvincetown Art Association and Museum\\n',\n",

       " 'Ann Maxwell (born April 5, 1944), also known as A.E. Maxwell and Elizabeth Lowell, is an American writer. She has individually, and with co-author and husband Evan, written more than 50 novels and one non-fiction book. Her novels range from science fiction to historical fiction, and from romance to mystery to suspense.\\nAs a child, Maxwell read primarily classic literature. She did not read her first science fiction novel until college, and was not exposed to other genres, such as romance, until even later.[1]\\nMaxwell earned a B.A. in English literature[1] from the University of California, Riverside in 1966.[2] Shortly thereafter, she married Evan Maxwell, a now former newspaper reporter who spent over fifteen years working for the LA Times,[1] covering international crime.[3] Early in their marriage, Maxwell became very bored. Her husband worked from 4:00 PM to midnight, and as there was no bus service near their house and Evan needed the car for work, Maxwell found herself alone at home with their toddler son. Maxwell did not like television and claims to have read all of the science fiction books in the local public library, in addition to everything science fiction in a local second-hand book store. After having exhausted all of her local Science Fiction options, she seated herself in front of her ancient manual typewriter and began to write a book she would enjoy, even though she had no training in creative writing.[1]\\nWhen Maxwell finished her book, a science fiction novel, she submitted it to several publishers. Over nine months later she began to receive rejection letters for it. After finally finding an agent to represent her, she was able to sell her first book, Change\\nAnn Maxwell has written over 50 novels, some individually and some in collaboration with her husband. Her novels have been published in 21 foreign languages, and there are over 23 million copies of her books in print.[1]\\nAnn Maxwell began her writing career in the science fiction genre. Her first novel, Change, was published in 1975. Over the next decade, eight other science fiction novels followed. Seven of those novels were recommended for the Science Fiction Writers of America Nebula Award,[4] with the first coming within one vote of being a Nebula Award finalist.[1] Another, A Dead God Dancing, was nominated for what was then called TABA (The American Book Award).[4]\\nAnn and her husband Evan, in conjunction with Ivar Ruud, a Norwegian polar bear hunter, published the non-fiction work The Year-Long Day in 1976. This book had been published in four countries and was condensed in Reader\\'s Digest.[4]\\nSeveral years later the couple began collaborating on a crime novel. This resulted in a series of books about a couple named Fiddler and Fiora, all published under the name A.E. Maxwell. The University of California gave one of the books, The Frog and the Scorpion, a creative writing award. Time magazine named Just Enough Light to Kill, one of the best crime novels of 1988.[4]\\nThe couple have also produced four best-selling suspense novels.[4] Although these books are the result of a collaboration, they are published as Ann Maxwell, as the publisher wanted to use a woman\\'s name.[5]\\nAnn and Evan have also collaborated to write the novelization of the 1992 Val Kilmer movie Thunderheart. This novel is written under the pen name Lowell Charters, taking his middle name and her maiden name.[3]\\nThe couple have a structured system for their collaborations to minimize arguments. Evan Maxwell usually chooses the setting for the story. Together, the pair create the characters and then the plot. Once the plot has been fairly well established, Evan writes the first draft of the manuscript, consulting Ann if there are any major questions about the characters or plot changes that he would like to make. Ann then writes the second draft, with the freedom to make any changes that she thinks are necessary for \"clarity, pacing, dialogue, and characterization.\"[1]\\nThe first dedicated word processor was introduced after Maxwell had already become established as a science fiction writer. She bought one immediately and soon found that she had tripled her productivity, as she was no longer forced to spend a great deal of time retyping her pages as she edited. This enabled her to get ahead of her contract, so Maxwell began to look for another type of writing that she would enjoy, but that would pay better.[1]\\nMaxwell approached her agent for ideas. The agent suggested that she look into thrillers, romance novels and horror fiction, as all three were becoming very popular. After reading several horror novels, Maxwell realized that she would not enjoy writing that type of fiction. Her husband brought her five Silhouette novels, three of which were for a brand-new line, Sihouette Desire. Although Maxwell thought the novels were well written, she did not really enjoy the first four stories. The last one that she read, Corporate Affair by Stephanie James (a.k.a. Jayne Ann Krentz) made her fall in love with the genre. Because she had never read romance novels before, Maxwell picked up over fifty additional category romances to familiarize herself with the expected format and then set out to write her own romance. The resulting novel, Summer Thunder, published in 1982, was the debut of her romance career.[1] This novel, and the more than thirty that have followed, are published under the pseudonym Elizabeth Lowell, a combination of Ann\\'s middle name (Elizabeth) and Evan\\'s middle name (Lowell), even though the books are written solely by Ann.[5]\\nAfter several years writing category romances, Maxwell turned to historical romance.[5] After she and her husband stopped writing their own mysteries, Maxwell found that she missed writing suspenseful plots and chose to take a slight turn into contemporary romantic suspense.[1] She has no plans to return to the historical romance genre.[5]\\nMaxwell\\'s romance novels have consistently placed on The New York Times bestseller list.[3] She has been awarded the Romantic Times Career Achievement Award in 1994, the Romance Writers of America RITA Award for Best Historical Romance in 1999 and The Romance Writers of America awarded her a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994.[2]\\nMaxwell spends her free time hiking, fishing for salmon, cooking, gardening, or spending time on the family\\'s boat.[1] She and her husband live in the Pacific Northwest. They have a son, Matthew, and a daughter, Heather, who are now grown. Maxwell\\'s daughter has published several books under the pseudonym Heather Lowell.[6]\\nThese books are rewrites of novels previously published under the Silhouette Intimate Moments line\\nThese books were in the Silhouette Desire line\\n',\n",

       " '\\nMary Elizabeth Braddon (4 October 1835 – 4 February 1915) was an English popular novelist of the Victorian era.[1] She is best known for her 1862 sensation novel Lady Audley\\'s Secret, which has also been dramatised and filmed several times.\\nBorn in Soho, London, Mary Elizabeth Braddon was privately educated. Her mother Fanny separated from her father Henry because of his infidelities in 1840, when Mary was five. When Mary was ten years old, her brother Edward Braddon left for India and later Australia, where he became Premier of Tasmania. Mary worked as an actress for three years, when she was befriended by Clara and Adelaide Biddle. They were only playing minor roles, but Braddon was able to support herself and her mother. Adelaide noted that Braddon\\'s interest in acting waned as she took up writing novels.[2]\\nMary met John Maxwell (1824–1895), a publisher of periodicals, in April 1861 and moved in with him in 1861.[3] However, Maxwell was already married to Mary Ann Crowley, with whom he had five children. While Maxwell and Braddon were living as husband and wife, Crowley was living with her family. In 1864, Maxwell tried to legitimize their relationship by telling the newspapers that they were legally married; \"however, Richard Brinsley Knowles wrote to these papers, informing them that his sister-in-law and true wife of Maxwell was still living, thereby exposing Braddon\\'s \\'wife\\' status as a façade\".[4] Mary acted as stepmother to his children until 1874, when Maxwell\\'s wife died and they were able to get married at St. Bride\\'s Church in Fleet Street. Braddon had six children by him: Gerald, Fanny, Francis, William, Winifred Rosalie, and Edward Herry Harrington.\\nHer eldest daughter, Fanny Margaret Maxwell (1863–1955), married the naturalist Edmund Selous on 13 January 1886. In the 1920s, they were living in Wyke Castle, where Fanny founded a local branch of the Woman\\'s Institute in 1923, of which she became the first president.[5]\\nThe second eldest son was the novelist William Babington Maxwell (1866–1939).\\nBraddon died on 4 February 1915 in Richmond (then in Surrey) and is interred in Richmond Cemetery.[6] Her home had been Lichfield House in the centre of the town, which was replaced by a block of flats in 1936, Lichfield Court, now listed. She has a plaque in Richmond parish church, which calls her simply \"Miss Braddon\". A number of nearby streets are named after characters in her novels – her husband was a property developer in the area.[7]\\nWriting\\nBraddon was a prolific writer, producing more than 80 novels with inventive plots. The most famous is Lady Audley\\'s Secret (1862), which won her recognition and a fortune as a bestseller.[3] Braddon began publishing the first chapters of her novel in July, 1861, in Robin Goodfellow, a literary magazine owned by Maxwell, and then later Sixpenny Magazine. From its serialized form, Lady Audley\\'s Secret was republished as a novel and sold through nine editions in its first year of publication. It has remained in print since its publication and been dramatised and filmed several times, with the first stage adaptation opening in London by the winter of 1863.[8]\\nIn addition to Lady Audley\\'s Secret, Braddon\\'s other best-known novel, Aurora Floyd, appeared in 1863. Since it also featured a woman trapped in a bigamous relationship, Aurora Floyd and Lady Audley\\'s Secret have been referred to as Braddon\\'s \"bigamy novels.\" Like Lady Audley, Aurora Floyd was first serialized in Temple Bar, a magazine, before appearing in novelized form.[8]\\nR. D. Blackmore\\'s anonymous sensation novel Clara Vaughan (1864) was wrongly attributed to her by some critics.\\nBraddon wrote several works of supernatural fiction, including the pact with the devil story Gerard or The World, the Flesh, and the Devil (1891), and the ghost stories \"The Cold Embrace\", \"Eveline\\'s Visitant\" and \"At Chrighton Abbey\".[9][10] From the 1930s onwards, these stories were often anthologised in collections such as Montague Summers\\'s The Supernatural Omnibus (1931) and Fifty Years of Ghost Stories (1935).[11] Braddon also wrote historical fiction. In High Places depicts the youth of Charles I.[12] London Pride focuses on Charles II.[12] Mohawks is set during the reign of Queen Anne.[12] Ishmael is set at the time of Napoleon III\\'s rise to power.[12]\\nPublishing\\nBraddon founded Belgravia magazine (1866), which presented readers with serialised sensation novels, poems, travel narratives and biographies, along with essays on fashion, history and science. It was accompanied by lavish illustrations and offered a source of literature at an affordable cost. She also edited Temple Bar magazine.\\nLegacy\\nThere is a critical essay on Braddon\\'s work in Michael Sadleir\\'s book Things Past (1944).[3] In 2014 the Mary Elizabeth Braddon Association was founded to pay tribute to Braddon\\'s life and work.[13]\\nSome bibliographical material in this incomplete list comes from Jarndyce booksellers\\' catalogue Women\\'s Writers 1795–1927.

Using her real name, Patricia Maxwell, she wrote Gothic mystery-suspense romances. She wrote one book in collaboration with Carol Albritton that was published under the name Elizabeth Trehearne. Under her maiden name, Patricia Ponder, she wrote a murder mystery and a romantic suspense story.

       " 'Mary Margaret McBride (November 16, 1899 – April 7, 1976) was an American radio interview host and writer.  Her popular radio shows spanned more than 40 years. In the 1940s, the daily audience for her housewife-oriented program numbered from six to eight million listeners. She was called \"the First Lady of Radio\".\\nMcBride was born on November 16, 1899, in Paris, Missouri, to a farming family. Their frequent relocations disorganized her early schooling, but at the age of six, she became a student at a preparatory school called William Woods College, and at 16 the University of Missouri, receiving a degree in journalism there in 1919. She was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta at the University of Missouri.[1]\\nShe worked a year as a reporter at the Cleveland Press, and then until 1924 at the New York Evening Mail. Following this, she wrote freelance for periodicals including The Saturday Evening Post, Cosmopolitan, and Good Housekeeping, and starting in 1926, collaborated in writing travel-oriented books.\\nMcBride first worked steadily in radio for WOR in New York City, starting in 1934.  This daily women\\'s-advice show, with her persona as \"Martha Deane\", a kind and witty grandmother figure with a Missouri drawl, aired daily until 1940.\\nOriginally, McBride\\'s character \"Martha Deane\" was to be a grandmother with six children and many grandchildren-all imaginary.  They were all named and described; she was to memorize the details.  Her job was to talk colloquially and dispense philosophy. She kept getting all her \"grandchildren\\'s\" names mixed up and within three weeks, she jettisoned the whole tribe on air. She remained Martha Deane, but was no longer a grandmother.[2]\\nConcurrently with working as \"Deane\", in 1934 and 1935, she was the women\\'s page editor for the Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicate.\\nIn 1937, she launched on the CBS radio network the first of a series of similar and successful shows, now as Mary Margaret McBride. She had to abandon the Deane persona because WOR owned the name and had replaced her in 1940 with Bessie Beatty.[3][4]\\nShe interviewed figures well known in the world of arts and entertainment and politics, with a style recognized as original to herself. She accepted advertising only for products she was prepared to endorse from her own experience, and turned down all tobacco or alcohol products.\\nShe followed this format in regular broadcasts on:\\nHer NBC show in the 1940s had broad range of guests, from politicians to generals to movie stars; she never announced her guests in advance, so the audience tuned in with no idea who they would get. Beginning during World War II, she began \"breaking the color line\", mixing in African American guests. McBride was a popular media figure; the tea rose,  \\'Mary Margaret McBride\\' was named for her.[5]\\nIn September 1948, NBC brought McBride to television for a 30-minute primetime show on Tuesdays at 9 pm EST, but abandoned the show in its partial third month, with Variety describing the attempt sarcastically, and The New York Times calling her the first major \"fatality\" of this kind.\\nBelow is a review of one of her first television performances, reviewed by The New York Times:\\nFrom 1953 to 1956, she also conducted a syndicated newspaper column for the Associated Press.\\nAbout 20 years apart, she wrote two books for girls, each with \"Elizabeth\" in the title.\\nAs time went on, she appeared in smaller radio media markets, in upstate New York, and toward the end of her life hosted Your Hudson Valley Neighbor three times a week on WGHQ Kingston, New York, from the living room of her home. Her longtime companion and business partner, Stella Karn, died in 1957.[6]\\nShe died at the age of 76 on April 7, 1976, at her home in West Shokan, New York. McBride\\'s ashes were placed in her former rose garden. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her work in radio.[7]\\nAn account of her career, It\\'s One O\\'clock and Here is Mary Margaret McBride: A Radio Biography by Susan Ware was published in early 2005. She is also discussed in depth in Radio Voices by Michele Hilmes.\\nThe character of Mary McGoon, featured in the comedy routines of Bob and Ray, is a parody of Mary Margaret McBride.\\nThe TV host Molly Margaret McSnide in Fantastic Four issue 16 is an obvious reference to her.\\nHer name was spoofed on the classic CBS-TV sitcom I Love Lucy in episode 79, \"The Million Dollar Idea\", which aired on January 11, 1954. In that installment, Lucy (Lucille Ball) comes up with an ambitious idea to make money. She decides to appear on television selling her Aunt Martha\\'s salad dressing. Assisting her on the program is her best friend Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance) as Mary Margaret McMertz.\\nMcBride\\'s celebrity was hardly a secret confined to daytime radio listeners, either; her 15th-anniversary celebration in 1949 was held in Yankee Stadium, the only facility large enough to hold the 75,000 people who filled every seat and formed huge crowds outside. Her magazine show was on the air continuously for 25 years.\\nMcBride pioneered a style of ad-libbing her radio shows, meaning that the content in her show was not rehearsed prior to going on the air. She was acknowledged by Current Biography[8] as \"the first woman to bring newspaper technique to radio interviewing and to make daytime broadcasts profitable.\" The method of sustaining her show was also distinct. McBride and manager Stella Karn would produce their show and then market it directly to sponsors in the New York area or broader national arena. This format allowed McBride and Karn to have complete agency over the content and format of the show. The two were consistently able to maintain a level of support from sponsors, meaning that they were able to produce content that was exactly how they envisioned it, free of outside changes. This model was also one of McBride\\'s notable contributions to broadcasting, as it paved the way for independent producing.[8]\\nMary Margaret McBride and Stella Karn met in the early 1920s in an instance of complete happenstance. As McBride describes it, “One day a bouncy woman, with eager brown eyes and auburn hair rolled into a bun, burst into our office and announced that she would be handling publicity for us.” McBride and Karn worked together for years, with Karn managing McBride and her show.  McBride described the two of them in a Reader\\'s Digest edition in 1962 as, \"No two people were more unlike. My reaction to a crisis was to dissolve into tears; Stella\\'s was to charge into battle.\" The two moved in together in a small apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City. McBride and Karn relied on each other for the entirety of their professional and personal lives.[9]\\nMcBride describes their first endeavor as a complete gamble motivated solely by Karn\\'s optimism. During the Great Depression, the opportunity came for McBride to audition for a radio show, one of the only sources of entertainment at the time. When McBride got the job, she immediately recommended Karn as the person to handle the business side of the show\\'s affairs. Karn and McBride became business partners, and Karn\\'s first act on the job was to give her partner a raise.[9]\\nMcBride and Karn made a name for themselves as pioneers in the field of broadcasting, and also as trailblazers for the future of lesbian and bisexual journalists. McBride and Karn established their show as a connection point for lesbian and bisexual female creatives, forging friendships with influential names in broadcasting such as Ann Batchelder and Lisa Sergio.[10]\\n',\n",

       " 'Judith McNaught (born May 10, 1944) is a bestselling author of over a dozen historical and contemporary romance novels, with 30 million copies of her works in print.[3] She was also the first female executive producer at a CBS radio station.\\nBorn on May 10, 1944, in San Luis Obispo, she majored in Business at Northwestern University. She married a St. Louis dentist and had two children, a daughter, Whitney, and a son, Clayton, before her divorce.\\nBefore gaining success as a writer, McNaught had previously worked as an assistant director for a film crew, an assistant controller of a major trucking company, president of a temporary employment agency, and president of an executive search firm.[4] She also was the first female executive producer at a CBS radio station.[5]\\nShe met her second husband, Michael \"Mike\" McNaught, while working as an assistant director for a film crew, working on a movie for a General Motors division.  McNaught was the director of public relations for the company.   Between them, they had seven children, her two and his five from a previous marriage.  Her husband encouraged her to write, buying her a new typewriter and being supportive through the years that publishers rejected her novels.[6]\\nMcNaught\\'s first manuscript was Whitney, My Love, which she wrote between 1978 and 1982.  After having difficulty selling that novel, she wrote and sold Tender Triumph in early 1982.  She received the book cover for Tender Triumph on June 20, 1983—the day after her husband  was killed in an accident.[7]\\nWhitney, My Love, the first manuscript, was finally published in 1985, after McNaught had proven herself with two successful published novels.[8] Unaware that there were rules that most Regency romances followed, McNaught\\'s early novels were unique.  Her novels introduced the hero first, rather than the heroine.  Unlike the typical Regency, \"a light romp with no sex,\" her novels tended to be \"intensely sensual and witty.\"[6]  The book is now credited with inventing the genre today known as the Regency Historical.  Whitney, My Love captured the elements of the traditional Regency romance, but its long length, sensuality, and emotional intensity were more often associated with the traditional historical romances, which were rarely set during the Regency period.   Despite the many years it took to sell the story, it was very successful, and its success influenced other editors to solicit manuscripts written in the same style.[8]\\nAt the beginning of McNaught\\'s writing career, she was one of a very few authors writing for the historical romance market.  By 1985, however, the genre had exploded, and over 50 new historical romances were being published each month, many of them full-length historicals set in the Regency period like McNaught\\'s.  Despite her years of success in the historical romance genre, in 1990 McNaught switched genres to write contemporary romances, hopeful that she would have a better opportunity to distinguish her work in a less-saturated market.  As her career has continued to mature, McNaught has gradually introduced elements of suspense into her writing.[7]  Regardless of their genre, however, her books tend to be fast-paced and feature strong, loyal, compassionate, intelligent female characters.[9]\\nMcNaught was one of the first romance authors to receive a multimillion-dollar contract and have her novels published in hardcover, better positioning them for review by major publications.[7]  She reached the New York Times Bestseller List for the first time in 1988,[4] and all of her subsequent books have also placed on the NYT Bestseller List.[5]  \\nAfter one of her novels placed on the New York Times Best Seller List for the first time, McNaught asked her publisher to change the covers of all future releases.  Instead of the common bodice-ripping cover, McNaught wished her books to be packaged with \"classy\" covers.[6]\\nIn the early 1990s, Coors Brewing asked her to write a book that would appeal to women and could be used by the company to promote its women\\'s literacy program.  Appalled at the discovery that one in five women was functionally illiterate, McNaught offered to rewrite her almost-completed manuscript, Perfect to insert the literacy theme.  The change took her an additional six weeks to incorporate.  McNaught chose to donate a portion of her earnings from the book to women\\'s literacy programs and insisted that each book contain a card giving readers information on how to donate to literacy programs or to become tutors.[6]\\nShe was the keynote speaker at the Romance Writers of America Conference in 1996,[7] and in 1997, Texas Women\\'s Monthly selected her among their four favorite authors, with John Grisham, Patricia Cornwell, and Dean Koontz.[10]  She has also been awarded a Romantic Times Career Achievement Award and had a Number 1 New York Times Bestseller with the romantic suspense Night Whispers.[3]\\nWhile McNaught at one time lived in Saint Louis, Missouri, she moved to Texas after falling in love with Dallas while on a book tour.[4]  Her third marriage, to Don Smith, a professional golfer and engineer, ended in May 1993.  McNaught described the break-up as peaceful and friendly, and she threw a party for 160 friends to celebrate entering a new phase of her life.[6]  As of 2007, she lives in Frisco, Texas.  McNaught is active in children\\'s charity and with breast cancer causes, and she has recently begun promoting literacy issues.  After creating a subplot on literacy in her novel Perfect, McNaught asked her publishers to include a response card in the book packaging.  Because of its inclusion, thousands of women who had read the book volunteered to become tutors and help people learn to read.[4]\\n',\n",

       " '\\nStephenie Meyer (/ˈmaɪ.ər/; née Morgan; born December 24, 1973) is an American novelist and film producer. She is best known for writing the vampire romance series Twilight, which has sold over 160 million copies, with translations into 37 different languages. Meyer was the bestselling author of 2008 and 2009 in the U.S., having sold over 29 million books in 2008[1] and 26.5 million in 2009.[2] Meyer received the 2009 Children\\'s Book of the Year award from the British Book Awards for Breaking Dawn, the Twilight series finale.\\nAn avid young reader, she attended Brigham Young University, marrying at the age of twenty-one before graduating with a degree in English in 1997. Having no prior experience as an author, she conceived the idea for the Twilight series in a dream. Influenced by the work of Jane Austen and William Shakespeare, she wrote Twilight soon thereafter. After many rejections, Little, Brown and Company offered her a $750,000 three-book deal which led to a four-book series, several spin-off novels and novellas, and a series of commercially successful film adaptations. Aside from young adult novels, Meyer has ventured into adult novels with The Host (2008) and The Chemist (2016). Meyer has worked in film production and co-founded production company Fickle Fish Films. Meyer produced both parts of Breaking Dawn and two other novel adaptations.\\nMeyer\\'s membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints shaped her novels. Themes consistent with her religion, including agency, mortality, temptation, and eternal life, are prominent in her work.[3] Critics have called her writing style overly simplistic, but her stories have also received praise, and she has acquired a fan following.\\nMeyer was included on Time magazine\\'s list of the \"100 Most Influential People in 2008\"[4] and was included in the Forbes Celebrity 100 list of the world\\'s most powerful celebrities in 2009, with her annual earnings exceeding $50 million.[5]\\nStephenie Morgan was born on December 24, 1973, in Hartford, Connecticut, the second of six children to financial officer Stephen Morgan and homemaker Candy Morgan.[6][7] Meyer was raised in Phoenix, Arizona, and attended Chaparral High School in Scottsdale, Arizona.[8][9] In 1992, Meyer won a National Merit Scholarship,[10] which helped fund her undergraduate studies at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, where she received a BA in English Literature in 1997.[11][12] Although she began and finished her degree at BYU, she took classes at Arizona State University in fall 1996 and spring 1997.[13]\\nMeyer met her future husband, Christian[N 1] \"Pancho\" Meyer, in Arizona when they were both children.[15][16] They married in 1994, when Meyer was twenty-one.[7][17] Together, they have sons whom Christian Meyer retired from his job as an auditor to take care of full time.[15][9]\\nBefore writing her first novel, Twilight, Meyer considered going to law school because she felt she had no chance of becoming a writer. She later noted that the birth of her oldest son, Gabe, in 1997 changed her mind: \"Once I had Gabe, I just wanted to be his mom.\"[18][19] Before becoming an author, Meyer\\'s only professional work was as a receptionist at a property company.[15]\\nAccording to Meyer, the idea for Twilight came to her in a dream on June 2, 2003, about a human girl and a vampire who was in love with her but thirsted for her blood.[20][21][22] Based on this dream, Meyer wrote the draft of what became chapter 13 of the book.[11] She wrote from chapter 13 to the end of the novel and then backfilled the first 12 chapters, in secret, without an ideal audience in mind or the intention to publish the novel.[23] Meyer researched the Quileute Native Americans to include their legends and traditions in the novel,[24] though some Quileute tribe members found her use of their legends offensive.[25] Meyer joined the American Night Writers Association (ANWA) for aspiring LDS female writers.[26] She completed the novel in three months.[27][28] Her sister\\'s response to the book was enthusiastic, and she persuaded Meyer to send the manuscript to literary agencies.[15]\\nOf the 15 letters she wrote, five went unanswered, nine brought rejections, and the last was a positive response from Jodi Reamer of Writers House.[29][30] Eight publishers competed for the rights to publish Twilight in a 2003 auction.[29] By November, Meyer had signed a $750,000 three-book deal with Little, Brown and Company.[31] Twilight was published in 2005 with a print run of 75,000 copies.[29] Bimonthly books signings and events at the Changing Hands Bookstore in Tempe, Arizona, early in her writing career helped cultivate her fanbase.[32] Twilight reached No. 5 on The New York Times Best Seller list for Children\\'s Chapter Books within a month of its release,[33] and later rose to #1.[34] The novel was named the Publishers Weekly Best Book of the Year and a New York Times Editor\\'s Choice.[35] Despite its success, Twilight was one of the most challenged books of 2009 according to the American Library Association for being sexually explicit, age-inappropriate, and for religious views; some schools and libraries were asked to remove the books from their shelves.[36]\\nUpon publishing Twilight, Meyer had already outlined a story for a sequel. However, her publisher insisted that she follow Twilight with two sequels following Bella and Edward in college.[37] Consequently, Meyer expanded the story into a series with three more books: New Moon (2006), Eclipse (2007), and Breaking Dawn (2008).[38] The original story she pitched for the sequel would later be published in Breaking Dawn.[37] Meanwhile, Meyer wrote a short story, \"Hell on Earth\", about demons at prom night, which was published in April 2007 in Prom Nights from Hell, a collection of stories about bad prom nights with supernatural effects.[38] Meyer\\'s fans urged her to expand \"Hell on Earth\" into a full novel, but Meyer was occupied finishing Eclipse.[39]\\nIn its first week after publication, New Moon reached No. 5 on The New York Times Best Seller list for Children\\'s Chapter Books, and in its second week rose to the No. 1 position, where it remained for the next 11 weeks. In total, it spent over 50 weeks on the list.[40] In May 2007, Meyer held two promotional prom events at an Arizona State University gymnasium to celebrate the special edition release of New Moon and the release of Eclipse. For the event, Meyer wore a blood-red evening gown and signed over 1,000 books.[41] Meyer\\'s red dress was later auctioned for $5,500 at a fundraiser for a book seller\\'s battle with breast cancer called Project Book Babe.[42]\\nAfter the release of Eclipse, the first three \"Twilight\" books spent a combined 143 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list.[27] The fourth installment of the Twilight series, Breaking Dawn, was released with an initial print run of 3.7 million copies.[43] Over 1.3 million copies were sold on the first day.[44] The novel won Meyer a British Book Award for Children\\'s Book of the Year, despite competition from J. K. Rowling\\'s The Tales of Beedle the Bard.[45] In 2009, Meyer faced plagiarism accusations for Breaking Dawn. Author of The Nocturne, Jordan Scott, claimed the circumstances around Bella\\'s supernatural pregnancy and subsequent transformation into a vampire were similar to the storyline of her novel and indicated that Meyer plagiarized the plot of The Nocturne. Meyer dismissed the accusation, claiming she had not heard of the writer nor the novel. Scott failed to produce a copy of the novel to support her accusation; The Nocturne is not available on Amazon and is listed as \"temporarily sold out\" on her website.[46]\\nThe series has sold over 100 million copies worldwide[47][48] in 37 languages.[49][50][51] In 2008, the four Twilight books were in the top four spots on USA Today\\'s year-end bestseller list. Meyer was the bestselling author of 2008 and the first author to have books in all four of the top-selling spots.[52] The Twilight novels held the top four spots on USA Today\\'s year-end list again in 2009.[53] The success of the Twilight series has been attributed to the Internet, which allowed Meyer to directly reach out to her fans, leading the series to be called \"the first social networking bestseller\".[54] According to scholar Lykke Guanio-Uluru, the Twilight series \"popularized and helped redefine, the paranormal romance subgenre\".[55]\\nIn 2004, Paramount\\'s MTV Films and Maverick Films optioned Twilight before the book was published in order to maximize its potential profits. The written script deviated greatly from the novel.[56] However, the film was put into turnaround. In 2006, Erik Feig, president of Summit Entertainment, attempted to make a deal with Meyer by assuring her that the film would be true to the novel and that \"no vampire character [would] be depicted with canine or incisor teeth longer or more pronounced than may be found in human beings\".[57] In 2007, the rights were sold to Summit Entertainment.[56] Catherine Hardwicke was chosen to direct the film, and Melissa Rosenberg wrote the new script.[58] Kristen Stewart was cast first as Bella Swan, and Robert Pattinson was cast as Edward Cullen after an audition with Stewart and Pattinson revealed they had good chemistry.[59] Taylor Lautner was cast in the role of Jacob Black.[60] Released on November 21, 2008,[61] the film received favorable reviews; Roger Ebert called the film, \"lush and beautiful\" and Peter Bradshaw said it was, \"wildly enjoyable\".[62] The film was a box-office success and became the fourth-highest-grossing November opening weekend release up to that time.[63] Meyer makes a brief cameo appearance in a diner scene.[64] The same year, Meyer began her work in film with a Jack\\'s Mannequin music video \"The Resolution\", which she co-directed with Noble Jones.[65][66]\\nFollowing the success of Twilight, Summit greenlit a film adaptation of the sequel, The Twilight Saga: New Moon.[67] Each novel adaptation was headed by a different director.[68] Chris Weitz directed New Moon,[69] which was released on November 20, 2009.[70] On opening night, New Moon broke the record for the highest single-day domestic gross on opening day, which had previously been set by Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.[71][72] Despite its commercial success, the film received poor reviews; Roger Ebert criticized the slow pace of the film, and Tim Robey of The Telegraph similarly said, \"the movie gives us all the requisite looks of tortured longing, and not a lot else\".[73][74] Directed by David Slade, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, an adaptation of the third book in the series, was released on June 30, 2010. An article from The Guardian reported that it was the best film of the series according to critical consensus for being more \"cinematic\" and striking a better balance between romance and the supernatural.[75] However, an article from The Telegraph rebutted The Guardian\\'s claim, arguing that Twilight remained the best film in the series due to the \"entirely straight-faced contrast between the forces of eternal darkness and the rigors of high school\".[76] Having already obtained the rights to Breaking Dawn,[77] Summit approved a two-part adaptation.[78]\\nIn 2011, Meyer started her own production company, Fickle Fish Films, with producer Meghan Hibbett. Meyer spent much of 2011 producing both parts of Breaking Dawn,[79] as well as the film adaptation of Shannon Hale\\'s novel Austenland.[80] Breaking Dawn: Part 1 was released on November 18, 2011, and the second part was released on November 16, 2012.[81] Part one of the film received mixed reviews.[82][83] Part two of the film received more positive reviews with Roger Ebert calling the ending \"sensational\". Critics also praised the acting, particularly that of Stewart.[84]\\nThe Twilight Saga was successful in the box office. With a combined budget of $373 million, the five-film series earned $3.341 billion worldwide.[85] Despite the commercial success, the films were extensively criticized. Breaking Dawn: Part II won seven Golden Raspberry Awards (Razzie awards) including Worst Picture, Worst Sequel, and Worst Screen Couple (for Taylor Lautner and Mackenzie Foy).[86] The series spawned two parody films: Vampires Suck and Breaking Wind, which were critical failures.[87][88][89]\\nIn 2009, Stephenie Meyer was included in the Forbes Celebrity 100 list of the world\\'s most powerful celebrities, entering at No. 26. Her annual earnings exceeded $50 million.[5] The same year, Meyer was ranked No. 5 on Forbes\\' list of \"Hollywood\\'s Top-Earning Women\", the only author on the list, and it was noted that the \"Twilight series of young-adult vampire books have taken the publishing and film worlds by storm\".[90] In 2010, Forbes ranked her as the No. 59 most powerful celebrity with annual earnings of $40 million.[91]\\nIn August 2009, USA Today revealed that Meyer broke J. K. Rowling\\'s record on their bestseller list; the four Twilight books had spent 52 straight weeks in the top 10.[92] In all, the books have spent more than 235 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list.[93] Upon the completion of the fourth entry in the series, Meyer indicated that Breaking Dawn would be the final novel to be told from Bella Swan\\'s perspective.[94] In 2015, she published a new book in honor of the 10th anniversary of the best-selling franchise titled Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined, with the genders of the original protagonists switched.[95]\\nOn March 30, 2010, it was announced that Meyer had written a 200-page novella entitled The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner. The book was released on June 5, 2010, by Atom and was available for free between June 7 and July 5 on the official website.[96] Following the release of The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner, Stephenie Meyer donated $1.5 million to the American Red Cross Relief Fund to aid victims of the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile. Those who took advantage of the free e-book were also encouraged to make donations to the Red Cross.[97][98][99]\\nMidnight Sun was to be a companion novel to the Twilight series. The novel was intended to be a retelling of the events of the novel Twilight, but from the perspective of Edward Cullen.[100] Meyer had hoped to have Midnight Sun published shortly after the release of Breaking Dawn, but after an online leak of a rough draft of its first 12 chapters, Meyer chose to delay the project indefinitely.[9] Upset by the release of a draft she called \"messy and flawed\", Meyer decided to pursue books unrelated to Twilight.[100][101] She made the unedited and unfinished manuscript of a lengthy character development exercise of Midnight Sun available on her website.[100]\\nThe release of Midnight Sun was tentatively re-planned after re-visiting the Twilight series with Life and Death, a gender-swapped retelling of the novel in 2015. However, the release of Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian in 2015 halted and soured Meyer\\'s plans to release the Midnight Sun because Grey was also told from the male perspective. Meyer stated in a New York Comic-Con panel that it was \"a literal flip the table moment\", admitting that \"Midnight Sun is kind of cursed\".[101][102] This led to the novel being on indefinite hold.[101][102] According to an article from The Guardian in 2018, Midnight Sun was \"no longer in the pipeline\".[87] However, in May 2020, it was announced that Midnight Sun would be released on August 4, 2020.[103] Following its release, it sold over one million copies,[104] was number two on Amazon\\'s \"most sold\" list,[105] and was number one on USA Today\\'s bestseller list one week after its release date.[106]\\nMeyer has mentioned having several other book ideas on file, including a ghost story titled Summer House, a novel involving time travel,[107] as well as another about mermaids.[108]\\nIn May 2008, Meyer\\'s adult sci-fi novel The Host was released by the adult division of Little, Brown and Company. It follows the story of Melanie Stryder and Wanderer, a young woman and an invading alien \"soul\", who are forced to work as one.[109][110] The Host debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list[111] and remained on the list for 26 weeks.[112] Despite having expressed intention to write a trilogy, with the second and third books being called The Soul and The Seeker, respectively,[113] Meyer has not published any follow-up novels to The Host as of 2022[update].[114]\\nIn April 2009, Meyer took part in Project Book Babe, a benefit designed to help pay her friend Faith Hochhalter\\'s medical bills after Hochhalter was diagnosed with breast cancer. Meyer donated many advance reader copies and original manuscripts for auction.[42]\\nThe Host was adapted into a film with Andrew Niccol directing, and Saoirse Ronan starring as Melanie Stryder, Max Irons as Jared Howe and Jake Abel as Ian O\\'Shea.[115][116] The film was released on March 29, 2013, to generally negative reviews.[117][118] It received poor critical reviews and was a box office flop compared to the Twilight film series.[119][120][121]\\nIn late 2015, it was announced that Meyer was producing a TV series based on Daniel O\\'Malley\\'s book, The Rook.[122][123] Despite having purchased the rights for the novel with her production company, she left the project shortly after filming due to creative differences.[124]\\nIn July 2016, Little, Brown and Company announced that Meyer has written an adult action thriller titled The Chemist, about \"an ex-agent on the run from her former employers\". The book was released on November 8, 2016.[125] In 2018, it was announced that Meyer\\'s production company Fickle Fish would be working with Tomorrow Studios to produce a television series based on The Chemist.[126]\\nThe reception of Meyer and her novels has been mixed.[87][127] Entertainment Weekly has stated that Meyer is \"the world\\'s most popular vampire novelist since Anne Rice\",[128] while The Guardian described her as an \"imaginative storyteller, a prolific author and a newly powerful figure in the publishing market\".[129] Wayne Janes of the Toronto Sun agreed, saying \"Meyer\\'s success points up another trend—the virtual domination of the best-seller lists the last few years by what would normally be classified as young adult fiction\", and noted, \"In the absence of a new Harry Potter adventure, teens, fantasy enthusiasts and women (sales are mostly to women) who swoon at the idea of a virginal James Dean-ish vampire made Meyer the go-to gal for chaste love.\"[130] Tymon Smith of The Times has described her as the \"superstar of young adult fiction\".[131]\\nMeyer was named one of MSN Lifestyle\\'s \"Most Influential Women of 2008\", where she was described as a \"literary luminary\".[132] She was also ranked No. 49 on Time magazine\\'s list of the \"100 Most Influential People in 2008\",[4] and was included in their list of \"People Who Mattered\", with author Lev Grossman noting, \"Maybe Americans aren\\'t ready for a Mormon presidential nominee yet. But they\\'re more than ready to anoint a Mormon as the best-selling novelist of the year.\"[133]\\nShe was ranked No. 82 on Vanity Fair\\'s list of the \"Top 100 Information Age Powers\" of 2009.[134] Meyer was featured in an issue of the biographical comic Female Force, a Bluewater Productions title that celebrates influential women in society and pop culture.[135] Meyer was the second bestselling author of the decade, according to a list published by Amazon, beaten by J. K. Rowling.[136]\\nDespite Meyer\\'s success, her novels have been highly criticized. The New York Times called the premise of Twilight \"attractive and compelling\"; however, the review continues, \"the book suffers at times from overearnest, amateurish writing\", indicating that Meyer\\'s relied too much on \"telling\" rather than \"showing\" and that there were excessive references to Edward\\'s attractiveness and Bella\\'s swooning.[137] An article from The Guardian criticized Bella\\'s character, calling her \"a clumsy, selfish nincompoop with the charisma of a boiled potato\" and criticized Edward\\'s portrayal as the \"perfect little gentleman\" who constantly counters Bella\\'s sexual advances.[138] NPR criticized the novel for being a repetitive \"jackhammer\" masked behind ornate language. Furthermore, they found the story uninteresting and the main character unlikeable.[139] Entertainment Weekly stated that the narrative of Breaking Dawn was at times so chaotic and outrageous that Meyer shifted the point of view to Jacob Black, which only toned down the mayhem of the plot for so long.[140]\\nNovelist Orson Scott Card said, \"[Stephenie Meyer] writes with luminous clarity, never standing between the reader and the dream they share. She\\'s the real thing.\"[141] In an interview with Newsweek, author Jodi Picoult said, \"Stephenie Meyer has gotten people hooked on books, and that\\'s good for all of us.\"[142] Comparing Meyer to J. K. Rowling, Stephen King stated: \"The real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer, and Stephenie Meyer can\\'t write worth a darn. She\\'s not very good.\"[143] King went on to assert that Meyer\\'s books appealed to readers because \"[she\\'s] opening up kind of a safe joining of love and sex in those books\".[143] American religious history scholar Jana Riess had mixed reactions to Meyer\\'s novels. At times, she found the Mormon theology that influences Meyer\\'s works to be beautiful and complex. However, she describes Meyer as a gifted storyteller, not a gifted writer, noting numerous technical flaws in her novels. Furthermore, Riess criticized the \"retrogressive gender stereotypes\" in Meyer\\'s work.[144]\\nThe Quileute do have a tradition that their ancestors transformed from wolves to people, but most of the descriptions of the Quileute in the novel are inaccurate.[145] The Quileute tribe described her use of their traditions in the books and films and subsequent merchandising as cultural theft.[25]\\nMeyer has gained a following among young adult readers of the Twilight novels, which are set in the small town of Forks on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state. Forks has thus received attention from fans and celebrates \"Stephenie Meyer Day\" on September 13, the date of character Bella Swan\\'s birthday.[146] Meyer\\'s fans cosplay her book characters, write fan fiction related to the stories, and attend book signings. Extreme fans are known as \"Twihards\".[87][27]\\nInspired by Meyer\\'s Twilight series, a genre of geek rock called \"Twi-rock\", similar in purpose to wizard rock inspired by J. K. Rowling\\'s Harry Potter series, has emerged. Examples of these Twilight-themed bands include the Bella Cullen Project, Twilight Music Girls, Be Safe Bella, Bella Rocks, and the Mitch Hansen Band. The Mitch Hansen Band wrote the song \"By You\" in hopes that it would be included on the New Moon film soundtrack.[147][148] An unofficial Twilight themed fan convention called TwiCon was organized in Dallas, Texas, in summer 2009, which included \"Twi-rock\" band performances, a Volturi Ball, panels, workshops, and vendors.[149]\\nOriginally an online novelized \"fan-fiction\" of the Twilight series, the novel Fifty Shades of Grey by E. L. James loosely explores the relationship between the main characters had they not remained celibate before marriage. Though the publisher claims the novel is \"original and no longer based on Twilight\", James did not receive copyright authorization to write the novel and some have argued that Fifty Shades of Grey may be a copyright infringement. Though Meyer has stated that the novel is \"too smutty\" and does not interest her, she has not filed a copyright claim.[150]\\nSince the release of Twilight, Meyer has been described as writing with \"all plot and no style\" and including \"very little characterization\", with her writing characterized as \"fairly\"[151] poor. Meyer\\'s prose lacks a consistent style or voice; for example, her short story \"Hell on Earth\" is driven more by dialogue alone, in contrast with the ornate descriptions found in the Twilight series.[152] Meyer relies on detailed expository descriptions[153] and active voice in her novels; she often opens her sentences with the most important information.[154] While a stylistic focus of most novels is character development, Meyer has stated that she intentionally avoided describing her characters in detail, which she believes allows the reader to more easily \"step into [their] shoes\".[155] In some works such as New Moon, in which Bella is largely on her own, Meyer offers \"deeper insight into Bella\\'s psyche\" through the chapter titles, rather than the prose itself.[156]\\nMeyer\\'s work is typically classified as melodrama. In Twilight, Meyer makes allusions to canonical texts such as the Book of Genesis, Wuthering Heights, Macbeth, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Songs of Innocence and of Experience. Meyer has said that the individual style of each of her novels came from various genres of music she listened to while writing.[157] A corpus stylistics analysis of the Twilight saga revealed that much of Meyer\\'s description and characterization revolved around the physical attributes of the characters as shown through eyes, face, and expression. Some of Meyer\\'s most frequent descriptions related to eye color and expression, the juxtaposition of warmth and cold, and the words \"black\" and \"dark\". The study authors concluded that the predictability and superficiality of Meyer\\'s descriptions indicate that Meyer\\'s writing style is unexceptional, and the success of her novels was related more to clever marketing.[158]\\nStephenie Meyer has named Mormonism as her greatest influence.[159] However, according to actor Robert Pattinson, Meyer did not intend to include Mormon references in the novels and films. Yet professor of film and religion Angela Aleiss noted numerous clear influence of Mormonism in the Twilight series.[160] Meyer has said, \"Unconsciously, I put a lot of my basic beliefs into the story. Free agency is a big theme.\"[161] Meyer cited BYU professor Steven Walker as having influenced her work. She explained that he revealed a new way for her to see and study literature, which impacts her writing.[162]\\nMeyer cites many novels as inspiration for the Twilight series, including Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë and L. M. Montgomery\\'s Anne of Green Gables and its sequels.[163] Each book in the series was also inspired specifically by a different literary classic: Twilight by Jane Austen\\'s Pride and Prejudice; New Moon by William Shakespeare\\'s Romeo and Juliet; Eclipse by Emily Brontë\\'s Wuthering Heights; and Breaking Dawn by Shakespeare\\'s The Merchant of Venice and A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream.[164] Although Meyer claims to have based Twilight on Pride and Prejudice, film studies scholar Anne Morey claims that the novel bears resemblance to Jane Eyre.[165] The choice to name Edward came from the works of Charlotte Brontë and Jane Austen, and her novels are influenced by both medieval courtly love and 19th-century etiquette.[166] Although Meyer has claimed that she did not read vampire literature and thus could not be influenced by it, scholars Anne Klaus and Stefanie Krüger argue that Meyer\\'s characters bear similarities to \"traditional vampire figures\" and that Edward resembles both gothic villains and Byronic heroes.[166] Meyer has indicated that despite the supernatural and vampire themes in her novels, she was influenced far more by Austen and Shakespeare than by Anne Rice or Stephen King.[167] Meyer has described Austen, Shakespeare, and Orson Scott Card as her favorite authors.[168][169][162]\\nMeyer cites music as a prominent influence of her writing, and she posts playlists of songs which specifically inspired her books on her website. Bands included most often in her playlists are Muse, Blue October, My Chemical Romance, Coldplay, and Linkin Park.[170][171][172][173] Meyer cites Muse as a particular inspiration because she uses the different emotions portrayed in their songs as influences for various genres of scenes.[174]\\nAccording to professor of American religious history Jana Riess, a prominent theme in Meyer\\'s novels is agency. In The Host, the Seeker believes that she is saving the human race by perfecting and controlling, similar to the Latter-day Saint belief that Satan\\'s plan for human salvation was to \"save\" all souls by removing their agency and ability to sin. The Seeker plays a Satan-like role in the novel, as Meyer attempts to convey the message that the maintenance of agency is crucial.[175] Additionally, Meyer\\'s novels contain the themes of opposition. In The Host, Wanda learns that despite the lows and evils of humanity, beauty and pleasure could not be found on her previous planets because darkness did not exist. Wanda learns in the novel that it is only in facing darkness and sorrow that light and joy could be experienced, echoing a quotation from the Book of Mormon, \"It musts needs be that there is an opposition in all things\".[176] However, \"imprinting\" in her Twilight series, the involuntary formation of a mate relationship, undermines Meyer\\'s prolific theme of free agency.[177] According to literature and women\\'s studies scholar Natalie Wilson, the juxtaposition between Bella\\'s agency to choose her mate and Jacob, a Native American male\\'s, inability to choose has racial and cultural implications.[178]\\nAnother theme is overcoming the circumstances and temptations of mortality referred to in the Book of Mormon as overcoming the \"natural man\", which is exemplified by Meyer\\'s character Edward.[179] As a vampire, Edward\\'s purpose is to be carnal, killing and feeding on human blood. As led by Carlisle, Edward chooses to give up this life and transcend his circumstances by becoming a \"vegetarian\", choosing to feed only on animals. He chooses to uphold these values despite the daily temptation, which only augments when he meets Bella; he finds her blood nearly irresistible.[180] Edward undergoes a transformation in which Bella\\'s trust in Edward allows him to trust his own ability to overcome temptation and keep Bella safe.[180] Self-control is a prominent theme in the Twilight series, the word appears 125 times throughout the novels, as the main characters struggle to control their emotions, attraction, thirst, or jealousy.[181]\\nApparent in Meyer\\'s Twilight series is the theme of the distinction between immortality and eternal life. In Meyer\\'s novels, vampires are immortal and have superhuman gifts and abilities; however, the Cullen family longs for things they cannot have. Their circumstances prevent them from forming meaningful relationships with humans or other vampires, isolating them within their small clan. Furthermore, the couples in the Cullen family are unable to procreate, which causes severe bitterness in Rosalie who envies Bella\\'s ability to be pregnant.[182] According to Riess, the distinction between eternal life and immortality is represented by Bella, who in Breaking Dawn, has achieved eternal life rather than immortality because she achieved the Mormon tenets of eternal life: immortality and a perfected body, eternal parenthood, and an eternal marriage.[182] Riess indicates that Bella receives immortality in an act of self-sacrifice rather than self-service, as she dies for the birth of her child. Bella is subsequently resurrected in a perfected vampire body. In Mormonism, resurrection occurs in the context of relationships, exemplified by Bella who enjoys her resurrected body in the company of her husband, child, and the rest of the Cullen family.[183] The titles of the novels serve to reinforce this idea. At the beginning of the series, Bella discusses leaving Phoenix and heading to Forks where she says, \"[goodbye] to the sun\".[184] The titles of the first three novels, Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse, serve as natural phenomenon in which the sun is darkened. However, the final novel is titled Breaking Dawn, which symbolizes the beginning of a new day and Bella\\'s transformation into a vampire and subsequent transcendence of her old life.[184]\\nMeyer is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and does not drink alcohol or coffee, smoke, or watch R-rated movies.[185][27] Similarly, there is no drinking and smoking in the novels (with the exception of her 2008 The Host, which contains drinking). Despite pressure to include a major sex scene, Meyer was adamant against including graphic sex in her series.[27] According to Lev Grossman of Time, some of the series\\' appeal is due to its lack of sex and its eroticizing of abstinence.[27] As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Meyer acknowledges that her faith has influenced her work. In particular, she says that her characters \"tend to think more about where they came from and where they are going, than might be typical.\"[186] Meyer says that she does not consciously intend her novels to be influenced by her religion or to promote the virtues of sexual abstinence and spiritual purity, but admits that her writing is shaped by her values, saying, \"I don\\'t think my books are going to be really graphic or dark, because of who I am. There\\'s always going to be a lot of light in my stories.\"[185]\\nGrowing up, Meyer\\'s life and family revolved around the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They were involved in their community, and a young Meyer met her future husband at church. She studiously read the Book of Mormon, citing the book as having \"the most significant impact on [her] life\".[187][188] However, Meyer dislikes when media constantly mentions her religion, saying that the press does not emphasize the religions of other authors.[189]\\nMeyer is cited as having played a part in bringing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints more into the mainstream by books The Mormon People: The Making of an American Faith by Matthew Bowman and LDS in the USA: Mormonism and the Making of American Culture by Lee Trepanier and Lynita K. Newswander.[190]\\nAccording to an article from The Guardian, Meyer considers herself a feminist. Meyer has stated that, \"the world is a better place when women are in charge\". Additionally, she was happy with the commercial successes of Catherine Hardwicke, the director of Twilight, and enjoyed working with a nearly all-female production for Austenland.[7] Meyer has explained that her definition of feminism is the ability for a woman to choose, and the definition of anti-feminism is removing the choice, whether it fits gender stereotypes or not, from the woman entirely. She continued that some modern feminists contradict their message of equality for women by limiting or shaming certain women\\'s choices. Furthermore, she stated that women who choose to stay home or have children are particularly criticized and that limitations on what women can do are anti-feminist in nature.[3][191]\\nHowever, Meyer has been criticized by feminists who consider Meyer an antifeminist writer. They say that the series romanticizes a physically abusive relationship, criticizing things like Bella\\'s entire life revolving around Edward; never being in control of her own life; being absolutely dependent on Edward\\'s ability to protect her life, her virginity, and her humanity; and the physical injuries Bella suffers from finally consummating her relationship with Edward.[192][193][194] Meyer has dismissed such criticisms, saying both that the books center around Bella\\'s choice and that her damsel in distress persona is due only to her humanity.[195] Women\\'s studies scholar Donna Ashcraft argues that Meyer is not a feminist, by definition, because her novels encourage traditional gender roles. However, although Ashcraft qualifies Meyer as traditional or non-feminist, she says that Meyer is not antifeminist.[191]\\nAfter being asked in an interview with The Guardian whether she is anti-abortion, Meyer refused to directly answer the question, insisting that she does not like to talk about politics and that she abhors when celebrities use their popularity to influence voters.[196]\\nTwilight series:\\nTwilight series:\\n',\n",

She became a published writer in 1964. She was married to Richard Mertz for 19 years (1950–1969); the marriage ended in divorce.[4] They had two children, Peter and Elizabeth Mertz.[5]\\nUnder the name Barbara Michaels, she wrote primarily gothic and supernatural thrillers. Her publisher chose that pseudonym since Mertz had already published one non-fiction book on ancient Egypt, and the publisher did not want Mertz\\'s novels to be confused with her academic work. Under the pseudonym Elizabeth Peters, Mertz published mysteries, including her Amelia Peabody historical mystery series, using a nom de plume drawn from the names of her two children.\\nShe was member of the Editorial Advisory Board of KMT, (\"A Modern Journal of Ancient Egypt\"), Egypt Exploration Society, and the James Henry Breasted Circle of the University of Chicago Oriental Institute.[6]\\nMertz was also a feminist, a topic that frequently arose in her fiction, and in her professional life. Mertz founded \"Malice Domestic\", a Washington-based organization for women mystery writers, \"because she thought men were getting all the prizes.\"[7] She also started a scholarship for women writers at Hood College.[8]\\nMertz died at her home in Maryland on August 8, 2013.[9] Her papers are held at the Lilly Library, at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.[10]\\nMertz received a number of award wins and nominations from the mystery community. Her first recognition came when Trojan Gold was nominated for the 1988 Anthony Award in the \"Best Novel\" category;[11] the following year, Naked Once More won the 1989 Agatha Award in the same category.[12] Following this Mertz earned a series of Agatha Award \"Best Novel\" nominations, including The Last Camel Died at Noon in 1991; The Snake, the Crocodile, and the Dog in 1992; Night Train to Memphis in 1994; Seeing a Large Cat in 1997; The Ape Who Guards the Balance in 1998; and He Shall Thunder in the Sky in 2000 which also received an Anthony Award \"Best Novel\" nomination in 2001.[11][12] Mertz received a final Agatha Award nomination for \"Best Novel\" in 2002 for The Golden One and won the \"Best Non-fiction Work\" the following year for Amelia Peabody\\'s Egypt: A Compendium, which also received an Edgar Award nomination in 2004 in the \"Best Critical / Biographical Work\" category.[12][13]\\nMertz was also the recipient of a number of grandmaster and lifetime achievement awards, including being named Grandmaster at the Anthony Awards in 1986 and Grandmaster by the Mystery Writers of America in 1998; in 2003, she received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Malice Domestic Convention.[14] In 2012 she was honored with the first Amelia Peabody Award at the Malice Domestic Convention; the award was named after the leading character in her long-running series.[15]\\nThis series contains 20 books; the most recent and last, The Painted Queen, was published in July 2017.\\nThe heroine is an Egyptologist and is married, with one child of her body, Walter, nicknamed and popularly known as Ramses, and two others of her heart: Nefret Forth (3 years older than Ramses) and Sennia (ca. 25 years younger). The stories all relate to the \"Golden Age\" of Egyptology and nearly all are set in Egypt, with the excavations providing the backdrop for the mystery/adventure plots.\\nThe timeline begins in the 1880s with Amelia\\'s decision to see the world as an unexpectedly wealthy feminist spinster, and ends with the discovery of Tutankhamun\\'s tomb in late 1922. (Peters had planned additional books in the series to \"fill in the blanks\" in the chronology, as she did with River: set in 1910, though it was written after other books that are set later.)\\nAdditionally: Amelia Peabody\\'s Egypt: A Compendium – (with Kristen Whitbread) Published October 2003\\nThe Vicky Bliss novels follow the adventures of an American professor of art history, who keeps getting involved in international crime, and her love interest, a charming art thief known as Sir John Smythe.[17] Another Peters novel, The Camelot Caper (1969) (also published as Her Cousin John), while not technically a Vicky Bliss story, features Smythe. The novels can be enjoyed in any order, but the stories are highly sequential in nature and are probably better appreciated if read in order of publication.\\nThis series and the Amelia Peabody series are slightly related: a fictional tomb discovered by Amelia Peabody and her husband plays an important role in Night Train to Memphis, and in The Laughter of Dead Kings it is revealed that John Smythe is related to the Emersons.\\nIn this series, Jacqueline Kirby is a middle-aged librarian with a very large purse and a knack for solving mysteries.[18] Initially an unwilling detective, and not the apparent protagonist, in the first book (The Seventh Sinner), Kirby\\'s quirkiness and middle-aged romantic success generated a following and led to sequels.[5] The series continued with The Murders of Richard III and Die For Love, each of which featured Jacqueline Kirby plumbing a mystery arising out of a subculture (Ricardians and romance novelists). In Die for Love, Kirby began writing a romance novel, and in Naked Once More, the fourth and final book of the series, has proven to be quite successful in that career. In Naked Once More, Jacqueline is commissioned to write a sequel to a \"famous\" prehistoric romance novel, whose author died under mysterious circumstances. In each of the books, Kirby solves a mystery, attracts one or more suitors, but remains alluringly aloof and independent.\\n',\n",

Roberts would later refer to this time period as her \"Earth Mother\" years, when she did crafts, including ceramics and sewing her children\\'s clothes.[8] The couple divorced[10] in 1983.\\nRoberts met her second husband, Bruce Wilder, a carpenter, when she hired him to build bookshelves in July 1985.[11][12] Her husband owns Turn the Page Books bookstore in Boonsboro, Maryland,[13] and works as an adult content photographer and videographer.[14]   The couple also owned the nearby historic Boone Hotel. After it was destroyed by a fire in February 2008, it was restored and reopened as the Inn BoonsBoro in 2009; the suites were inspired by and named for literary romantic couples with happy endings.[15]\\nShe is an ardent baseball fan, having been honored by the local minor league baseball team Hagerstown Suns several times.[16]\\nShe began to write during a blizzard in February 1979. Roberts states that with three feet of snow, a dwindling supply of chocolate, and no morning kindergarten for her two boys, she had little else to do.[17][18] She fell in love with the writing process, and quickly produced six manuscripts[19] which she submitted to Harlequin, the leading publisher of romance novels, but was repeatedly rejected. Roberts says,\\nI got the standard rejection for the first couple of tries, then my favorite rejection of all time. I received my manuscript back with a nice little note which said that my work showed promise, and the story had been very entertaining and well done. But that they already had their American writer. That would have been Janet Dailey.[20]Dailey would go on to be embroiled in a plagiarism scandal in which she eventually confessed to stealing some of Roberts\\' work.\\nRoberts once stated: \"You\\'re going to be unemployed if you really think you just have to sit around and wait for the muse to land on your shoulder.\"[21] She concentrates on one novel at a time,[22] writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation.[9] Rather than begin with an outline, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting.[21] She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. Roberts then  goes back to the beginning of the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the \"texture and color\" of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower.[23]\\nShe often writes trilogies, finishing the three books in a row so that she can remain with the same characters.[24] In the past, her trilogies were all released in paperback, as Roberts believed the wait for hardcover editions was too long for the reader.[4] All her new publications are released in hardcover first and e-book, with paperback editions following. \\nRoberts does much of her research over the Internet, as she has an aversion to flying.[9]\\nIn 1980, a new publisher, Silhouette Books, formed to take advantage of the manuscripts from the American writers that Harlequin had rejected.[25] Roberts\\' first novel, Irish Thoroughbred, was published in 1981, using the pseudonym Nora Roberts, a shortened form of her birth name Eleanor Marie Robertson because she assumed that all romance authors had pen names.[8]\\nBetween 1982 and 1984, Roberts wrote 23 novels for Silhouette,[8] published under various Silhouette imprints: Silhouette Sensation, Silhouette Special Edition and Silhouette Desire, as well as Silhouette Intrigue, and MIRA\\'s reissue program. In 1985, Playing the Odds, the first novel in the MacGregor family series, was published and was an immediate bestseller.[8]\\nIn 1987, she began writing single title books for Bantam. Five years later she moved to Putnam to write single title hardcovers and original paperbacks,[26] reaching the hardcover bestseller lists with her fourth hardcover release, 1996\\'s Montana Sky. Roberts has continued to release single-title novels in paperback. She still occasionally writes shorter category romances. Her attachment to the shorter category books stems from her years as a young mother of two boys without much time to read, as she \"[remembers] exactly what it felt like to want to read and not have time to read 200,000 words.\"[9]\\nRoberts was featured in Pamela Regis\\' A Natural History of the Romance Novel. Regis calls Roberts \"a master of the romance novel form\", because she \"has a keen ear for dialogue, constructs deft scenes, maintains a page-turning pace, and provides compelling characterization.\"[20] Publishers Weekly once talked about her \"wry humor and the use of different narrators, two devices that were once rarities\" in the romance novel genre.[9]\\nRoberts had long wanted to write romantic suspense in the vein of Mary Stewart, but, at the urging of her agent, she concentrated on classic contemporary romance while she built a following of readers.[9] After moving to Putnam in 1992, the publishing company quickly realized that they were unable to keep up with Roberts\\'s prolific output. They suggested that she adopt a second pseudonym so they would be able to publish more of her work each year.[24]\\nHer agent, Amy Berkover, convinced the publishers to allow Roberts to write romantic suspense under the new name.[9]  She chose the pseudonym D. J. MacGregor, but right before publication, discovered it was in use by another author.[17]  Instead, her first romantic suspense novel was published in 1995 under the pseudonym J. D. Robb. The initials \"J. D.\" were taken from her sons, Jason and Dan, while \"Robb\" is a shortened form of Roberts.\\nAs J. D. Robb, Roberts has published a series of futuristic science fiction police procedurals. These books, all part of the in Death series, feature detective Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke and are set in a mid-21st century New York City. Despite the emphasis on solving a crime in each of the books, the overall theme of the series is the development of the relationship between Eve and Roarke.[24] When the in Death series began, neither Roberts nor her publisher acknowledged that she was the author. They hoped to allow the series to stand on its own merits and build its own following.[27]\\nAfter publishing 18 novels in the in Death series, Putnam published the nineteenth, Divided in Death, first in hardcover. The book became Roberts\\' first bestselling novel of 2004.[28]\\nAs of March 2022, Roberts has published 54 novels plus ten novellas in the in Death series.[29]\\nRoberts wrote a story for a magazine titled Melodies of Love under the pseudonym Jill March.[17] She has also been known as Sarah Hardesty in the UK. When the Born In series was released in Britain it carried that name instead of Nora Roberts. She has since changed publishers.[17]\\nIn 1996, Roberts passed the hundred-novel mark with Montana Sky and, in 2012, doubled that with The Witness. In both 1999 and 2000, four of the five novels that USA Today listed as the best-selling romance novels of the year were written by Roberts. Her first appearance on The New York Times Best Seller list came in 1991,[22] and between 1991 and 2001, she had 68 New York Times Bestsellers, counting hardbacks and paperbacks. [30] In 2001, Roberts had 10 best-selling mass-market paperbacks, according to Publishers Weekly, not counting those books written under the J.D. Robb name. In September 2001, for the first time Roberts took the numbers 1 and 2 spots on the Publishers Weekly bestseller list, as her romance Time and Again was number one, and her J.D. Robb release Seduction in Death was number two.[31]\\nSince 1999, every one of Roberts\\'s novels has been a New York Times bestseller, and 124 of her novels have ranked on the Times bestseller list, including 29 that debuted in the number-one spot. As of January 24, 2013, Roberts\\'s novels had spent a combined 948 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, including 148 weeks in the number-one spot. As of January 9, 2009, 400\\xa0million copies of her books are in print, including 12\\xa0million copies sold in 2005 alone. Her novels have been published in 35 countries.[32]\\nA founding member of the Romance Writers of America (RWA), Roberts was the first inductee in the organization\\'s Hall of Fame.[9] In 1997 she was awarded the RWA Lifetime Achievement Award, which in 2008 was renamed the RWA Nora Roberts Lifetime Achievement Award.[33] As of 2012, she has won an unprecedented 21 of the RWA\\'s RITA Awards, the highest honor given in the romance genre.[34]\\nTwo of Roberts\\' novels, Sanctuary and Magic Moments, had previously been made into TV movies. In 2007, Lifetime Television adapted four Nora Roberts novels into TV movies: Angels Fall starring Heather Locklear, Montana Sky starring Ashley Williams, Blue Smoke starring Alicia Witt, and Carolina Moon starring Claire Forlani. This was the first time that Lifetime had adapted multiple works by the same author.[35] Four more films were released on four consecutive Saturdays in March and April 2009. The 2009 collection included Northern Lights starring LeAnn Rimes and Eddie Cibrian, Midnight Bayou starring Jerry O\\'Connell, High Noon starring Emilie de Ravin, and Tribute starring Brittany Murphy.\\nTIME named Roberts one of their 100 Most Influential People in 2007, saying she \"has inspected, dissected, deconstructed, explored, explained and extolled the passions of the human heart.\"[36] Roberts was one of only two authors on the list, the other being David Mitchell.[36]\\nIn 1997, another best-selling romance writer, Janet Dailey, admitted to repeatedly plagiarizing Roberts\\' work. The practice came to light after a reader read Roberts\\' Sweet Revenge and Dailey\\'s Notorious back-to-back; she noticed several similarities and posted the comparable passages on the Internet. Calling the plagiarism \"mind-boggling\", Roberts sued Dailey.[9] Dailey acknowledged the plagiarism and attributed it to a psychological disorder. She admitted that both Aspen Gold and Notorious lifted heavily from Roberts\\' work. Both of those novels were pulled from print after Dailey\\'s admission.[37][38] In April 1998, Dailey settled the case. Roberts donated the settlement to various literary causes including the Literacy Volunteers of America (now ProLiteracy).[9][39][40][41]\\nRoberts joined the chorus strongly criticizing fellow romance writer Cassie Edwards, who had lifted many passages from much older sources (many in the public domain) without giving credit, forcing Edwards out of the business.[42][43]\\nIn 2019 Roberts, along with other authors, was a victim of plagiarism by Cristiane Serruya.[44][45][46]\\nRoberts has been included repeatedly on the Giving Back Fund\\'s annual lists of the most philanthropic celebrities, with the bulk of her donations going to the Nora Roberts Foundation.[47][48][49] The foundation financially supports organizations that promote literacy and the arts, assist children and engage in humanitarian efforts. The Foundation also endowed the Nora Roberts Center for American Romance at McDaniel College, which supports academic scholarship on the American romance novel, with special emphasis on the literary qualities and significance of the romance.[50]\\nSeveral of Roberts\\' books have been adapted into made-for-TV movies and aired on Lifetime.\\nThe 2007 Collection featured:\\nThe 2009 Collection featured:[51]\\nPeter Guber\\'s Mandalay TV and Stephanie Germain Prods. produced the eight adaptations.\\nGolden Medallion awards were awarded by the Romance Writers of America.[52]\\nRITA Awards are awarded by the Romance Writers of America.[52]\\nQuill Awards are awarded by the Quills Foundation.[54]\\n',\n",

       " 'Margaret Eaton (née O\\'Neill, formerly Timberlake, later Buchignani; December 3, 1799 – November 8, 1879), was the wife of John Henry Eaton, a United States senator from Tennessee and United States Secretary of War, and a confidant of Andrew Jackson. Their marriage was the cause of a national controversy known as the Petticoat affair. While better known in history as Peggy, Margaret stated in her autobiography, \"I never was called Peggy in all my life...I was ordinarily called by my proper name of Margaret.\"[1]\\nMargaret O\\'Neill was the daughter of Rhoda Howell and William O\\'Neill,[2] the owner of Franklin House, a popular Washington, D.C., hotel. She had five siblings: William, Robert, John, Mary, and Georgianna.[1]\\nAs a girl, she was noted for her beauty, wit and vivacity.\\nWell-educated for her time and gender, she studied French and was known for her ability to play the piano.[3] William T. Barry, who later served as Postmaster General, wrote \"of a charming little girl...who very frequently plays the piano, and entertains us with agreeable songs.\" As a young girl, her reputation was already under scrutiny because she worked in a bar frequented by men and casually bantered with the boardinghouse clientele. An elderly Margaret reminisced that, \"While I was still in pantalets and rolling hoops with other girls I had the attention of men, young and old, enough to turn a girl\\'s head.\"[4]\\nAbout 1816, at age 17, Margaret O\\'Neill married John B. Timberlake, a 39-year-old purser in the Navy. Her parents gave them a house across from the hotel, and they met many politicians who stayed there. In 1818 they met and befriended John Henry Eaton, a 28-year-old widower and newly elected senator from Tennessee. Margaret and John Timberlake had three children: William (b. 1817; d. 1818); Mary Virginia (b. 1819); and Margaret Rose (1825–1855).[5][6]\\nJohn Timberlake died in 1828 while at sea in the Mediterranean, in service on a four-year voyage. Though the conventions of society required an extended mourning period, the widow Margaret Timberlake married Senator Eaton on January 1, 1829, just nine months after Timberlake\\'s death. As a result, rumors circulated that Timberlake had committed suicide because of despair at an alleged affair between his wife and Eaton. An autopsy concluded that Timberlake died of pneumonia brought on by pulmonary disease.\\nAfter John Eaton was appointed as Secretary of War, rumors continued and Margaret Eaton was snubbed by other cabinet wives. Her honor was defended by President Andrew Jackson, and she became the subject of the Petticoat affair, in which the wives of cabinet members and other prominent Washingtonians refused to pay social calls on the Eatons and refused them invitations to parties and other events.\\nJackson tried unsuccessfully to coerce the cabinet wives into ending their snubbing of the Eatons. Vice President John C. Calhoun, whose wife, Floride Calhoun, was seen as the anti-Eaton ringleader, supported his wife. This caused Jackson to transfer his favor to widower Martin Van Buren, the Secretary of State, who had taken the Eatons\\' side and shown positive social attention to Margaret. Van Buren helped end the Petticoat Affair by resigning, which gave Jackson the ability to remove his anti-Eaton cabinet members. Calhoun was not renominated for vice president and resigned shortly before the end of his term to accept election to the U.S. Senate. Van Buren became vice president in 1833, and was well-placed to become Jackson\\'s successor in 1837.\\nHistorian John F. Marszalek explained his view of the real reasons Washington society found Margaret unacceptable:\\nShe did not know her place; she forthrightly spoke up about anything that came to her mind, even topics of which women were supposed to be ignorant. She thrust herself into the world in a manner inappropriate for a woman...Accept her, and society was in danger of disruption. Accept this uncouth, impure, forward, worldly woman, and the wall of virtue and morality would be breached and society would have no further defenses against the forces of frightening change. Margaret Eaton was not that important in herself; it was what she represented that constituted the threat. Proper women had no choice; they had to prevent her acceptance into society as part of their defense of that society\\'s morality.Author Jon Meacham points out that Margaret Eaton\\'s life was unusual for its time. She was, according to Meacham \"by her own account...an outgoing flirt\" – her tongue was \"ungoverned, and ungovernable.\" He also points out that she craved attention: \"At various points in her life she was courted by an adjutant general, a major and a captain – which delighted her.\"\\nIn a memoir published long after her death, Margaret admitted to the accuracy of some of the characterizations of her: \"The fact is, I never had a lover who was not a gentleman and was not in a good position in society.\" \"I must have said a great many foolish things\" wrote Margaret, \"I am sure I did very few wise ones. I was foolish, hasty, but not vicious.\" Refusing to defend herself directly, Margaret Eaton expressed her opinion of her critics this way: \"I was quite as independent as they, and had more powerful friends...None of them had beauty, accomplishments or graces in society of any kind, and for these reasons...they were jealous of me.\"\\nMeacham observes that, \"it\\'s impossible...to assess the truth of the charges\" lodged by her enemies, but \"she offers this \"interesting defense\":\\n\"Just let a little commonsense be exercised. While I do not pretend to be a saint, and do not think I was ever very much stocked with sense, and lay no claim to be a model woman in any way, I put it to the candor of the world whether the slanders which have been uttered against me are to be believed.\"\\nThree years after the death of her second husband, Margaret Eaton married Antonio Gabriele Buchignani, an Italian music teacher and dancing master, on June 7, 1859.[7] She was 59 and he was in his mid-20s. The marriage reignited much of the social stigma Margaret had carried earlier in life.\\nIn 1866, their seventh year of marriage, Buchignani ran off to Europe with the bulk of his wife\\'s fortune as well as her 17-year-old granddaughter Emily E. Randolph. He married Randolph after he and Margaret divorced in 1869.[8][9][10][11]\\nAlthough Margaret Eaton obtained a divorce from Buchignani, she was not able to recover her financial standing. She died in poverty in Washington, D.C., on November 8, 1879, and was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery.[12][13]\\n',\n",

She was the first woman elected to Congress from Florida and just the second woman ever elected to the House from the American South, after Alice Mary Robertson of Oklahoma.[1] Owen became the first woman to earn a seat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.[2] A member of the Democratic Party, she was the first woman chief of mission at the minister rank in U.S. diplomatic history under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[3][4]\\nRuth Bryan was born on October 2, 1885, in Jacksonville, Illinois, to William Jennings Bryan and his wife Mary E. Baird. Ruth\\'s father was congressman and a three-time presidential candidate. Growing up Ruth had to move several times depending on her father\\'s work in politics. Ruth attended public schools in Washington, D.C., and the Monticello Female Academy in Godfrey, Illinois. In 1901 she began to take classes at the University of Nebraska.\\nIn 1903 Bryan dropped out of the University of Nebraska to marry William H. Leavitt, a well-known Newport, Rhode Island, portrait painter. The couple met when he was painting Bryan\\'s father\\'s portrait.[5] The couple had two children before divorcing in 1909.\\nBryan married Reginald Owen, a British Army officer, in 1910,[6] and had two more children with him. Her second husband died in 1928. She spent three years in Oracabessa, Jamaica, where she oversaw the design and construction of her home, Golden Clouds. It is now operated as a luxury villa. Owen kept her home in Jamaica for more than three decades and spent many winters there, particularly in later years when she lived in Denmark and New York City.  She detailed her time in Jamaica and experiences at Golden Clouds in her book, Caribbean Caravel.[7]\\nDuring World War I, Bryan served as a war nurse in the Voluntary Aid Detachment in the Egypt–Palestine campaign, 1915–1918. She also served as a secretary for the American Women\\'s War Relief Fund.[8][9]\\nRuth Bryan Owen was a female pioneer in the film industry. She was a director, producer, and screenwriter for a feature film in 1922, called Once Upon a Time/Scheherazade, which is now considered to be lost.[10] In the spring of 1921, she started production of Once Upon a Time.[10] The film featured the Community Players of Coconut Grove, Florida, and was not related to a major studio at the time.[11]\\nThe story line was said to revolve around a shah who is dethroned by his jealous subordinate, who in turn uses his new power to torture young women who do not amuse him. Towards the end, the sadistic ruler runs into the most beautiful one of all, and the exiled shah returns just in time to save the young woman from his nemesis. According to the Moving Picture World, the costuming was ornate and elaborately done, the staging was complicated, and the mise-en-scène evoked an \"atmosphere of experience in the Far East\".[10] Owen had done extensive traveling, and visited countries such as India, Burma, Sri Lanka, China and Japan. Inspired by these places, she used them as the backdrop for her film.\\nLittle would be known about the film except that Owen discussed it in correspondence with her friend, Carrie Dunlap. Dunlap was from Illinois and served as campaign treasurer for Ruth\\'s father William Jennings Bryan.[12] In her letters to Dunlap, Owen expresses great joy in her film, quoting, \"I can scarcely believe the film is mine when I see it \\'projected\\' on the wall above our fireplace.\"[13]\\nShe thought of herself as a true pioneer in the industry. Her correspondence with Dunlap also revealed her intent to become one of the first female filmmakers in the U.S. Owen funded the film solely from her earnings in the public speaker circuit. In her letters, Owen discussed the support she gained from the General Federation of Women\\'s Clubs, and their contribution to help secure a distribution deal with the Society for Visual Education.[10]\\nOwen first ran for office in 1926 for the Democratic nomination for Florida\\'s 4th congressional district. It was a year after the death of her father. It then included nearly the entire east coast of the state from Jacksonville to the Florida Keys: with Miami, Orlando and St. Augustine. She lost the primary by fewer than 800 votes to incumbent William J. Sears.[14]\\nFrom 1925 to 1928, she was an administrator at the University of Miami.\\nIn 1928, after the death of her husband, Owen ran again. Having played a significant role when a hurricane hit Miami in 1927 and put efforts into promotions in newspapers, she won over Sears by more than 14,000 votes[15] and was elected to Congress in November 1928 and began her term of office on March 4, 1929, while a widow and mother of four. Her election was contested on the grounds that she had lost her citizenship by marrying an alien. By the Cable Act in 1922, she could petition for her citizenship, which she did in 1925, less than the seven years required by the Constitution. She argued her case before the House Committee on Elections, saying that no American man had ever lost his citizenship by marriage.

By 1965 she had dropped the pseudonym and was signing her own name to all of her novels.[5]\\nThe breakthrough in Pilcher\\'s career came in 1987, when she wrote the family saga The Shell Seekers, her fourteenth novel under her own name.[10] It focuses on an elderly British woman, Penelope Keeling, who relives her life in flashbacks, and on her relationship with her adult children. Keeling\\'s life was not extraordinary, but it spans \"a time of huge importance and change in the world.\"[6] The novel describes the everyday details of what life during World War II was like for some of those who lived in Britain.[6] The Shell Seekers sold around ten million copies and was translated into more than forty languages.[2] It was adapted for the stage by Terence Brady and Charlotte Bingham.[8] Pilcher was said to be among the highest-earning women in Britain by the mid-1990s.[11]\\nHer other major novels include September (1990), Coming Home (1995) and Winter Solstice (2000).[10][12] Coming Home won the Romantic Novel of the Year Award by Romantic Novelists\\' Association in 1996.[13] The president of the association in 2019, the romance writer Katie Fforde, considers Pilcher to be \"groundbreaking as she was the first to bring family sagas to the wider public\".[10] Felicity Bryan, in her obituary for The Guardian, writes that Pilcher took the romance genre to \"an altogether higher, wittier level\"; she praises Pilcher\\'s work for its \"grittiness and fearless observation\" and comments that it is often more prosaic than romantic.[2]\\nPilcher retired from writing in 2000.[5] Two years later, in the 2002 New Year Honours, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to literature.[14][15]\\nHer books are especially popular in Germany because the national television station ZDF (Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen) has produced more than a hundred of her stories as TV movies, starting with The Day of the Storm in 1993.

       " '\\nEdgar Allan Poe (né\\xa0Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American writer, poet, author, editor, and literary critic who is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism and Gothic fiction in the United States, and of American literature.[1] Poe was one of the country\\'s earliest practitioners of the short story, and is considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre, as well as a significant contributor to the emerging genre of science fiction.[2] He is the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.[3]\\nPoe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Poe.[4] His father abandoned the family in 1810, and when his mother died the following year, Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood. He attended the University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money. He quarreled with John Allan over the funds for his education, and his gambling debts. In 1827, having enlisted in the United States Army under an assumed name, he published his first collection, Tamerlane and Other Poems, credited only to \"a Bostonian\". Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan\\'s wife in 1829. Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declared a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and parted ways with Allan.\\nPoe switched his focus to prose, and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move between several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In 1836, he married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia Clemm, but she died of tuberculosis in 1847. In January 1845, he published his poem \"The Raven\" to instant success. He planned for years to produce his own journal The Penn, later renamed The Stylus. But before it began publishing, Poe died in Baltimore in 1849, aged 40, under mysterious circumstances. The cause of his death remains unknown, and has been variously attributed to many causes including disease, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide.[5]\\nPoe and his works influenced literature around the world, as well as specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography. He and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums. The Mystery Writers of America present an annual Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.\\nEdgar Poe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 19, 1809, the second child of American actor David Poe Jr. and English-born actress Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe. He had an elder brother, Henry, and a younger sister, Rosalie.[6] Their grandfather, David Poe, had emigrated from County Cavan, Ireland, around 1750.[7]\\nHis father abandoned the family in 1810,[8] and his mother died a year later from pulmonary tuberculosis. Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful merchant in Richmond, Virginia, who dealt in a variety of goods, including cloth, wheat, tombstones, tobacco, and slaves.[9] The Allans served as a foster family and gave him the name \"Edgar Allan Poe\",[10] although they never formally adopted him.[11]\\nThe Allan family had Poe baptized into the Episcopal Church in 1812. John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son.[10] The family sailed to the United Kingdom in 1815, and Poe attended the grammar school for a short period in Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland, where Allan was born, before rejoining the family in London in 1816. There he studied at a boarding school in Chelsea until summer 1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransby\\'s Manor House School at Stoke Newington, then a suburb 4 miles (6\\xa0km) north of London.[12]\\nPoe moved with the Allans back to Richmond in 1820. In 1824, he served as the lieutenant of the Richmond youth honor guard as the city celebrated the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette.[13] In March 1825, Allan\\'s uncle and business benefactor William Galt died, who was said to be one of the wealthiest men in Richmond,[14] leaving Allan several acres of real estate. The inheritance was estimated at $750,000 (equivalent to $19,000,000 in 2022).[15] By summer 1825, Allan celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick house called Moldavia.[16]\\nPoe may have become engaged to Sarah Elmira Royster before he registered at the University of Virginia in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages.[17][18] The university was in its infancy, established on the ideals of its founder Thomas Jefferson. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were mostly ignored. Jefferson enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate.[19] During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. He claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe\\'s debts increased.[20] Poe gave up on the university after a year but did not feel welcome returning to Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married another man, Alexander Shelton. He traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer,[21] and started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet during this period.[22]\\nPoe was unable to support himself, so he enlisted in the United States Army as a private on May 27, 1827, using the name \"Edgar A. Perry\". He claimed that he was 22 years old even though he was 18.[23] He first served at Fort Independence in Boston Harbor for five dollars a month.[21] That year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry titled Tamerlane and Other Poems, attributed with the byline \"by a Bostonian\". Only 50 copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention.[24] Poe\\'s regiment was posted to Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South Carolina, and traveled by ship on the brig Waltham on November 8, 1827. Poe was promoted to \"artificer\", an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for artillery, and had his monthly pay doubled.[25] He served for two years and attained the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery, the highest rank that a non-commissioned officer could achieve; he then sought to end his five-year enlistment early. He revealed his real name and his circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Howard, who would allow Poe to be discharged only if he reconciled with Allan. Poe wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic and spent several months ignoring Poe\\'s pleas; Allan may not have written to Poe even to make him aware of his foster mother\\'s illness. Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829, and Poe visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife\\'s death, Allan agreed to support Poe\\'s attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.[26]\\nPoe was finally discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him.[27] Before entering West Point, he moved to Baltimore for a time to stay with his widowed aunt Maria Clemm, her daughter Virginia Eliza Clemm (Poe\\'s first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe.[28] In September of that year, Poe received \"the very first words of encouragement I ever remember to have heard\"[29] in a review of his poetry by influential critic John Neal, prompting Poe to dedicate one of the poems to Neal[30] in his second book Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems, published in Baltimore in 1829.[31]\\nPoe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830.[32] In October 1830, Allan married his second wife Louisa Patterson.[33] The marriage and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of extramarital affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe.[34] Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. He tactically pleaded not guilty to induce dismissal, knowing that he would be found guilty.[35]\\nPoe left for New York in February 1831 and released a third volume of poems, simply titled Poems. The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at West Point, many of whom donated 75 cents to the cause, raising a total of $170. They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones Poe had written about commanding officers.[36] It was printed by Elam Bliss of New York, labeled as \"Second Edition\", and including a page saying, \"To the U.S. Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated\". The book once again reprinted the long poems \"Tamerlane\" and \"Al Aaraaf\" but also six previously unpublished poems, including early versions of \"To Helen\", \"Israfel\", and \"The City in the Sea\".[37] Poe returned to Baltimore to his aunt, brother, and cousin in March 1831. His elder brother Henry had been in ill health, in part due to problems with alcoholism, and he died on August 1, 1831.[38]\\nAfter his brother\\'s death, Poe began more earnest attempts to start his career as a writer, but he chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so.[39] He was one of the first Americans to live by writing alone[3][40] and was hampered by the lack of an international copyright law.[41] American publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans.[40] The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837.[42] There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues.[43] Publishers often refused to pay their writers or paid them much later than they promised,[44] and Poe repeatedly resorted to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.[45]\\nAfter his early attempts at poetry, Poe had turned his attention to prose, likely based on John Neal\\'s critiques in The Yankee magazine.[46] He placed a few stories with a Philadelphia publication and began work on his only drama Politian. The Baltimore Saturday Visiter awarded him a prize in October 1833 for his short story \"MS. Found in a Bottle\".[47] The story brought him to the attention of John P. Kennedy, a Baltimorean of considerable means who helped Poe place some of his stories and introduced him to Thomas W. White, editor of the Southern Literary Messenger in Richmond.\\nIn 1835, Poe became assistant editor of the \\'Southern Literary Messenger,[48] but White discharged him within a few weeks for being drunk on the job.[49] Poe returned to Baltimore, where he obtained a license to marry his cousin Virginia on September 22, 1835, though it is unknown if they were married at that time.[50] He was 26 and she was 13.\\nPoe was reinstated by White after promising good behavior, and he returned to Richmond with Virginia and her mother. He remained at the Messenger until January 1837. During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500.[6] He published several poems, book reviews, critiques, and stories in the paper. On May 16, 1836, he and Virginia held a Presbyterian wedding ceremony performed by Amasa Converse at their Richmond boarding house, with a witness falsely attesting Clemm\\'s age as 21.[50][51]\\nIn 1838, Poe relocated to Philadelphia, where he lived at four different residences between 1838 and 1844, one of which at 532 N. 7th Street has been preserved as a National Historic Landmark.\\nThat same year, Poe\\'s novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket was published and widely reviewed.[52] In the summer of 1839, he became assistant editor of Burton\\'s Gentleman\\'s Magazine. He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing his reputation as a trenchant critic which he had established at the Messenger. Also in 1839, the collection Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque was published in two volumes, though he made little money from it and it received mixed reviews.[53]\\nIn June 1840, Poe published a prospectus announcing his intentions to start his own journal called The Stylus,[54] although he originally intended to call it The Penn, since it would have been based in Philadelphia. He bought advertising space for his prospectus in the June 6, 1840, issue of Philadelphia\\'s Saturday Evening Post: \"Prospectus of the Penn Magazine, a Monthly Literary journal to be edited and published in the city of Philadelphia by Edgar A. Poe.\"[55] The journal was never produced before Poe\\'s death.\\nPoe left Burton\\'s after about a year and found a position as writer and co-editor at Graham\\'s Magazine, a successful monthly publication.[56] In the last number of Graham\\'s for 1841, Poe was among the co-signatories to an editorial note of celebration of the tremendous success the magazine had achieved in the past year: \"Perhaps the editors of no magazine, either in America or in Europe, ever sat down, at the close of a year, to contemplate the progress of their work with more satisfaction than we do now. Our success has been unexampled, almost incredible. We may assert without fear of contradiction that no periodical ever witnessed the same increase during so short a period.\"[57]\\nAround this time, Poe attempted to secure a position in the administration of John Tyler, claiming that he was a member of the Whig Party.[58] He hoped to be appointed to the United States Custom House in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler\\'s son Robert,[59] an acquaintance of Poe\\'s friend Frederick Thomas.[60] Poe failed to show up for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas believed that he had been drunk.[61] Poe was promised an appointment, but all positions were filled by others.[62]\\nOne evening in January 1842, Virginia showed the first signs of consumption, or tuberculosis, while singing and playing the piano, which Poe described as breaking a blood vessel in her throat.[63] She only partially recovered, and Poe began to drink more heavily under the stress of her illness. He left Graham\\'s and attempted to find a new position, for a time angling for a government post. He returned to New York where he worked briefly at the Evening Mirror before becoming editor of the Broadway Journal, and later its owner.[64] There Poe alienated himself from other writers by publicly accusing Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of plagiarism, though Longfellow never responded.[65] On January 29, 1845, Poe\\'s poem \"The Raven\" appeared in the Evening Mirror and became a popular sensation. It made Poe a household name almost instantly,[66] though he was paid only $9 for its publication.[67] It was concurrently published in The American Review: A Whig Journal under the pseudonym \"Quarles\".[68]\\nThe Broadway Journal failed in 1846,[64] and Poe moved to a cottage in Fordham, New York, in the Bronx. That home, now known as the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage, was relocated in later years to a park near the southeast corner of the Grand Concourse and Kingsbridge Road. Nearby, Poe befriended the Jesuits at St. John\\'s College, now Fordham University.[69] Virginia died at the cottage on January 30, 1847.[70] Biographers and critics often suggest that Poe\\'s frequent theme of the \"death of a beautiful woman\" stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his life, including his wife.[71]\\nPoe was increasingly unstable after his wife\\'s death. He attempted to court poet Sarah Helen Whitman, who lived in Providence, Rhode Island. Their engagement failed, purportedly because of Poe\\'s drinking and erratic behavior. There is also strong evidence that Whitman\\'s mother intervened and did much to derail the relationship.[72] Poe then returned to Richmond and resumed a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster.[73]\\nOn October 3, 1849, Poe was found semiconscious in Baltimore, \"in great distress, and... in need of immediate assistance\", according to Joseph W. Walker, who found him.[74] He was taken to the Washington Medical College, where he died on Sunday, October 7, 1849, at 5:00 in the morning.[75] Poe was not coherent long enough to explain how he came to be in his dire condition and why he was wearing clothes that were not his own. He is said to have repeatedly called out the name \"Reynolds\" on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring. His attending physician said that Poe\\'s final words were, \"Lord help my poor soul\".[75] All of the relevant medical records have been lost, including Poe\\'s death certificate.[76]\\nNewspapers at the time reported Poe\\'s death as \"congestion of the brain\" or \"cerebral inflammation\", common euphemisms for death from disreputable causes such as alcoholism.[77] The actual cause of death remains a mystery.[78] Speculation has included delirium tremens, heart disease, epilepsy, syphilis, meningeal inflammation,[5] cholera,[79] carbon monoxide poisoning,[80] and rabies.[81] One theory dating from 1872 suggests that Poe\\'s death resulted from cooping, a form of electoral fraud in which citizens were forced to vote for a particular candidate, sometimes leading to violence and even murder.[82]\\nImmediately after Poe\\'s death, his literary rival Rufus Wilmot Griswold wrote a slanted high-profile obituary under a pseudonym, filled with falsehoods that cast Poe as a lunatic, and which described him as a person who \"walked the streets, in madness or melancholy, with lips moving in indistinct curses, or with eyes upturned in passionate prayers, (never for himself, for he felt, or professed to feel, that he was already damned)\".[83]\\nThe long obituary appeared in the New York Tribune, signed \"Ludwig\" on the day that Poe was buried in Baltimore. It was further published throughout the country. The obituary began, \"Edgar Allan Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore the day before yesterday. This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved by it.\"[84] \"Ludwig\" was soon identified as Griswold, an editor, critic, and anthologist who had borne a grudge against Poe since 1842. Griswold somehow became Poe\\'s literary executor and attempted to destroy his enemy\\'s reputation after his death.[85]\\nGriswold wrote a biographical article of Poe called \"Memoir of the Author\", which he included in an 1850 volume of the collected works. There he depicted Poe as a depraved, drunken, drug-addled madman and included Poe\\'s letters as evidence.[85] Many of his claims were either lies or distortions; for example, it is seriously disputed that Poe was a drug addict.[86] Griswold\\'s book was denounced by those who knew Poe well,[87] including John Neal, who published an article defending Poe and attacking Griswold as a \"Rhadamanthus, who is not to be bilked of his fee, a thimble-full of newspaper notoriety\".[88] Griswold\\'s book nevertheless became a popularly accepted biographical source. This was in part because it was the only full biography available and was widely reprinted, and in part because readers thrilled at the thought of reading works by an \"evil\" man.[89] Letters that Griswold presented as proof were later revealed as forgeries.[90]\\nPoe\\'s best-known fiction works are Gothic horror,[91] adhering to the genre\\'s conventions to appeal to the public taste.[92] His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning.[93] Many of his works are generally considered part of the dark romanticism genre, a literary reaction to transcendentalism[94] which Poe strongly disliked.[95] He referred to followers of the transcendental movement as \"Frog-Pondians\", after the pond on Boston Common,[96][97] and ridiculed their writings as \"metaphor—run mad,\"[98] lapsing into \"obscurity for obscurity\\'s sake\" or \"mysticism for mysticism\\'s sake\".[95] Poe once wrote in a letter to Thomas Holley Chivers that he did not dislike transcendentalists, \"only the pretenders and sophists among them\".[99]\\nBeyond horror, Poe also wrote satires, humor tales, and hoaxes. For comic effect, he used irony and ludicrous extravagance, often in an attempt to liberate the reader from cultural conformity.[92] \"Metzengerstein\" is the first story that Poe is known to have published[100] and his first foray into horror, but it was originally intended as a burlesque satirizing the popular genre.[101] Poe also reinvented science fiction, responding in his writing to emerging technologies such as hot air balloons in \"The Balloon-Hoax\".[102]\\nPoe wrote much of his work using themes aimed specifically at mass-market tastes.[103] To that end, his fiction often included elements of popular pseudosciences, such as phrenology[104] and physiognomy.[105]\\nPoe\\'s writing reflects his literary theories, which he presented in his criticism and also in essays such as \"The Poetic Principle\".[106] He disliked didacticism[107] and allegory,[108] though he believed that meaning in literature should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface. Works with obvious meanings, he wrote, cease to be art.[109] He believed that work of quality should be brief and focus on a specific single effect.[106] To that end, he believed that the writer should carefully calculate every sentiment and idea.[110]\\nPoe describes his method in writing \"The Raven\" in the essay \"The Philosophy of Composition\", and he claims to have strictly followed this method. It has been questioned whether he really followed this system, however. T.\\xa0S. Eliot said: \"It is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method.\"[111] Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as \"a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization\".[112]\\nDuring his lifetime, Poe was mostly recognized as a literary critic. Fellow critic James Russell Lowell called him \"the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America\", suggesting—rhetorically—that he occasionally used prussic acid instead of ink.[113] Poe\\'s caustic reviews earned him the reputation of being a \"tomahawk man\".[114] A favorite target of Poe\\'s criticism was Boston\\'s acclaimed poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was often defended by his literary friends in what was later called \"The Longfellow War\". Poe accused Longfellow of \"the heresy of the didactic\", writing poetry that was preachy, derivative, and thematically plagiarized.[115] Poe correctly predicted that Longfellow\\'s reputation and style of poetry would decline, concluding, \"We grant him high qualities, but deny him the Future\".[116]\\nPoe was also known as a writer of fiction and became one of the first American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States.[117] Poe is particularly respected in France, in part due to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire\\'s translations became definitive renditions of Poe\\'s work in Continental Europe.[118]\\nPoe\\'s early detective fiction tales featuring C. Auguste Dupin laid the groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, \"Each [of Poe\\'s detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\"[119] The Mystery Writers of America have named their awards for excellence in the genre the \"Edgars\".[120] Poe\\'s work also influenced science fiction, notably Jules Verne, who wrote a sequel to Poe\\'s novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket called An Antarctic Mystery, also known as The Sphinx of the Ice Fields.[121] Science fiction author H.\\xa0G. Wells noted, \"Pym tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago\".[122] In 2013, The Guardian cited Pym as one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language, and noted its influence on later authors such as Doyle, Henry James, B. Traven, and David Morrell.[123]\\nHorror author and historian H. P. Lovecraft was heavily influenced by Poe\\'s horror tales, dedicating an entire section of his long essay, \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\", to his influence on the genre.[124] In his letters, Lovecraft described Poe as his \"God of Fiction\".[125] Lovecraft\\'s earlier stories express a significant influence from Poe.[126] A later work, At the Mountains of Madness, quotes him and was influenced by The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket.[127] Lovecraft also made extensive use of Poe\\'s unity of effect in his fiction.[128] Alfred Hitchcock once said, \"It\\'s because I liked Edgar Allan Poe\\'s stories so much that I began to make suspense films\".[129] Many references to Poe\\'s works are present in Vladimir Nabokov\\'s novels.[130]\\nLike many famous artists, Poe\\'s works have spawned imitators.[131] One trend among imitators of Poe has been claims by clairvoyants or psychics to be \"channeling\" poems from Poe\\'s spirit. One of the most notable of these was Lizzie Doten, who published Poems from the Inner Life in 1863, in which she claimed to have \"received\" new compositions by Poe\\'s spirit. The compositions were re-workings of famous Poe poems such as \"The Bells\", but which reflected a new, positive outlook.[132]\\nPoe has also received criticism. This is partly because of the negative perception of his personal character and its influence upon his reputation.[117] William Butler Yeats was occasionally critical of Poe and once called him \"vulgar\".[133] Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson reacted to \"The Raven\" by saying, \"I see nothing in it\",[134] and derisively referred to Poe as \"the jingle man\".[135] Aldous Huxley wrote that Poe\\'s writing \"falls into vulgarity\" by being \"too poetical\"—the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger.[136]\\nIt is believed that only twelve copies have survived of Poe\\'s first book Tamerlane and Other Poems. In December 2009, one copy sold at Christie\\'s auctioneers in New York City for $662,500, a record price paid for a work of American literature.[137]\\nEureka: A Prose Poem, an essay written in 1848, included a cosmological theory that presaged the Big Bang theory by 80 years,[138][139] as well as the first plausible solution to Olbers\\' paradox.[140][141]\\nPoe eschewed the scientific method in Eureka and instead wrote from pure intuition.[142] For this reason, he considered it a work of art, not science,[142] but insisted that it was still true[143] and considered it to be his career masterpiece.[144] Even so, Eureka is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe\\'s suggestions ignored Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets.[145]\\nPoe had a keen interest in cryptography. He had placed a notice of his abilities in the Philadelphia paper Alexander\\'s Weekly (Express) Messenger, inviting submissions of ciphers which he proceeded to solve.[146] In July 1841, Poe had published an essay called \"A Few Words on Secret Writing\" in Graham\\'s Magazine. Capitalizing on public interest in the topic, he wrote \"The Gold-Bug\" incorporating ciphers as an essential part of the story.[147] Poe\\'s success with cryptography relied not so much on his deep knowledge of that field (his method was limited to the simple substitution cryptogram) as on his knowledge of the magazine and newspaper culture. His keen analytical abilities, which were so evident in his detective stories, allowed him to see that the general public was largely ignorant of the methods by which a simple substitution cryptogram can be solved, and he used this to his advantage.[146] The sensation that Poe created with his cryptography stunts played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines.[148]\\nTwo ciphers he published in 1841 under the name \"W.\\xa0B. Tyler\" were not solved until 1992 and 2000 respectively. One was a quote from Joseph Addison\\'s play Cato; the other is probably based on a poem by Hester Thrale.[149][150]\\nPoe had an influence on cryptography beyond increasing public interest during his lifetime. William Friedman, America\\'s foremost cryptologist, was heavily influenced by Poe.[151] Friedman\\'s initial interest in cryptography came from reading \"The Gold-Bug\" as a child, an interest that he later put to use in deciphering Japan\\'s PURPLE code during World War\\xa0II.[152]\\nThe historical Edgar Allan Poe has appeared as a fictionalized character, often in order to represent the \"mad genius\" or \"tormented artist\" and in order to exploit his personal struggles.[153] Many such depictions also blend in with characters from his stories, suggesting that Poe and his characters share identities.[154] Often, fictional depictions of Poe use his mystery-solving skills in such novels as The Poe Shadow by Matthew Pearl.[155]\\n\\nNo childhood home of Poe is still standing, including the Allan family\\'s Moldavia estate. The oldest standing home in Richmond, the Old Stone House, is in use as the Edgar Allan Poe Museum, though Poe never lived there. The collection includes many items that Poe used during his time with the Allan family, and also features several rare first printings of Poe works. 13 West Range is the dorm room that Poe is believed to have used while studying at the University of Virginia in 1826; it is preserved and available for visits. Its upkeep is overseen by a group of students and staff known as the Raven Society.[156]\\nThe earliest surviving home in which Poe lived is at 203 North Amity St. in Baltimore, which is preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum. Poe is believed to have lived in the home at the age of 23 when he first lived with Maria Clemm and Virginia and possibly his grandmother and possibly his brother William Henry Leonard Poe.[157] It is open to the public and is also the home of the Edgar Allan Poe Society.\\nWhile in Philadelphia between 1838 and 1844, Poe lived at at least four different residences, including the Indian Queen Hotel at 15 S. 4th Street, at a residence at 16th and Locust Streets, at 2502 Fairmount Street, and then in the Spring Garden section of the city at 532 N. 7th Street, a residence that has been preserved by the National Park Service as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site.[158][159] Poe\\'s final home in Bronx, New York City, is preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage.[70]\\nIn Boston, a commemorative plaque on Boylston Street is several blocks away from the actual location of Poe\\'s birth.[160][161][162][163] The house which was his birthplace at 62 Carver Street no longer exists; also, the street has since been renamed \"Charles Street South\".[164][163] A \"square\" at the intersection of Broadway, Fayette, and Carver Streets had once been named in his honor,[165] but it disappeared when the streets were rearranged. In 2009, the intersection of Charles and Boylston Streets (two blocks north of his birthplace) was designated \"Edgar Allan Poe Square\".[166]\\nIn March 2014, fundraising was completed for construction of a permanent memorial sculpture, known as Poe Returning to Boston, at this location. The winning design by Stefanie Rocknak depicts a life-sized Poe striding against the wind, accompanied by a flying raven; his suitcase lid has fallen open, leaving a \"paper trail\" of literary works embedded in the sidewalk behind him.[167][168][169] The public unveiling on October 5, 2014, was attended by former U.S. poet laureate Robert Pinsky.[170]\\nOther Poe landmarks include a building on the Upper West Side, where Poe temporarily lived when he first moved to New York City. A plaque suggests that Poe wrote \"The Raven\" here. On Sullivan\\'s Island in Charleston County, South Carolina, the setting of Poe\\'s tale \"The Gold-Bug\" and where Poe served in the Army in 1827 at Fort Moultrie, there is a restaurant called Poe\\'s Tavern. In the Fell\\'s Point section of Baltimore, a bar still stands where legend says that Poe was last seen drinking before his death. Known as \"The Horse You Came in On\", local lore insists that a ghost whom they call \"Edgar\" haunts the rooms above.[171]\\nEarly daguerreotypes of Poe continue to arouse great interest among literary historians.[172] Notable among them are:\\nBetween 1949 and 2009, a bottle of cognac and three roses were left at Poe\\'s original grave marker every January 19 by an unknown visitor affectionately referred to as the \"Poe Toaster\". Sam Porpora was a historian at the Westminster Church in Baltimore, where Poe is buried; he claimed on August 15, 2007, that he had started the tradition in 1949. Porpora said that the tradition began in order to raise money and enhance the profile of the church. His story has not been confirmed,[173] and some details which he gave to the press are factually inaccurate.[174] The Poe Toaster\\'s last appearance was on January 19, 2009, the day of Poe\\'s bicentennial.[175]\\nShort stories\\nPoetry\\nOther works\\n Category\\n',\n",

Allen; Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Averil Ives, Anita Charles, Barbara Rowan, Jane Beaufort, Rose Burghley, Mary Whistler and Marguerite Bell. She has sold millions of copies over her 90-year career. She has been referred to as the \"world\\'s oldest novelist\" who was still active at 105 and continued writing until her death.[2] On the occasion of her 105th birthday, Pollock was appointed honorary vice-president of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association, having been one of its founding members.[3]\\nIda and her husband, Lt Colonel Hugh Alexander Pollock, DSO (1888–1971), a veteran of war and Winston Churchill\\'s collaborator and editor, had a daughter, Rosemary Pollock, who was also a romance writer. Ida\\'s autobiography, Starlight, published in 2009 at 100 years, tells the story of the start of her career, her marriage, and the relation of her husband with his ex-wife Enid Blyton. She was also an oil painter, who was selected for inclusion in a national exhibition in 2004, at the age of 96.[4]\\nBorn Ida Julia Crowe on 12 April 1908 in Lewisham, Kent, England,[5] she was the daughter of Fanny Osborn, whose father was an architect in Victorian London, and her husband Arthur Crowe, but Pollock claimed to be illegitimate.[6] Still unmarried, her mother began an affair with a supposed Russian duke, but, after her parents\\' death, her mother married Arthur Crowe, an old widower with a distant connection to Lord Nelson. A year or so later her mother resumed her affair with her Russian lover and became pregnant, but her daughter obtained her husband\\'s surname.[6] Her mother lived alone when Pollock was born, and she narrowly escaped being smothered with a pillow by the nurse who attended her birth.[7] Her mother had a difficult time raising her and she was almost adopted by a rich uncle.[6] Encouraged by her mother, she began to write while still at school. At 14, she published her first thriller, The Hills of Raven\\'s Haunt.[citation needed]\\nAt age 20, she was living with her mother in Hastings and already had several stories in major magazines and short novels in print.[8] She visited George Newnes\\'s office in London, to sell her first full-length manuscript;[7] Palanquins and Coloured Lanterns, a novel set in 1920s Shanghai.[8] Six months later, she discovered they had mislaid it.[9] After they found it, she returned to London to meet one of its editors, the 39-year-old Hugh Alexander Pollock (1888–1971), a distinguished veteran of World War I. Hugh had been married since 1924 to his second wife, the popular children\\'s writer Enid Blyton, and was divorced from his first wife, Marion Atkinson, with whom he had two sons, William Cecil Alexander (1914–16) and Edward Alistair (1915–69). George Newnes bought her manuscript and contracted with her to write two more novels.[7] She became a full-time writer in the 1930s, writing short stories under pseudonyms. Ida decided to travel alone to Morocco, after suffering a mental breakdown.[7]\\nDuring World War II, Ida worked at a hostel for girls in London during the Blitz; at this time Hugh, who had left publishing to join the Army, was Commandant of a school for Home Guard officers.[10] Hugh had two daughters with Enid Blyton, Gillian Mary (later Baverstock; 1931–2007) and Imogen Mary (later Smallwood; born 1935), but his marriage had difficulties and his wife began a series of affairs. He offered Ida a post as civilian secretary at the Army Training Centre in the Surrey Hills. During a bungled firearms training session on a firing range, Hugh was hit by shrapnel and Ida contacted Enid, who declined to visit her husband because she was busy and hated hospitals.[7]\\nIn 1941, Enid met Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters, a London surgeon with whom she began another relationship, and the marriage had broken down. In May 1942, while Ida was visiting her mother\\'s home in Hastings a bomb destroyed the house. She escaped unhurt, but her mother was in hospital for two weeks.[7] Hugh paid for Ida to stay at Claridges and he said he was divorcing his wife. To get a quick divorce, Hugh blamed himself for adultery at divorce petition. On 26 October 1943 Ida and Hugh were married at London\\'s Guildhall Register Office, six days after Enid\\'s marriage to Darrell Waters. In 1944 they had a daughter Rosemary Pollock who has also become a romance writer. Enid changed the names of their daughters and Hugh did not see them again, although Enid had promised access as part of his taking the blame for the divorce.[citation needed]\\nAfter World War II, George Newnes, Hugh\\'s old firm, decided not to work with him anymore. They also represented Enid Blyton and were not willing to let her go. After this the marriage experienced financial problems and, in 1950, Hugh had to declare bankruptcy while he struggled with alcoholism. Ida decided to write popular contemporary romances and sold her first novel to Mills & Boon in 1952. Being in print with several major international publishers at the same time, she decided to use multiple pseudonyms. In the 1950s she wrote as Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Rose Burghley, and Mary Whistler to Mills & Boon; as Averil Ives and Barbara Rowan to Ward Lock; as Anita Charles to Wright & Brown; and as Jane Beaufort to Collins. In 1964, she published under her married name, Ida Pollock, her first historical novel, The Gentle Masquerade, and after the success of it, Mills and Boon\\'s \"Masquerade\" series of historical romances was launched.[8] Under her last pseudonym, Marguerite Bell, she also wrote historical romances. Most of her novels have been reprinted by Mills & Boon (or Harlequin in the United States).\\nDuring her marriage she travelled widely and lived in many parts of England. It was their daughter\\'s asthma that brought the Pollocks to Cornwall. They also lived in Ireland, France, Italy, Malta and Switzerland, where they successfully obtained a lasting cure for Rosemary\\'s debilitating condition.[7] Hugh died on 8 November 1971 in Malta, where he is buried in the British military cemetery. After her husband\\'s death, Pollock returned with her daughter to England and they lived for several years in Wiltshire, before moving to Lanreath in 1986. In the 1970s she slowed the rhythm of publication, but continued to write. Besides romances, she published – as Barbara Rowan – a suspense novel, and her novel, A Distant Drum (2005), is based around the Battle of Waterloo. She has been referred to as the \"world\\'s oldest novelist\" who was still active at 105.[11] After her death, her medieval story: Sir Faintheart was published in 2015, and there are still at least two unpublished Regency romances pending publication, including The Runaway.[2]  Today many of her old novels are being reedited.\\nIn addition to writing, Ida constructed model houses, usually scale miniatures of Georgian or Tudor buildings. She was also an oil painter, who was selected for inclusion in a national exhibition in 2004, at the age of 96.[8] But her sight deteriorated and she returned to writing.\\nAfter her 100th birthday, her autobiography, Starlight, was published on 15 November 2009, and she tells the story of the start of her career, her marriage, and the relation of her husband with his ex-wife Enid Blyton.\\nIn 1960 she was a founding member of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association, and in 2010 she helped in its 50th anniversary.[7] On the occasion of her 105th birthday, she was appointed its honorary vice-president.\\nShe died 3 December 2013, aged 105.[12]\\n(* Novels reedited as Ida Pollock)\\n(* Novels reedited as Ida Pollock)\\n',\n",

       " '\\nElizabeth Power (born 1941) is an English actress. Power began her career in repertory theatre and went on to appear in several West End musicals. However, she is best known for her work on British television, in particular her role as Christine Hewitt in the BBC soap opera, EastEnders (1992–1993). She has since gone on to feature in various stage productions.\\nPower was born in Eastbourne, East Sussex. She began singing and dancing lessons at the age of four, prompted by her mother, who was very keen for her to perform. However, at the age of 14, Power concluded \"that she wasn\\'t physically suited to be a dancer\", so she decided to take up acting on the advice of her teacher. Power auditioned for a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) at the age of 17, and was accepted. She has commented \"I just glided into it so I was still naive…Rada was good and I realised there was more than just going on stage and being clapped.\"[1] Power graduated from RADA in 1966.\\nPower began her acting career on stage, appearing at a young age as Alison in a revival of the Slade-Reynolds Christmas musical, The Merry Gentleman, at the Bristol Old Vic in 1959.[2] After leaving RADA in 1966, she worked for 18 months at the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry.[2] She had various roles in repertory theatre during her early career, and has since commented: \"I got lots of jobs in rep, learning my craft and playing totally unsuitable roles—old ladies and the sort of stuff you did in those days.\"[1]\\nPower went on to appear in various West End musicals. In 1969 she played the leading role, Lucy, in Two Cities, a British musical about the Charles Dickens story A Tale of Two Cities, which played at the Palace Theatre, London. She later toured in a production of The Pajama Game, and in 1972 she played Avonia Bunn in the Julian Slade musical, Trelawny, which was based on the Pinero play Trelawny of the Wells. The show opened at the Bristol Old Vic, then transferred to Sadler\\'s Wells Theatre and later the Prince of Wales Theatre, with Power staying for its entire run. In 1974 she was cast in the revue Cole, built around the songs of Cole Porter, which played at the Mermaid Theatre. The following year she appeared in So Who Needs Marriage?, a musical written by Monty Norman, which toured for a few weeks in May 1975. So Who Needs Marriage? ended uo being Power\\'s \"swansong\" in musicals.[2] She has since commented that the musicals of the late 1960s and early 1970s were not the sort of shows that suited her vocal talents: \"The musicals were mainly American imports. If you didn\\'t have that big chesty voice, there was no place for you…\"[1]\\nPower switched to television acting in the 1970s. One of her first television roles was in the BBC science fiction series Doctor Who and the Silurians in 1970.

Mrs Hewitt was going to be in five episodes and I thought, \\'wonderful\\'.\"[1] Mrs Hewitt made her first appearance on-screen in February 1992, as a lonely divorcee who employed the long running character, Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), to tend to her garden—used as a plot device to rebuild Arthur\\'s relationship with his son Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), while they worked together on Christine\\'s garden.[3] Power filmed her scenes for the five episodes and thought that would be the end of it; however, she was subsequently contacted by Leonard Lewis and asked to reprise the role. Power commented \"It was all I could do to stop myself screeching down the phone. They didn\\'t tell me which direction the story was going to take. I got on so well with [Bill Treacher] from the word go. We really liked each other.\"[1] Mrs Hewitt was reintroduced in a storyline that saw her become Arthur Fowler\\'s mistress, but when the affair ended Power left the series, making her final appearance on-screen in October 1993.\\nPower has subsequently appeared in the horror film Tale of the Mummy (1998), a role that reunited her with actor Bill Treacher on-screen as husband and wife. Power and Treacher were offered the parts by director Russell Mulcahy, who was an \"avid fan\" of them in EastEnders. Power has commented \"[Russell Mulcahy] was in Hollywood but used to get friends to video the Arthur and Mrs Hewitt scenes. So he thought it would be a good idea to get us together again. He thought it would be a great joke. We played a caretaker and his wife.\"[1] Power has also appeared twice in the BBC medical soap Doctors (2001; 2004), but she has been most active in theatre rather than television post EastEnders.[1] She appeared in Alan Bennett\\'s Habeas Corpus at Farnham in 1993, and in 2001 she starred in Richard Harris\\' award-winning comedy Stepping Out, as a stern piano teacher, Mrs Fraser. She lent her skills to the International Festival of Musical Theatre in Cardiff in 2002, and starred in Trevor Baxter\\'s adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray, which toured the UK in 2003.[4][5]\\nPower lives in Surrey and is a mother of two. She married the British television personality, Michael Aspel, in 1977. Their marriage ended in 1994. She is a skilled dancer and piano player, and has used both skills on stage in various productions including Stepping Out.[1]\\n',\n",

       " '\\nEvadne Price (28 August 1888 – 17 April 1985), probably born Eva Grace Price, was an Australian-British writer, actress, astrologer and media personality. She also wrote under the pseudonym Helen Zenna Smith.\\nShe is now best remembered for her World War I novel Not So Quiet (published in America as Stepdaughters of War) which adapts the style of Erich Maria Remarque\\'s All Quiet on the Western Front to depict the experiences of British female ambulance drivers. During her lifetime she was known for her many romance novels, some of which were serialised in national newspapers, as well as for her children\\'s books starring the popular character Jane Turpin. In the 1950s, she became a regular performer on television, as a storyteller and astrologer. For 25 years she published a monthly astrology column in SHE magazine.\\nEvadne Price\\'s own account of her early life is full of contradictions. There is considerable evidence that she was born Eva Grace Price on 28 August 1888 in Merewether, New South Wales, Australia (NSW Registry of BDM cert. no. 1888/032162). In \"SHE Stargazes\" Evadne gives her birth date as 28 August (p.\\xa082). Evadne\\'s claim to have British parents is also unreliable, as BDM records show that they were both born in NSW, Australia. Her father, Jonathan Dixon Price, was a miner. He died in 1921, not, as Evadne claimed, during her teens.\\nThe Oxford Dictionary of National Biography follows the Times obituarist[2] in accepting her own claim that she was born at sea in 1896[3][4] but there is no birth certificate to support this, and she can not be found in the 1901 or 1911 British census listings. In the 1921 census, however, Evadne Grace Lynn Price, actress, gives her birthplace as New South Wales (but gives her age as 26). \\nThe article \"Newcastle Girl is Film Writer\" (Newcastle Morning Herald, 20 June 1939, p.\\xa06) reports that Evadne Price/Helen Zenna Smith was born in Merewether and attended the Junction School in Merewether.\\nIn July 1902 Eva Price obtained a bursary at the Maitland High School and in 1903 she attended the Largs Public School near Maitland. She performed in the end-of-year school concerts at these establishments, giving recitations (as reported in the Maitland Daily Mercury).\\nIn her late teens Eva Price was familiar to Newcastle audiences as an elocutionist.\\nIn 1908 Eva Price played the First Twin in Australia\\'s first production of \"Peter Pan\".\\nOn her 21st birthday, 28 August 1909, Eva Grace Price, actress, daughter of Jonathan Dixon Price, married a German-born actor Henry A. Dabelstein in Sydney (NSW Registry of BDM cert. no. 1909/007059). Henry used the stage name Harry Preston.\\nIn 1910 Price left Australia for London. Unable to find work there she went on to New York where she found a job in a burlesque variety show. She returned to the UK in 1912 advertising herself in The Stage newspaper as Miss Eva Price (Mrs Harry A. Preston). Harry started a new life in the USA calling himself Robert Harry Preston. US Draft Registration Cards for 1917-1918 and 1942 show him living in New York where, according to the US Social Security Death Index, he died in October 1972.\\nFrom 1912 to 1916 Price secured roles in provincial tours of dramatic productions: The Girl Who Knew A Bit (1912), Mr Wu (1914), Oh I Say (1915), Within The Law (1916).[5] In 1915 she changed \"Eva\" to the more evocative \"Evadne\" (Dumfries & Galloway Standard, 25 August 1915 p.\\xa03) and invented a new persona for herself, claiming to have been born at sea of British parents and considerably understating her age.\\nIn 1917-1918 Price is reported to have worked in the Air Ministry where she probably met Dorothy Fletcher, the sister of her second husband-to-be, Charles Alexander Fletcher. He was a son of Canon Edward Sumner Bicknell Fletcher, Rector of Kibworth. The couple married in 1920. Price claimed to be a spinster on the GRO registration form. Fletcher was a Captain in the Devonshire Regiment. After the war he was appointed to a government post in the Sudan. He died there in 1924 from blackwater fever. On the 1921 census form Evadne Price had listed her marital status as \\'single\\'. No records of a divorce from her first husband can be found so she probably kept her second marriage secret to avoid being discovered committing bigamy.\\nPrice resumed her stage career in 1919 until 1923 when she turned to journalism.\\nIn 1939 Evadne Fletcher married the Australian writer, Kenneth Andrew Attiwill alias Ken Attiwill (1906-1992) in Kent, England. The couple co-wrote a number of books and plays. They also later wrote scripts for the British television soap-opera Crossroads.[6]\\nShe was the war correspondent for The People from 1943, covering the Allied invasion of Europe and many major war stories, including the Nuremberg Trials. She was the first woman journalist to enter the Belsen concentration camp. Her husband was a prisoner of war in Japan, and was presumed dead for two years.\\nAs a journalist, Evadne wrote a column for the Sunday Chronicle and contributed to other newspapers. She also began contributing short stories to the fiction magazines of the period. Many of these are comic, and her most notable successes were the Jane Turpin stories, about a female equivalent of Richmal Crompton\\'s William. These were published in the Novel magazine from 1928, and then in books, beginning with Just Jane (1928). There were ten collections of Jane stories, finishing with Jane at War (1947). Price, however, did not take kindly to Jane stories being referred to as a copy of the William series. She went on record saying she \"had never heard of William\", even though William stories were regularly advertised on Jane book dust jackets.\\nThe famous illustrator Thomas Henry illustrated both Jane and William books, but signed the illustrations for the Jane books as \"Marriott\", to distinguish the two series.\\nIn 1930, Albert E. Marriott, who had recently started a publishing company, asked Evadne Price, who was known for her skill at pastiche, to write a parodic version of Erich Maria Remarque\\'s All Quiet on the Western Front, featuring women at war; his suggested title was All Quaint on the Western Front. By her own account she took Remarque\\'s book home to read and decided: \\'Anyone who wants a skit on this book wants their brains dusted.\\'.[7] She told him that he should publish an authentic account of women at war, and he asked her to write it, despite her protests that she was too young to know anything about the war. He offered her £50 if she could bring him 20,000 words by Monday morning.[7] Through an acquaintance she met Winifred Constance Young, who had been a wartime ambulance driver. Young lent Price her wartime diary, and the 20,000 words were written in less than forty-eight hours. Price recounts that Marriott was so delighted with her work that he immediately took the carbon copy to the News of the World, who paid him £5000.[7] It is likely that in making this deal he represented the writing as a first-hand account rather than a piece of historical fiction. If there was dishonesty or misrepresentation, there is no direct proof that Evadne Price was actively complicit in it; late in life, in an interview, she presented herself as a complete innocent manipulated by Marriott.[7]\\nThe book Not So Quiet... was published as by Helen Zenna Smith, which was also the name of its central character. The book\\'s jacket presents it as: \\'An honest, unsentimental, savage record of a girl ambulance driver in France.\\' and claims: \\'This is not a story.\\' These claims for authenticity persuaded reviewers to treat the book as a record of the author\\'s own experience. The Manchester Guardian critic wrote: \\'The author was attached to a convoy under the command of a domineering and heartless commandant, where the drivers suffered every discomfort of bad food, lack of sleep, dirt and petty tyranny.\\'[8]\\nThe book was an immediate success, and Marriott employed young women to drive around London in ambulances to publicise it.[7] It was translated into French as Pas Si Calme and published by Gallimard, Paris in 1931. It was translated into Spanish as Hay novedad en el frente...: (Hijastras de Guerra), in 1935. In the Netherlands it and two sequels were translated as a trilogy:  Gij vrouwen....!, Vrouwen in nood and Vrouwenroeping. In Germany she was compared to Adrienne Thomas, whose book, Katrin becomes a soldier was published in 1930.\\nShortly after the publication of Not So Quiet..., according to Evadne Price\\'s later account, the publisher Albert E. Marriott committed fraud by forging a letter on Buckingham Palace notepaper claiming to have the rights to Queen Mary\\'s memoirs. He sold these to the Daily Mail for a considerable advance, and then absconded.[7] According to her own account, it was only at this time that she discovered that \\'Albert E. Marriott\\' was a pseudonym of Netley Lucas, a career criminal.[7]\\nMarriott/Lucas became bankrupt, but because he had paid her nothing, Price\\'s copyrights did not go to his creditors. They remained her property, and Not So Quiet... was republished by Newnes, in a format that presented it as more obviously fictional. Four sequels to Not So Quiet were also published by Newnes. These were: Women of the Aftermath (1931); Shadow Women (1932); Luxury Ladies (1933); and They Lived With Me (1934). These books are written in the same dramatic style as Not So Quiet..., and take the same heroine into the challenges of the 1920s. They touch on such social issues as the care of the war-wounded; post-war decadence; eugenics; and the fate of destitute women in London.\\nUnder her own name, Evadne Price was a successful writer of thrillers and romance novels. Thrillers such as Red for Danger and The Phantom Light were filmed. She wrote over 150 paperback novelettes for cheaply produced series such as The Lucky Star Library, The Glamour Library and The Silver Star Library, as well as longer romance novels that were published in hardback. She was a vice-president of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association.[9]\\nPrice\\'s career as a romance novelist took her into playwriting, radio scriptwriting and screenwriting. Her play Big Ben, written for the Malvern Festival in 1939, was a successful one (The Times called it \"a large, comfortable play with a soul to call its own\"). The Phantom Light (1937) was a stage version of her novel, The Haunted Light. The play was also made into a film starring Gordon Harker. Once a Crook (1939) - a play which was co-written by Price and her husband Ken Attiwill, was filmed in 1941. She also acted in the movie Trouble with Junia (1967) in the minor part of Miss Hallyday, beside her husband Ken Attiwill.\\nIn 1965, she and Ken Attiwill joined the scriptwriting team of the ATV soap opera Crossroads[10]\\nEvadne Price had a parallel career as a broadcaster during the early years of British television. Her afternoon horoscope show called \"Fun with the Stars\" led to regular appearances on the lunchtime chat and music show Lunchbox, with Noele Gordon. Price was dubbed the \"new astrologer extraordinaire\" for twenty-five years for the SHE magazine and published a successful collection of these columns as SHE Stargazes. When she and her husband retired to their native Australia in 1976, Evadne Price wrote the monthly horoscope column for Australian Vogue.\\nShe also appeared weekly on the ITV Central evening news magazine show with a 5-minute astrological reading, and she would always close with the catchphrase \"think lucky and you\\'ll be lucky\".\\nEvadne Price died on 17 April 1985 in Sydney, Australia, aged 96. Evadne Price has an unfinished autobiography which was to have been named Mother Painted Nude.\\nIn the year of Price\\'s death, a selection of the Jane Turpin stories was published as Jane and Co, with an introduction by Mary Cadogan (London: Macmillan, 1985).\\nIn 1989, Not So Quiet... was republished to acclaim by The Feminist Press, New York, and later by Virago in the UK.\\nThe Feminist Press edition included a discursive afterword by Jane Marcus, which explained much of the story of the book\\'s origins, but the back cover describes it as \\'a scathing firsthand account of war from the point of view of women actively engaged in it\\', which may have allowed some readers to overestimate its authenticity.\\nSince then there have been notable critical accounts of the novel by Angela K. Smith in The Second Battlefield: Women, Modernism and the First World War,[11] and by Alison Hennegan in \\'Fighting the peace: Two women\\'s accounts of the post-war years\\', an essay included in  The Silent Morning: Culture and Memory After the Armistice, a collection edited by Trudi Tate and Kate Kennedy.[12]\\nStepdaughters of War series\\nWho\\'s Who in the Theatre, 11th Edition, 1952 p.\\xa01175\\nAfterword by Jane Marcus, Not So Quiet...Stepdaughters of War, Evadne Price, The Feminist Press, 1989.\\nAdrienne Thomas: DIE KATRIN WIRD SOLDAT und Anderes aus Lothringen, Röhrig Universitätsverlag, St. Ingbert 2008, 510 S., 37 Abb., ISBN\\xa0978-3-86110-455-1\\n',\n",

Krentz is the author of a string of New York Times bestsellers under seven different pseudonyms. Now, she only uses three names. Under her married name she writes contemporary romantic-suspense. She uses Amanda Quick for her novels of historical romantic-suspense. She uses her maiden name for futuristic/paranormal romantic-suspense writing.\\nOver 35 million copies of Krentz\\'s novels are in print. With Sweet Starfire, she created the futuristic romance subgenre, and further expanded the boundaries of the genre in 1996 with Amaryllis, the first paranormal futuristic romantic suspense novel. She is an outspoken advocate for the romance genre and has been the recipient of the Susan Koppelman Award for Feminist Studies.\\nJayne Ann Castle was born on March 28, 1948, in Cobb, California, United States.[1] She and her two brothers were raised by their mother, Alberta, in Borrego Springs for the first decade of Jayne\\'s life.\\nShe earned a B.A in History at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1970.[2] Fearful that she would be unable to find a job using her degree, she elected to obtain her graduate degree in Library Science from San Jose State University. Immediately after graduation she married Frank Krentz, an engineer, whom she had met at San Jose State. The couple moved to the Virgin Islands, where Krentz worked for a year as an elementary school librarian, a time she refers to as \"an unmitigated career disaster\".[1] Realizing that she enjoyed being a librarian but not the aspects of teaching that working in an elementary school required, Krentz moved into the higher levels of academia, including a stint in the Duke University library system.[1] Krentz and her husband later moved to Seattle, Washington.\\nKrentz has been generous in sharing her wealth with libraries. She established the Castle Humanities Fund at UCSC\\'s University Library to allow the library to purchase additional books and has given money to 15 Seattle-area elementary schools to enhance their library budgets. She is also a member of the Advisory Board for the Writers Programs at the University of Washington extension program.[2][3]\\nWhile working at Duke, Krentz began writing stories her way, combining elements of romance novels with paranormal twists. For six years she wrote and mailed proposals for new novels, consistently receiving rejection letters.[1] She claims to have tried to stop writing several times during that period, but that it became a \"compulsion\".[3] During this time she and her family moved to Seattle, Washington to further her husband\\'s aerospace career.\\nKrentz continued writing, and, in 1979, she sold her first novel, Gentle Pirate.[1] That novel and several that followed were published within various category romance lines, as that was the only method in which contemporary romance was published. As more publishers began to release single-title contemporary romances, Krentz shifted into writing only single-title novels.[4]\\nHer first novels were released under her birth name, Jayne Castle. Krentz signed a contract allowing one of her publishers to own the name, and, after leaving that publisher, Krentz was unable to use that name on new works for ten years. This led to the creation of several pseudonyms, including Jayne Taylor, Jayne Bentley, Stephanie James and Amanda Glass. By the mid-1980s she had begun using only her married name, Jayne Ann Krentz, for all of her contemporary romance novels.[1]\\nHer 1986 novel, Sweet Starfire, was a futuristic romance, a subgenre that combined elements of romance novels and science fiction. The novel was a \"classic road trip romance\" which just happened to be set in a separate galaxy. In 1987 she published a second futuristic romance, Crystal Flame, which again allowed for a \"traditional romance plot unfold[ing] in an extraordinary world\".[5]\\nThe success of these books encouraged Krentz to try to write a real historical romance with a humorous twist, which she released under the pseudonym Amanda Quick.[5]\\nShe began writing paranormal futuristic novels of romantic suspense in 1996. Released under her maiden name, Jayne Castle, these novels are set far in the future in a world where everyone has a psychic talent and respectable people use marriage agencies instead of choosing their own mates. As is customary in her writing, in each case the protagonists have a mystery to solve or a villain to defeat.[6]\\nPsychic themes appear throughout Krentz\\'s work. In 2006 she began a new series, called The Arcane Society, which includes books written as Amanda Quick (historical setting), Jayne Ann Krentz (contemporary setting), and Jayne Castle (futuristic setting). The books tell the stories of members of the Arcane Society for the psychically gifted, and each hero and heroine has his or her own psychic power. The books feature a mystery for the protagonists to solve while they are learning to deal with their psychic abilities.[7] The heroes of her novels are always alpha males who are as strong and determined as her heroines.[8]\\nMore than 120 of Krentz\\'s romance novels have been published, with 32 placing on the New York Times Bestseller List.

Romance is among the most enduring because it addresses the values of family and human emotional bonds.\" To help educate the public about the genre she became the editor of and a contributor to Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women: Romance Writers on the Appeal of the Romance, a non-fiction essay collection that won the prestigious Susan Koppelman Award for Feminist Studies.[3] Krentz was the inspiration for, and first recipient of, the Romantic Times Jane Austen Award, created to \"honor those in the romance community who have significantly impacted our genre\".[10]\\n',\n",

At age 12, her father disagreed with her choices of reading material, which included the Sweet Dreams and the Sweet Valley High book series, and he told her she could only continue reading them if she could prove that they contributed to the development of her reading skills.   She promptly told him that she was studying the literary series, in order, because she was interested in writing a novel in the future.  Challenged to prove that she was, indeed, interested in pursuing a writing career, Quinn sat down at their computer and wrote her first two chapters. After finishing her novel, three years later, she submitted it to Sweet Dreams, but it was rejected.[11]\\nQuinn graduated from Hotchkiss School and Harvard with a degree in Art History. During her senior year of college, she realized that she did not know what she wanted to do with her degree and decided to attend medical school. That decision required her to attend two additional years of college to complete the science prerequisites necessary to apply for medical school.[2] She postponed medical school for two years while she wrote two more novels.[11]\\nTo occupy herself during the long days of studying science, Quinn began to write light-hearted Regency novels.[1]  A few weeks after she was accepted to medical school, she discovered that her first two novels, Splendid and Dancing At Midnight, had been sold at auction, an unusual occurrence for a novice romance author.[12] By the time Quinn finally entered Yale School of Medicine, intending to become a doctor, three of her books had been published. After a few months of studying medicine, Quinn realized that she preferred writing to medical study. She left medical school and devoted herself, full-time, to her writing.[11]\\nQuinn considers herself a feminist and gives her heroines feminist qualities that are not necessarily true to the most prevalent attitudes of the times her novels are set in.[1] Her books are noted for their humor and sharp, witty dialogue.[11] The novels are primarily character-driven, lacking the great external conflicts that many romance novels employ. One of her novels, When He Was Wicked, was unusual for a romance novel, as the first four chapters describe the heroine in a happy marriage with someone who is not the hero, and then shows the death of the original husband and deals with the grief of both the heroine and hero, before allowing the second love story to flourish.[12]\\nMost of her books are dedicated to her husband, Paul Pottinger, often with references to amusing alternate titles for the work. Quinn won the Romance Writers of America RITA Award, in 2007, for On the Way to the Wedding and again, in 2008, for The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever. When she won, in 2010, for What Happens in London, she became (at the time) the youngest member and is now one of only 16 authors to be inducted into the RWA Hall of Fame.\\nIn 2003, she enjoyed the rare honor of being profiled in Time Magazine, an accomplishment few romance novelists have achieved. In 2005, Publishers Weekly gave To Sir Phillip, With Love a rare starred review, and later, the novel was named as one of the six best mass market original novels of the year.[2]\\nEach of her last 17 novels have appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List, with Mr. Cavendish, I Presume hitting number one in October 2008. Most recently, The Girl With the Make-Believe Husband was on the NYT list in June 2017.  In addition to those, both her Lady Whistledown anthologies appeared on the NY Times list, as did both of her novel-in-three-part collaborations with Connie Brockway and Eloisa James (The Lady Most Likely and The Lady Most Willing), and the Bridgertons: Happily Ever After collection of Bridgerton’s second epilogues.\\nHer Bridgerton series of books has been adapted for Netflix by Shonda Rhimes, under the title Bridgerton.[13][14]\\nIn 2001, Quinn won $79,000 on The Weakest Link.[15] She is an avid reader and posts recommendations of her favorite books on her Facebook page. \\nQuinn resides in Seattle, Washington,[16][17] with her husband and two children.[18][19][20]\\nOn June 29, 2021, Quinn\\'s sister and father, Ariana Elise Cotler and Stephen Lewis Cotler, respectively, were killed by a drunk driver in Kaysville, Utah.[21]\\nAll books from Splendid through First Comes Scandal are mass market paperbacks  \\npublished by Avon Books; the last seven titles, also by Avon, are e-books.\\nAccording to Quinn, this two-book set was based on the premise, \"Two men say they’re the Duke of something.

       " '\\nAnn Radcliffe (née Ward; 9 July 1764 – 7 February 1823) was an English novelist and a pioneer of Gothic fiction. Her technique of explaining apparently supernatural elements in her novels has been credited with gaining respectability for Gothic fiction in the 1790s.[1] Radcliffe was the most popular writer of her day and almost universally admired; contemporary critics called her the mighty enchantress and the Shakespeare of romance-writers, and her popularity continued through the 19th century.[2] Interest has revived in the early 21st century, with the publication of three biographies.[3]\\nRadcliffe was born Ann Ward in Holborn, London on 9 July 1764.[4] She was the only child to William Ward (1737–1798) and Ann Oates (1726–1800), and her mother was 36 years old when she gave birth.[5] Her father worked as a haberdasher in London before moving the family to Bath in 1772 to take over management of a porcelain shop for his business partners Thomas Bentley and Josiah Wedgwood. Both of her parents were relatively well connected. Her father had a famous uncle, William Cheselden, who was Surgeon to King George II, and her mother descended from the De Witt family of Holland and had a cousin, Sir Richard Jebb, who was a fashionable London physician.[5]\\nGrowing up, Radcliffe often visited her maternal uncle, Thomas Bentley, in Chelsea, London and later Turnham Green.[5] Bentley was business partners with a fellow Unitarian, Josiah Wedgwood, maker of the Wedgwood China. Sukey, Wedgwood\\'s daughter, also stayed in Chelsea and is Radcliffe\\'s only known childhood companion. Sukey later married Dr. Robert Darwin and had a son, the naturalist Charles Darwin. Although mixing in some distinguished circles, Radcliffe seems to have made little impression in this society and was described by Wedgwood as \"Bentley\\'s shy niece\".[6]\\nIn 1787, when Ann was 23 years old, she married William Radcliffe (1763–1830), who was an Oxford-educated journalist. William had initially been a student of law, but he didn\\'t complete his legal studies and instead turned his attention to literature and journalism.[7] Ann and William were married in Bath but soon after moved to London where William got a job working for a paper.[5] William wrote for (and would soon become the editor of) the Gazetteer and New Daily Advertiser, which was a campaigning newspaper that \"celebrated the French Revolution, freedom of the press, and Dissenter’s rights.\"[8]\\nAnn and William never had children.[5] By all accounts, theirs was a happy marriage. Radcliffe called him her \"nearest relative and friend\".[3] According to Talfourd\\'s memoir, Ann started writing while her husband remained out late most evenings for work.[9] She published her first novel, The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne, in 1789 at the age of 25, and she would go on to publish her next four novels in short succession. The money she earned from her novels later allowed her husband to quit his job, and the two of them travelled together, along with their dog, Chance. In 1794, they went to the Netherlands and Germany. This was her only trip abroad, and it became the inspiration for a travelog that she published a year later. On this trip, Ann and William were actually meant to go on to Switzerland, but this plan was “frustrated by a disobliging official, who refused to believe that they were English, and would not honor their passports.\"[7] In 1795, William returned as editor of the Gazetteer, and a year later, he purchased the English Chronicle or Universal Evening Post, which was a Whig newspaper. Ann published The Italian in 1797, and it would be the last novel published in her lifetime. She was paid £800 for it, which was three times her husband\\'s yearly income.[8]\\nIn her final years, Radcliffe retreated from public life and was rumoured to have gone insane as a result of her writing.[10] These rumours arose because Radcliffe seemingly abandoned writing after publishing her fifth novel and vanished from the public eye. While these rumours were later proven false, they were so popular that Talfourd\\'s memoir actually included a statement from her physician that spoke about her mental condition in her later years.[7] Radcliffe remained secluded for 26 years, with no real explanation available to her many fans.[11] However, this supposed seclusion is contradicted in The New Monthly Magazine, which states that the tenor of Mrs Radcliffe\\'s life was characterized by the rare union of the literary gentlewoman and the active housewife. Instead of being in confinement in Derbyshire, as had been asserted, she was seen, every Sunday, at St James\\'s Church; almost every fine day in Hyde Park; sometimes at the theatres, and very frequently at the Opera.[12]\\nRadcliffe spent the rest of her adult life travelling and living a comfortable life with her husband and their dog, Chance. They travelled domestically almost once a year from 1797 to 1811, and in later years, when they had stopped doing distant excursions, Ann and William would hire a carriage during the summer months so that they could make trips to places near London. Radcliffe did continue to write.[7] She wrote poetry and another novel, Gaston de Blondeville, but this novel was not published until after her lifetime. She was said to have suffered from asthma for which she received regular treatment.\\nIn 1823, Radcliffe went to Ramsgate, but it was here that she caught a chest infection which caused her death. She died 7 February 1823 at the age of 58 and was buried in a vault in the Chapel of Ease at St George\\'s, Hanover Square, London.[13] Although she had suffered from asthma for twelve years previously,[3] her modern biographer, Rictor Norton, cites the description given by her physician, Dr. Scudamore, of how \"a new inflammation seized the membranes of the brain,\" which led to \"violent symptoms\" and argues that they suggest a \"bronchial infection, leading to pneumonia, high fever, delirium and death.\"[14]\\nShortly after her death, Gaston de Blondeville was published by Henry Colburn, featuring A Memoir for the Authoress, the first known biographical piece on Radcliffe.[15] It also contained some of her poetry and her essay \"On the Supernatural in Poetry,\" which outlines her distinction between terror and horror.\\nChristina Rossetti attempted to write a biography of Radcliffe in 1883, but abandoned it for lack of information. For 50 years, biographers stayed away from her as a subject, agreeing with Rossetti\\'s estimation. Rictor Norton, author of Mistress of Udolpho: The Life of Ann Radcliffe (1999), argues that those 50 years were \"dominated by interpretation rather than scholarship\" where information (specifically on her rumoured madness) was repeated rather than traced to a reliable source.[16]\\nRadcliffe published five novels during her lifetime, which she always referred to as \"romances\". Her first novel, The Castles of Athlin and Dubnayne, was published anonymously in 1789. Early reviewers were mostly unenthusiastic about it.[5] The Monthly Review said that, while the novel was commendable for its morality, it appealed only to women and children: \"To men who have passed, or even attained, the meridian of life, a series of events, which seem not to have their foundation in nature, will ever be insipid, if not disgustful”. It was also largely criticized for its anachronisms and inauthentic renderings of the Highlands.[17]\\nOne year later, Radcliffe published her second novel, A Sicilian Romance, which also received little attention. In 1791, she published her third novel, The Romance of the Forest. Like her first two novels, this book was initially published anonymously. On the original title page, it stated that the novel was “By the Authoress of A Sicilian Romance”.[5] The Romance of the Forest was popular with readers, and in the second edition, Radcliffe began adding her own name to the title page.\\nIn 1794, three years later, Radcliffe published The Mysteries of Udolpho. At a time when the average amount earned by an author for a manuscript was £10, her publishers, G. G. and J. Robinson, bought the copyright for this novel for £500,[1] and it was a runaway success. The money from this novel allowed her and her husband to travel to the Netherlands and Germany, which she described in her travelogue A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794 (1795).[18] She published The Italian in 1797, and it was the last novel published in her lifetime. Cadell and Davies paid £800 making Radcliffe the highest-paid professional writer of the 1790s.[1] This novel was written in response to Matthew Gregory Lewis\\'s The Monk because Radcliffe did not like the direction in which Gothic literature was heading. One critic, Nick Groom, writes that, in The Italian, Radcliffe \"takes the violence and eroticism that so titillated readers of The Monk and subsumes them beneath the veil and the cowl of oppressive Catholicism.\"[8]\\nA final novel, Gaston de Blondeville was published posthumously in 1826. This novel was published with Talfourd\\'s memoir and Radcliffe\\'s unfinished essay \"On the Supernatural in Poetry\", which details the difference between the sensation of terror her works aimed to achieve and the horror Lewis sought to evoke.[19] Radcliffe stated that terror aims to stimulate readers through imagination and perceived evils while horror closes them off through fear and physical dangers:[20] \"Terror and Horror are so far opposite, that the first expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life; the other contracts, freezes and nearly annihilates them.\"[21]\\nRadcliffe portrayed her female characters as equal to male characters, allowing them to dominate and overtake the typically powerful male villains and heroes, creating new roles for women in literature previously not available.[22] Radcliffe was also known for including supernatural elements but eventually giving readers a rational explanation for the supernatural. Usually, Radcliffe would reveal the logical excuse for what first appeared to be supernatural towards the end of her novels, which led to heightened suspense. Some critics/readers found this disappointing and felt duped. Perhaps the most eloquent complaint against the trope was penned by Walter Scott in his Lives of the Novelists (1821–1824). Regarding Radcliffe\\'s penchant for explaining the supernatural, he writes: “A stealthy step behind the arras may, doubtless, in some situations, and when the nerves are tuned to a certain pitch, have no small influence upon the imagination; but if the conscious listener discovers it to be only the noise made by the cat, the solemnity of the feeling is gone, and the visionary is at once angry with his sense for having been cheated, and with his reason for having acquiesced in the deception.\"[23] Some modern critics have been frustrated by her work, as she fails to include \"real ghosts\". This could be motivated by the idea that works in the Romantic period, from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, had to undermine Enlightenment values such as rationalism and realism.[23]\\nRadcliffe\\'s work have been considered by some scholars to be part of a larger tradition of anti-Catholicism within Gothic literature; her works contain hostile portrayals of both Catholicism and Catholics.[24] The Italian frequently presents Catholicism, the largest religion in Italy, in a negative light. In the novel, Radcliffe portrays Catholic elements such as the Inquisition in a negative light, pointing to its discriminatory practises against non-Catholics. Radcliffe also portrays the confessional as a \"danger zone\" controlled by the power of the priest and the church.[25] The Mysteries of Udolpho also contained negative portrayals of Catholicism; both novels are set in Catholic-majority Italy, and Catholicism was presented as being part of \"ancient Italianess\". Italy, along with its Catholicism, had been featured in earlier Gothic literature; Horace Walpole\\'s novel The Castle of Otranto claimed in-universe that it was \"found in the library of an ancient catholic family in the north of England\" and \"printed at Naples, in the black letter, in the year 1529\".[26]\\nSome scholars have suggested that Radcliffe\\'s anti-Catholicism was partly a response to the 1791 Roman Catholic Relief Act passed by the British parliament, which was a major component of Catholic emancipation in Great Britain.[24] Other scholars have suggested that Radcliffe was ultimately ambivalent towards Catholicism, claiming that she was a Latitudinarian.[27]\\nRadcliffe used the framing narrative of personifying nature in many of her novels. For example, she believed that the sublime motivated the protagonist to create an image that was more idealistic within the plot.[28] Her elaborate descriptions of landscape were influenced by the painters Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin, and Salvator Rosa.[6] She often wrote about places she had never visited. Lorrain\\'s influence can be seen through Radcliffe\\'s picturesque, romantic descriptions, for example in the first volume of The Mysteries of Udolpho. Rosa\\'s influence can be seen through dark landscapes and elements of the Gothic.\\n\\nRadcliffe once said of Claude:[3]In a shaded corner, near the chimney, a most exquisite Claude, an evening view, perhaps over the Campagna of Rome. The sight of this picture imparted much of the luxurious repose and satisfaction, which we derive from contemplating the finest scenes of nature. Here was the poet, as well as the painter, touching the imagination, and making you see more than the picture contained. You saw the real light of the sun, you breathed the air of the country, you felt all the circumstances of a luxurious climate on the most serene and beautiful landscape; and the mind thus softened, you almost fancied you hear Italian music in the air.\"I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe’s works, and most of them with great pleasure. The Mysteries of Udolpho, when I had once begun it, I could not lay down again;—I remember finishing it in two days—my hair standing on end the whole time.\"[29]\\n\\xa0— Jane Austen, Northanger Abbey (1817)\\nRadcliffe influenced many later authors, both by inspiring more Gothic fiction and by inspiring parodies. In the eighteenth century, she inspired writers like Matthew Lewis (1775 – 1818) and the Marquis de Sade (1740–1814), who praised her work but produced more intensely violent fiction. Radcliffe is known for having spawned a large number of lesser imitators of the \"Radcliffe School\", such as Harriet Lee and Catherine Cuthbertson. Jane Austen (1775 – 1817) parodied The Mysteries of Udolpho in Northanger Abbey (1817), and she defined her fiction as a contrast to Radcliffe and writers like her. Scholars have also perceived other apparent allusions to Radcliffe\\'s novels and life in Austen\\'s work.[30]\\nIn the early nineteenth century, Radcliffe influenced Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849), and Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832). For example, Scott interspersed his work with poems in a similar manner to Radcliffe, and one assessment of her reads, \"Scott himself said that her prose was poetry and her poetry was prose. She was, indeed, a prose poet, in both the best and the worst senses of the phrase. The romantic landscape, the background, is the best thing in all her books; the characters are two dimensional, the plots far fetched and improbable, with \\'elaboration of means and futility of result\\'.\"[31] Later in the nineteenth century, Charlotte and Emily Brontë continued Radcliffe\\'s Gothic tradition with their novels Jane Eyre, Villette, and Wuthering Heights.\\nRadcliffe was also admired by French authors like Honoré de Balzac (1799 – 1850), Victor Hugo (1802 – 1885), Alexandre Dumas (1802 – 1870), and Charles Baudelaire (1821 – 1867).[32] Honoré de Balzac\\'s novel of the supernatural L\\'Héritière de Birague (1822) follows the tradition of Radcliffe\\'s style and parodies it.[33]\\nAs a child the young Fyodor Dostoyevsky was deeply impressed by Radcliffe. In Winter Notes on Summer Impressions (1863) he writes, \"I used to spend the long winter hours before bed listening (for I could not yet read), agape with ecstasy and terror, as my parents read aloud to me from the novels of Ann Radcliffe. Then I would rave deliriously about them in my sleep.\" A number of scholars have noted elements of Gothic literature in Dostoyevsky\\'s novels,[34] and some have tried to show direct influence of Radcliffe\\'s work.[35]\\nIn 1875, Paul Féval wrote a story starring Radcliffe as a vampire hunter, titled La Ville Vampire: Adventure Incroyable de Madame Anne Radcliffe (\"City of Vampires: The Incredible Adventure of Mrs. Anne Radcliffe\"), which blends fiction and history.[36] At the last minute a mysterious man on a white horse saves the day, none other than Lord Wellington fresh from the Battle of Waterloo.\\nHelen McCrory plays Ann Radcliffe in the 2007 film Becoming Jane, starring Anne Hathaway as Jane Austen. The film depicts Radcliffe as meeting the young Jane Austen and encouraging her to pursue a literary career. No evidence exists that such a meeting ever occurred.\\n',\n",

       " 'Francine Sandra Rivers (born 1947) is an American author of fiction with Christian themes, including inspirational romance novels.  Prior to becoming a born-again Christian in 1986, Rivers wrote historical romance novels. She is best known for her inspirational novel Redeeming Love, while another novel, The Last Sin Eater, received its own film adaptation released in 2007 by Fox Faith. A film based on Redeeming Love was released on January 21, 2022 through Pinnacle Peak Pictures and Universal Pictures.[1][2]\\nFrancine Rivers is the daughter of a police officer and a nurse.  From the time she was a child, Rivers wanted to be a published author. She attended Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton, California.[3] She attended the University of Nevada, Reno, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and journalism. After her graduation she spent time as a newspaper reporter, writing obituaries and human interest stories.[4]\\nAfter her mother-in-law lent her several romance novels, Rivers decided that she would try to write in that genre. Her first manuscript was sold and became published in 1976. For the next several years she wrote historical romance novels.[4]\\nIn 1986, Rivers became a born-again Christian, and for three years she had difficulty finding plots for new novels. She spent her time instead studying the Bible, and decided to adapt her writing to focus on more Christian themes. Her first novel in the new vein, Redeeming Love, was released in 1991. Rivers considers it to be her statement of faith.[4] Redeeming Love updates the Old Testament book of Hosea to the American West of the 1850s and tells the story of a prostitute named Angel, who is eventually reformed and converted to Christianity by the stoic patience and love of a frontier farmer named Michael Hosea.\\nRivers\\' subsequent novels have all been in the inspirational fiction genre, as Rivers wants to \"illustrate Christ and the Christian walk, to address difficult problems and write realistic stories.\"[5]  In a letter on her webpage\\n[6] Francine Rivers refers to the books written before her conversion to Christianity as her \"B.C.\" (before Christ) bibliography.  She has purchased the publication rights to her earlier romance novels so that she can prevent them from being released again, but some titles have been rereleased and others circulate in used bookstores.[4]\\nHer inspirational series, The Mark of the Lion, sold over half a million copies.[5]  In 2007, her novel The Last Sin Eater was made into a feature film, directed by Michael Landon Jr. and distributed by Fox Faith.[7]\\nRivers has been honored with many awards, including the Christy Award, the ECPA Gold Medallion, and the Holt Medallion.[7]  Rivers is also a member of the Romance Writers of America\\'s Hall of Fame.  She has won four RWA RITA Awards, the highest award given in romantic fiction. Her first RITA was for Best Historical Romance in 1986 for Not So Wild a Dream.  Her subsequent ones, in 1995, 1996, and 1997, have been for Best Inspirational Romance.[8]\\nShe executive produced and wrote the script for the upcoming film adaptation of her novel, Redeeming Love, which is set to debut in theaters in 2021.[2]\\nFrancine Rivers is married to Rick Rivers and they live together in northern California (where the action in many of her contemporary novels is set).

       " 'Karen Robards (born August 24, 1954, in Louisville, Kentucky) is a best-selling author of over fifty novels.  After first gaining recognition for her historical romances, Robards became one of the first historical romance novelists to successfully make the switch to contemporary romantic suspense.[1]  Her work has been translated into seventeen languages, and has won multiple awards.\\nKaren Robards sold her first story in 1973.  As a teenager working part-time for her orthodontist father, Robards saw a Reader\\'s Digest solicitation for funny anecdotes.  She quickly penned and submitted a two-paragraph story.  Several weeks later she received a check for $100, and her entry was featured in the December 1973 Reader\\'s Digest.[2]\\nHer first attempts at writing a novel came while she was attending the University of Kentucky taking a graduate-level creative writing class, when the professor challenged each student to write 50 pages that could be published.  After researching what types of books were selling well, Robards chose to write a historical romance, not realizing that she would be required to read her work aloud to the class.  Although her professor and classmates laughed at her choice of subject matter, those 50 pages became the basis for her first book, Island Flame.[3]  This debut novel was published in 1981, when Robards was in her early 20s.[4]\\nAt the time that Robards\\'s debut novel was published, the typical paperback historical romance novel had a shelf life of only three weeks.  After three weeks, her novel was no longer available on bookstore shelves, and her publisher was reluctant to purchase any further work without seeing the sales figures for the current book.  Undeterred, Robards dropped out of law school to pursue her writing career.  To pay her bills, she took a job in an orthodontic clinic, writing a new novel in the ladies\\' room at the clinic while on her lunch break.   She finished this second book, the contemporary romantic suspense To Love a Man, in three months.  The book sold quickly to a different publisher and became the true launchpad for her writing career.[5]\\nWithin the next several years, Robards had three additional historical romances published, including Sea Fire, the sequel to Island Flame, before To Love a Man was officially released.[5]  After the publication of To Love a Man, Robards\\'s new publisher contracted her to write two novels per year, one a historical romance and the other contemporary romantic suspense.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, publishers began to fear that the contemporary romance market was \"dead\", and Robards was asked to write only historicals.  She switched publishers in the early 1990s, moving to Dell, and convinced them to take a chance on a new contemporary romance.  That novel, One Summer, was Robards\\' first hardcover contemporary novel, and its success convinced Dell to ask Robards to concentrate on her contemporary novels.[1]  Her novels have been translated into eleven languages.[6]\\nAccording to Romantic Times Magazine, \"Robards has a true flair for characterization and excels at adding large doses of humor to the spicy mix.\"[4]  She has won a Romantic Times Career Achievement Award, six Affaire de Coeur Silver Pen awards for favorite romance novelist, along with multiple other awards for her novels.[7]\\nRobards lives in her hometown, Louisville, Kentucky, with her husband, Doug Robards, and their three sons, Jack, Chris, and Peter.[8]  Her parents, three brothers, and sister live nearby.[5]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nNora Roberts (born Eleanor Marie Robertson on October 10, 1950) is an American author of over 225 romance novels.[1] She writes as J. D. Robb, Jill March and (in the U.K.) Sarah Hardesty.\\nRoberts was the first author to be inducted into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame. As of 2011, her novels had spent a combined 861 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, including 176 weeks in the number-one spot.\\nRoberts was born on October 10, 1950, in Silver Spring, Maryland, the youngest of five children.[2] Her parents have Irish ancestry, and she has described herself as \"an Irishwoman through and through\".[3] Her family were avid readers, so books were always important in her life.[4] Although she had always made up stories in her head, Roberts did not write as a child, other than essays for school. She does claim to have \"told lies. Really good ones—some of which my mother still believes.\"[5] She credits the nuns at her Catholic school for instilling in her a sense of discipline.[5]\\nDuring her second year in high school, Roberts transferred to Montgomery Blair High School,[6] where she met her first husband, Ronald Aufdem-Brinke.[7] They married, against her parents\\' wishes, in 1968, as soon as she graduated,[8][9] and settled in Boonsboro. \\nRoberts\\' husband worked at his father\\'s sheet-metal business before joining her parents in their lighting company. She gave birth to two sons, Dan and Jason. Roberts would later refer to this time period as her \"Earth Mother\" years, when she did crafts, including ceramics and sewing her children\\'s clothes.[8] The couple divorced[10] in 1983.\\nRoberts met her second husband, Bruce Wilder, a carpenter, when she hired him to build bookshelves in July 1985.[11][12] Her husband owns Turn the Page Books bookstore in Boonsboro, Maryland,[13] and works as an adult content photographer and videographer.[14]   The couple also owned the nearby historic Boone Hotel. After it was destroyed by a fire in February 2008, it was restored and reopened as the Inn BoonsBoro in 2009; the suites were inspired by and named for literary romantic couples with happy endings.[15]\\nShe is an ardent baseball fan, having been honored by the local minor league baseball team Hagerstown Suns several times.[16]\\nShe began to write during a blizzard in February 1979. Roberts states that with three feet of snow, a dwindling supply of chocolate, and no morning kindergarten for her two boys, she had little else to do.[17][18] She fell in love with the writing process, and quickly produced six manuscripts[19] which she submitted to Harlequin, the leading publisher of romance novels, but was repeatedly rejected. Roberts says,\\nI got the standard rejection for the first couple of tries, then my favorite rejection of all time. I received my manuscript back with a nice little note which said that my work showed promise, and the story had been very entertaining and well done. But that they already had their American writer. That would have been Janet Dailey.[20]Dailey would go on to be embroiled in a plagiarism scandal in which she eventually confessed to stealing some of Roberts\\' work.\\nRoberts once stated: \"You\\'re going to be unemployed if you really think you just have to sit around and wait for the muse to land on your shoulder.\"[21] She concentrates on one novel at a time,[22] writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation.[9] Rather than begin with an outline, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting.[21] She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. Roberts then  goes back to the beginning of the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the \"texture and color\" of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower.[23]\\nShe often writes trilogies, finishing the three books in a row so that she can remain with the same characters.[24] In the past, her trilogies were all released in paperback, as Roberts believed the wait for hardcover editions was too long for the reader.[4] All her new publications are released in hardcover first and e-book, with paperback editions following. \\nRoberts does much of her research over the Internet, as she has an aversion to flying.[9]\\nIn 1980, a new publisher, Silhouette Books, formed to take advantage of the manuscripts from the American writers that Harlequin had rejected.[25] Roberts\\' first novel, Irish Thoroughbred, was published in 1981, using the pseudonym Nora Roberts, a shortened form of her birth name Eleanor Marie Robertson because she assumed that all romance authors had pen names.[8]\\nBetween 1982 and 1984, Roberts wrote 23 novels for Silhouette,[8] published under various Silhouette imprints: Silhouette Sensation, Silhouette Special Edition and Silhouette Desire, as well as Silhouette Intrigue, and MIRA\\'s reissue program. In 1985, Playing the Odds, the first novel in the MacGregor family series, was published and was an immediate bestseller.[8]\\nIn 1987, she began writing single title books for Bantam. Five years later she moved to Putnam to write single title hardcovers and original paperbacks,[26] reaching the hardcover bestseller lists with her fourth hardcover release, 1996\\'s Montana Sky. Roberts has continued to release single-title novels in paperback. She still occasionally writes shorter category romances. Her attachment to the shorter category books stems from her years as a young mother of two boys without much time to read, as she \"[remembers] exactly what it felt like to want to read and not have time to read 200,000 words.\"[9]\\nRoberts was featured in Pamela Regis\\' A Natural History of the Romance Novel. Regis calls Roberts \"a master of the romance novel form\", because she \"has a keen ear for dialogue, constructs deft scenes, maintains a page-turning pace, and provides compelling characterization.\"[20] Publishers Weekly once talked about her \"wry humor and the use of different narrators, two devices that were once rarities\" in the romance novel genre.[9]\\nRoberts had long wanted to write romantic suspense in the vein of Mary Stewart, but, at the urging of her agent, she concentrated on classic contemporary romance while she built a following of readers.[9] After moving to Putnam in 1992, the publishing company quickly realized that they were unable to keep up with Roberts\\'s prolific output. They suggested that she adopt a second pseudonym so they would be able to publish more of her work each year.[24]\\nHer agent, Amy Berkover, convinced the publishers to allow Roberts to write romantic suspense under the new name.[9]  She chose the pseudonym D. J. MacGregor, but right before publication, discovered it was in use by another author.[17]  Instead, her first romantic suspense novel was published in 1995 under the pseudonym J. D. Robb. The initials \"J. D.\" were taken from her sons, Jason and Dan, while \"Robb\" is a shortened form of Roberts.\\nAs J. D. Robb, Roberts has published a series of futuristic science fiction police procedurals. These books, all part of the in Death series, feature detective Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke and are set in a mid-21st century New York City. Despite the emphasis on solving a crime in each of the books, the overall theme of the series is the development of the relationship between Eve and Roarke.[24] When the in Death series began, neither Roberts nor her publisher acknowledged that she was the author. They hoped to allow the series to stand on its own merits and build its own following.[27]\\nAfter publishing 18 novels in the in Death series, Putnam published the nineteenth, Divided in Death, first in hardcover. The book became Roberts\\' first bestselling novel of 2004.[28]\\nAs of March 2022, Roberts has published 54 novels plus ten novellas in the in Death series.[29]\\nRoberts wrote a story for a magazine titled Melodies of Love under the pseudonym Jill March.[17] She has also been known as Sarah Hardesty in the UK. When the Born In series was released in Britain it carried that name instead of Nora Roberts. She has since changed publishers.[17]\\nIn 1996, Roberts passed the hundred-novel mark with Montana Sky and, in 2012, doubled that with The Witness. In both 1999 and 2000, four of the five novels that USA Today listed as the best-selling romance novels of the year were written by Roberts. Her first appearance on The New York Times Best Seller list came in 1991,[22] and between 1991 and 2001, she had 68 New York Times Bestsellers, counting hardbacks and paperbacks. [30] In 2001, Roberts had 10 best-selling mass-market paperbacks, according to Publishers Weekly, not counting those books written under the J.D. Robb name. In September 2001, for the first time Roberts took the numbers 1 and 2 spots on the Publishers Weekly bestseller list, as her romance Time and Again was number one, and her J.D. Robb release Seduction in Death was number two.[31]\\nSince 1999, every one of Roberts\\'s novels has been a New York Times bestseller, and 124 of her novels have ranked on the Times bestseller list, including 29 that debuted in the number-one spot. As of January 24, 2013, Roberts\\'s novels had spent a combined 948 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, including 148 weeks in the number-one spot. As of January 9, 2009, 400\\xa0million copies of her books are in print, including 12\\xa0million copies sold in 2005 alone. Her novels have been published in 35 countries.[32]\\nA founding member of the Romance Writers of America (RWA), Roberts was the first inductee in the organization\\'s Hall of Fame.[9] In 1997 she was awarded the RWA Lifetime Achievement Award, which in 2008 was renamed the RWA Nora Roberts Lifetime Achievement Award.[33] As of 2012, she has won an unprecedented 21 of the RWA\\'s RITA Awards, the highest honor given in the romance genre.[34]\\nTwo of Roberts\\' novels, Sanctuary and Magic Moments, had previously been made into TV movies. In 2007, Lifetime Television adapted four Nora Roberts novels into TV movies: Angels Fall starring Heather Locklear, Montana Sky starring Ashley Williams, Blue Smoke starring Alicia Witt, and Carolina Moon starring Claire Forlani. This was the first time that Lifetime had adapted multiple works by the same author.[35] Four more films were released on four consecutive Saturdays in March and April 2009. The 2009 collection included Northern Lights starring LeAnn Rimes and Eddie Cibrian, Midnight Bayou starring Jerry O\\'Connell, High Noon starring Emilie de Ravin, and Tribute starring Brittany Murphy.\\nTIME named Roberts one of their 100 Most Influential People in 2007, saying she \"has inspected, dissected, deconstructed, explored, explained and extolled the passions of the human heart.\"[36] Roberts was one of only two authors on the list, the other being David Mitchell.[36]\\nIn 1997, another best-selling romance writer, Janet Dailey, admitted to repeatedly plagiarizing Roberts\\' work. The practice came to light after a reader read Roberts\\' Sweet Revenge and Dailey\\'s Notorious back-to-back; she noticed several similarities and posted the comparable passages on the Internet. Calling the plagiarism \"mind-boggling\", Roberts sued Dailey.[9] Dailey acknowledged the plagiarism and attributed it to a psychological disorder. She admitted that both Aspen Gold and Notorious lifted heavily from Roberts\\' work. Both of those novels were pulled from print after Dailey\\'s admission.[37][38] In April 1998, Dailey settled the case. Roberts donated the settlement to various literary causes including the Literacy Volunteers of America (now ProLiteracy).[9][39][40][41]\\nRoberts joined the chorus strongly criticizing fellow romance writer Cassie Edwards, who had lifted many passages from much older sources (many in the public domain) without giving credit, forcing Edwards out of the business.[42][43]\\nIn 2019 Roberts, along with other authors, was a victim of plagiarism by Cristiane Serruya.[44][45][46]\\nRoberts has been included repeatedly on the Giving Back Fund\\'s annual lists of the most philanthropic celebrities, with the bulk of her donations going to the Nora Roberts Foundation.[47][48][49] The foundation financially supports organizations that promote literacy and the arts, assist children and engage in humanitarian efforts.

In 2007, Lifetime Television adapted four Nora Roberts novels into TV movies: Angels Fall starring Heather Locklear, Montana Sky starring Ashley Williams, Blue Smoke starring Alicia Witt, and Carolina Moon starring Claire Forlani. This was the first time that Lifetime had adapted multiple works by the same author.[35] Four more films were released on four consecutive Saturdays in March and April 2009. The 2009 collection included Northern Lights starring LeAnn Rimes and Eddie Cibrian, Midnight Bayou starring Jerry O\\'Connell, High Noon starring Emilie de Ravin, and Tribute starring Brittany Murphy.\\nTIME named Roberts one of their 100 Most Influential People in 2007, saying she \"has inspected, dissected, deconstructed, explored, explained and extolled the passions of the human heart.\"[36] Roberts was one of only two authors on the list, the other being David Mitchell.[36]\\nIn 1997, another best-selling romance writer, Janet Dailey, admitted to repeatedly plagiarizing Roberts\\' work. The practice came to light after a reader read Roberts\\' Sweet Revenge and Dailey\\'s Notorious back-to-back; she noticed several similarities and posted the comparable passages on the Internet. Calling the plagiarism \"mind-boggling\", Roberts sued Dailey.[9] Dailey acknowledged the plagiarism and attributed it to a psychological disorder. She admitted that both Aspen Gold and Notorious lifted heavily from Roberts\\' work. Both of those novels were pulled from print after Dailey\\'s admission.[37][38] In April 1998, Dailey settled the case. Roberts donated the settlement to various literary causes including the Literacy Volunteers of America (now ProLiteracy).[9][39][40][41]\\nRoberts joined the chorus strongly criticizing fellow romance writer Cassie Edwards, who had lifted many passages from much older sources (many in the public domain) without giving credit, forcing Edwards out of the business.[42][43]\\nIn 2019 Roberts, along with other authors, was a victim of plagiarism by Cristiane Serruya.[44][45][46]\\nRoberts has been included repeatedly on the Giving Back Fund\\'s annual lists of the most philanthropic celebrities, with the bulk of her donations going to the Nora Roberts Foundation.[47][48][49] The foundation financially supports organizations that promote literacy and the arts, assist children and engage in humanitarian efforts.

She wrote under her first married name and under the pen-names: Denise Chesterton, Eve Vaill, \\'Anne Llewellyn\\', Hervey Hamilton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray and Julia Kane, producing short stories, plays, and about 170 Gothic romance novels. In 1965, Robins published her autobiography, Stranger Than Fiction. At the time of her death in 1985, Robins\\'s books had been translated into fifteen languages and had sold more than one hundred million copies. In 1984, they were borrowed more than one and a half million times from British libraries.[2]\\nShe was the daughter of the novelist K. C. Groom, and mother of romance novelist Patricia Robins. Some other members of her family are well-known artists.\\nRobins was born Denise Naomi Klein on 1 February 1897 in London, England, the daughter of Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell, who was also a prolific author who wrote under several names, and of her first husband, Herman Klein, who was a professor of music and journalist. Of Russian Jewish ancestry, he had been born in Norwich in 1856. Her mother Kathleen Clarice had been born in Melbourne, Australia, on 11 March 1872 and was the daughter of George Cornwell and his wife Jemima Ridpath, married in 1850.[3] George Cornwell was a railway guard who became a successful gold prospector in Australia, operating several mines, and a notable building contractor. His eldest daughter, Alice Cornwell, born 1852, was spectacularly rich by the 1890s, returning to England and buying the Sunday Times newspaper.[4][5]\\nHer parents had married in 1890. He had a daughter Sibyl Klein, from a previous marriage, and they had two sons: Adrian Bernard Klein (1892–1969) and Daryl Klein (1894), before the birth of Denise Naomi Klein (1897–1985). The childhood of Denise, Adrian and Daryl Klein was far from settled. Kathleen Klein began an affair with a Worcestershire Regiment officer called Herbert Berkeley Dealtry, who was much younger than her husband, and little than herself, and when Hermann Klein became aware of it he filed a petition for divorce, which was granted in December 1901. Kathleen then married Dealtry.[4]\\nIn 1905, the Dealtrys had some serious troubles in connection with the promotion of dog shows, which they had been drawn into by Kathleen\\'s sister Alice Stennard Robinson, a leading member of the Ladies\\' Kennel Association (founded 1904) and the National Cat Club. Somehow, the money from the first dog show went missing, and the Dealtrys held a second show to pay the prize money owed on the first. After the second show, prize winners sued Dealtry, which led to his being declared bankrupt.[4] The family then lived in America for a few years but, by 1908, Kathleen (or \\'Kit\\') Dealtry was back in London, writing Christian novels.[6] In 1918 she married for a third time and wrote at least three books[7] as Mrs Sydney Groom.[4]\\nHer eldest brother Adrian Bernard Klein also became a writer, he was an artist and wrote books on photography and cinematography. After serving as an officer in the British Army, he became a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and changed his name to Adrian Cornwell-Clyne.[4]\\nDenise Naomi Klein married firstly Arthur Robins in 1918, a corn broker on the Baltic Exchange,[8] they had three daughters, Eve Louise, Patricia Robins (a.k.a. Claire Lorrimer) who became another best-selling author, and Anne Eleanor.[8] In 1938, the marriage ended in divorce, after Robins met O\\'Neill Pearson in Egypt,[9] they married in 1939. However, like Agatha Christie, Robins continued to publish most of her books under her first married name.[1]\\nWhen she left school, Denise Klein went to work as a journalist for the D. C. Thomson Press, then became a freelance writer. She began to follow in her mother\\'s footsteps when her first novel was published in 1924. Her serial What is Love? ran in The Star from December 1925 to February 1926.[10] Her first play, Heatwave, written in collaboration with Roland Pertwee, was produced at the St James\\'s Theatre, London, in 1929.[11] As a writer of fiction, Denise Klein wrote under a variety of pen-names, including Denise Chesterton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray, Hervey Hamilton and Julia Kane.[1] After marrying Arthur Robins, many of her books were written under her married name.[11]\\nRobins had been writing fiction and getting it published for ten years when in 1927 she met Charles Boon, of Mills & Boon, and she entered her first contract with his firm the same year. Under the terms of this, she was to be paid an advance of thirty pounds for three novels, plus ten per cent terms. Her next contract, for a further six books, delivered an advance of twenty-five pounds for each book, while her third contract, for four more books, paid one hundred pounds for each, plus terms of twelve and a half per cent.[12]\\nThe colourful dust wrappers of Mills & Boon\\'s books were becoming one of their biggest selling points. As an example, the cover of Robins\\'s Women Who Seek (1928) showed a glamorous flapper checking her make-up.[13]\\n\\nRobins became not only Mills & Boon\\'s most prolific writer, but also their best paid. A contract she signed in 1932 paid her £2,400 for eight books, which were those from Shatter the Sky (July 1933) to How Great the Price (June 1935). This was, however, her last work for the firm, as she was then \\'poached\\' by a new publisher, Nicholson & Watson.[14] Of this development, Arthur Boon wrote:[14] Denise Robins, one of our greatest authors, knew she could sell on her name more than other authors could. She was a superstar, and she knew it. Our problem was to find a way to satisfy the superstar. What could Mills & Boon offer a superstar? Superstars weren\\'t grateful.\\nRobins gave her version of events in her autobiography:[11][14] Suddenly a young man named Ivor Nicholson came along – a clever, charming journalist who, with the wealth of Bernard Watson to back his new venture, launched a new publishing house – Ivor Nicholson & Watson. They wanted my name on their list. They tempted me with what was the biggest offer I had ever received from any literary quarter, a cheque for one thousand pounds, free, gratis, and for which I need do no work. It was merely for signing the contract! I did not go behind Charles Boon\\'s back. I told him the facts. Unfortunately he was so annoyed by Ivor Nicholson\\'s offer that he refused to compete and at once released me from my contract with his firm. Somewhat reluctantly I left my old publishers and became the new Nicholson & Watson \\'star\\' author.The first book Robins wrote for Nicholson was Life and Love (1935), which was launched with a huge publicity campaign. Robins\\'s first photo opportunity was a visit to Liverpool to open a new lending library, and the slogan \\'Robins for Romance\\' was posted on London buses.[14]\\nJoseph McAleer has described Robins as \"the recognised mistress of the punishing kiss device.[15]\\nDuring her long career as a writer, from about 1917 until her death in 1985, Robins certainly wrote more than one hundred and sixty books. She was dubbed by the Daily Graphic \"the queen of romantic fiction\".[4]\\nShe was elected as President of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association in 1961.[9]\\nIn 1965, Robins published her autobiography, Stranger Than Fiction, summarised thus: \"Apart from writing nearly two hundred novels that have brought her millions of fans throughout the world, Denise Robins led a remarkable life. Her unhappy childhood did not sour her belief in love. Here is her own story.\"[16][17]\\nAt the time of her death in 1985, Robins\\'s books had been translated into fifteen languages and had sold more than one hundred million copies. In 1984, they were borrowed more than one and a half million times from British libraries. Among her best-selling works were House of the Seventh Cross, Khamsin and Dark Corridor.[2] In October 2011 the first dozen of her novels were released in e-book format.[18]\\nSome of her novels have been reedited under different titles or as Denise Robins[17]\\n',\n",

She was the second romance author, after Kathleen Woodiwiss, to have her novels published in trade paperback format.[1] Both writers found their initial success working with editor Nancy Coffey who was then with Avon Books.

She began writing at age eight, and throughout her teens penned many romantic epics in the style of her favorite writers, Sir Walter Scott, Alexandre Dumas, père, and Rafael Sabatini.[7][8]  She was the first woman in her family to work outside the home as a feature writer for a Ceylon newspaper.[6]\\nAfter spending three years at the University of Ceylon, Rogers became a reporter, and soon married Summa Navaratnam, a Ceylonese rugby player and track star (who played for Ceylon against the 1950 British Lions and who was known as \"the fastest man in Asia\").[9][10] Following a separation from her husband, Rogers moved with their two daughters, Rosanne and Sharon, to London in 1960.[7][8]\\nIn Europe, she met Leroy Rogers from the United States.

Rosenthal has reviewed literary biography and fiction for Salon and other newspapers and magazines.[3]  In 2010 Rosenthal participated in an academic conference held in Brussels by the International Association for the Study of Popular Romance.[4] Diverging from much of the current academic and scholarly production on romance, her critical work does not primarily focus on vindicating the genre and its values (a project furthered in recent years by, among others, Crusie, Jayne Ann Krentz,[5][6] Mary Bly,[7] Sarah MacLean and Jen Prokop,[8] Pamela Regis,[9] Maya Rodale,[10] Candy Tan and Sarah Wendell,[11] and others), but rather pursues a formal inquiry, based in both her own experience with genre conventions and the hermeneutic practices of queer theory adapted to the cultural studies tradition usually traced to Raymond Williams.\\nWhile satisfying the requirements of the romance genre, Rosenthal\\'s work also exhibits some features typical of literary novels but infrequently found in genre romance, including the development of symbolic themes.  Her approximately \"Regency-set\" historical romances are unusual in the genre for their relatively unvarnished depiction of the period\\'s inequalities, violence and physical hardships. The genre generally requires softening the depiction of the life of servants and the working class, but Rosenthal\\'s work demonstrates an awareness of the elitism of the genre\\'s formulae, and develops the labouring class figures in her world into compelling secondary characters.[citation needed]\\nAs Molly Weatherfield:\\nAs Pam Rosenthal:\\n',\n",

       " 'Ann Bishop Roth (born October 30, 1931) is an American costume designer. She has designed the costumes of various prominent films, and has been nominated five times for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design, winning twice for The English Patient (1996) and Ma Rainey\\'s Black Bottom (2020). In the 2023 movie Barbie, Roth, at 91 years old, appears onscreen to share a pivotal[2] scene with Barbie (played by Margot Robbie).\\nRoth was born in Hanover, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Eleanor and James Roth.[1] Roth is a Carnegie Mellon graduate who began her career as a scenery painter for the Pittsburgh Opera. She intended to remain in the field of production design until she met Irene Sharaff at the Bucks County Playhouse. Sharaff invited her to California to assist her with costumes on the film Brigadoon and suggested Roth apprentice with her for five films and five Broadway productions before setting out on her own.[3]\\nRoth\\'s first Hollywood film was 1964\\'s The World of Henry Orient, where her designs included \"monogrammed handmade yellow silk pajamas\" for glamorous womanizer Peter Sellers.[2]\\nAccording to Glenn Frankel, Roth \"designed not just costumes but characters\" for the 1969 film Midnight Cowboy.[4][5] Roth found elegant but grimy white pants for Dustin Hoffman\\'s character Ratso Rizzo on street-sale tables in New York City. Because Jon Voight\\'s fringed suede jacket had to \"look real and unhip,\" Roth made it herself. For Brenda Vaccaro\\'s socialite character to wear in a sex scene, Roth paid $200 for a fox-fur jacket owned by one of her neighbors.[6]\\nRoth as costume designer created a \"show-stopping\" nightgown for Barbra Streisand to wear in her first non-musical film The Owl and the Pussycat (1970). The short black nightgown featured appliqué pink hands cupping the breasts[7] and (to quote Roth\\'s own description, \"a heart on her pee-pee.\"[2] Interviewed in 2013 about the origins of the costume idea, Roth said that her research included \"looking for dirty, erotic, skuzzy underwear\" in the pornographic magazine Screw, after which \"somehow or another I made it up.\"[8] Roth later re-used her hands-on-breasts design for the 2013 stage play The Nance,[8] which won that year\\'s Tony Award for costume design.[9]\\nRoth\\'s first Oscar nomination was for 1984\\'s Places in the Heart, set in Depression-era Texas.[10] Roth persuaded Sally Field that, for her \"going-into-town-to-ask-for-a-loan-at-the-bank\" scenes, a 1930s-type crotchless girdle would help her to walk and sit the right way.[2] The costume Oscar that year, however, went to Miloš Forman\\'s Amadeus.[11]\\nRoth\\'s costumes for three distinct time frames in The English Patient (1996) earned her first Oscar. According to producer Saul Zaentz, Roth worked for half her usual salary on the film \"because she believed in the screenplay.\"[12] Roth\\'s research for the costumes included the British Royal Geographical Society archives and 1930s photos of Egypt by photojournalist Lee Miller. Many of the film\\'s varied military uniforms were authentic from the period; others were copied line-for-line from originals by a Savile Row tailor.[13][14]\\nAlso in 1996, Roth did costumes for The Birdcage, a comedy film starring starring Robin Williams  and Nathan Lane as the flamboyant owners of a Florida drag club. Talking about his costume, Williams remembered \"those ballroom pants and the silk shirts with the shoulder pads. The details were amazing. This was a guy who was still living in the ’70s. The clothes captured exactly who Armand was for me.\"[12]\\nHer most-awarded film was 2020\\'s Ma Rainey\\'s Black Bottom, where her costume designs (including flapper costumes and a rubber body suit for Viola Davis based on the body measurements of Aretha Franklin) won the Costume Designers Guild Award for Excellence in Period Film, Britain\\'s BAFTA, and the Academy Award for Best Costume Design.[15]\\nIn the 2023 film Barbie, Roth appears onscreen in a cameo role, portraying and credited as \"the woman on a bench.\" In the scene, Barbie sits down besides Roth and tells the 91 year-old that she is \"so beautiful\", and Roth responds with a smile, \"I know it.\"[2] In a Rolling Stone interview, director Greta Gerwig said that the brief scene \"doesn’t lead anywhere\" but \"If I cut the scene, I don’t know what this movie is about.\"[16] Maureen Dowd in The New York Times described Roth\\'s interaction with Barbie as a \"pivotal scene.\"[2]\\nRoth\\'s more than one hundred screen credits for costume design include The World of Henry Orient, Midnight Cowboy, Klute, Working Girl, Silkwood, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, The Mambo Kings, The Birdcage, Primary Colors, Cold Mountain, Closer, Freedomland, The Good Shepherd, Margot at the Wedding, Mamma Mia!, Evening, and Ma Rainey\\'s Black Bottom.\\nRoth\\'s dozens of stage credits include The Odd Couple, The Star-Spangled Girl, Purlie, Seesaw, They\\'re Playing Our Song, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, Biloxi Blues, Butley, The Vertical Hour, Deuce, and The Waverly Gallery.\\nWork as a costume designer[18]\\nAcademy Awards\\nPrimetime Emmy Awards\\nTony Awards\\n',\n",
       " '\\nIda Julia Pollock (née Crowe;[1] 12 April 1908 – 3 December 2013) was a British writer of several short-stories and over 125 romance novels that were published under her married name, Ida Pollock, and under a number of different pseudonyms: Joan M. Allen; Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Averil Ives, Anita Charles, Barbara Rowan, Jane Beaufort, Rose Burghley, Mary Whistler and Marguerite Bell. She has sold millions of copies over her 90-year career. She has been referred to as the \"world\\'s oldest novelist\" who was still active at 105 and continued writing until her death.[2] On the occasion of her 105th birthday, Pollock was appointed honorary vice-president of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association, having been one of its founding members.[3]\\nIda and her husband, Lt Colonel Hugh Alexander Pollock, DSO (1888–1971), a veteran of war and Winston Churchill\\'s collaborator and editor, had a daughter, Rosemary Pollock, who was also a romance writer. Ida\\'s autobiography, Starlight, published in 2009 at 100 years, tells the story of the start of her career, her marriage, and the relation of her husband with his ex-wife Enid Blyton. She was also an oil painter, who was selected for inclusion in a national exhibition in 2004, at the age of 96.[4]\\nBorn Ida Julia Crowe on 12 April 1908 in Lewisham, Kent, England,[5] she was the daughter of Fanny Osborn, whose father was an architect in Victorian London, and her husband Arthur Crowe, but Pollock claimed to be illegitimate.[6] Still unmarried, her mother began an affair with a supposed Russian duke, but, after her parents\\' death, her mother married Arthur Crowe, an old widower with a distant connection to Lord Nelson. A year or so later her mother resumed her affair with her Russian lover and became pregnant, but her daughter obtained her husband\\'s surname.[6] Her mother lived alone when Pollock was born, and she narrowly escaped being smothered with a pillow by the nurse who attended her birth.[7] Her mother had a difficult time raising her and she was almost adopted by a rich uncle.[6] Encouraged by her mother, she began to write while still at school. At 14, she published her first thriller, The Hills of Raven\\'s Haunt.[citation needed]\\nAt age 20, she was living with her mother in Hastings and already had several stories in major magazines and short novels in print.[8] She visited George Newnes\\'s office in London, to sell her first full-length manuscript;[7] Palanquins and Coloured Lanterns, a novel set in 1920s Shanghai.[8] Six months later, she discovered they had mislaid it.[9] After they found it, she returned to London to meet one of its editors, the 39-year-old Hugh Alexander Pollock (1888–1971), a distinguished veteran of World War I. Hugh had been married since 1924 to his second wife, the popular children\\'s writer Enid Blyton, and was divorced from his first wife, Marion Atkinson, with whom he had two sons, William Cecil Alexander (1914–16) and Edward Alistair (1915–69). George Newnes bought her manuscript and contracted with her to write two more novels.[7] She became a full-time writer in the 1930s, writing short stories under pseudonyms. Ida decided to travel alone to Morocco, after suffering a mental breakdown.[7]\\nDuring World War II, Ida worked at a hostel for girls in London during the Blitz; at this time Hugh, who had left publishing to join the Army, was Commandant of a school for Home Guard officers.[10] Hugh had two daughters with Enid Blyton, Gillian Mary (later Baverstock; 1931–2007) and Imogen Mary (later Smallwood; born 1935), but his marriage had difficulties and his wife began a series of affairs. He offered Ida a post as civilian secretary at the Army Training Centre in the Surrey Hills. During a bungled firearms training session on a firing range, Hugh was hit by shrapnel and Ida contacted Enid, who declined to visit her husband because she was busy and hated hospitals.[7]\\nIn 1941, Enid met Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters, a London surgeon with whom she began another relationship, and the marriage had broken down. In May 1942, while Ida was visiting her mother\\'s home in Hastings a bomb destroyed the house. She escaped unhurt, but her mother was in hospital for two weeks.[7] Hugh paid for Ida to stay at Claridges and he said he was divorcing his wife. To get a quick divorce, Hugh blamed himself for adultery at divorce petition. On 26 October 1943 Ida and Hugh were married at London\\'s Guildhall Register Office, six days after Enid\\'s marriage to Darrell Waters. In 1944 they had a daughter Rosemary Pollock who has also become a romance writer. Enid changed the names of their daughters and Hugh did not see them again, although Enid had promised access as part of his taking the blame for the divorce.[citation needed]\\nAfter World War II, George Newnes, Hugh\\'s old firm, decided not to work with him anymore. They also represented Enid Blyton and were not willing to let her go. After this the marriage experienced financial problems and, in 1950, Hugh had to declare bankruptcy while he struggled with alcoholism. Ida decided to write popular contemporary romances and sold her first novel to Mills & Boon in 1952. Being in print with several major international publishers at the same time, she decided to use multiple pseudonyms. In the 1950s she wrote as Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Rose Burghley, and Mary Whistler to Mills & Boon; as Averil Ives and Barbara Rowan to Ward Lock; as Anita Charles to Wright & Brown; and as Jane Beaufort to Collins. In 1964, she published under her married name, Ida Pollock, her first historical novel, The Gentle Masquerade, and after the success of it, Mills and Boon\\'s \"Masquerade\" series of historical romances was launched.[8] Under her last pseudonym, Marguerite Bell, she also wrote historical romances. Most of her novels have been reprinted by Mills & Boon (or Harlequin in the United States).\\nDuring her marriage she travelled widely and lived in many parts of England. It was their daughter\\'s asthma that brought the Pollocks to Cornwall. They also lived in Ireland, France, Italy, Malta and Switzerland, where they successfully obtained a lasting cure for Rosemary\\'s debilitating condition.[7] Hugh died on 8 November 1971 in Malta, where he is buried in the British military cemetery. After her husband\\'s death, Pollock returned with her daughter to England and they lived for several years in Wiltshire, before moving to Lanreath in 1986. In the 1970s she slowed the rhythm of publication, but continued to write. Besides romances, she published – as Barbara Rowan – a suspense novel, and her novel, A Distant Drum (2005), is based around the Battle of Waterloo. She has been referred to as the \"world\\'s oldest novelist\" who was still active at 105.[11] After her death, her medieval story: Sir Faintheart was published in 2015, and there are still at least two unpublished Regency romances pending publication, including The Runaway.[2]  Today many of her old novels are being reedited.\\nIn addition to writing, Ida constructed model houses, usually scale miniatures of Georgian or Tudor buildings. She was also an oil painter, who was selected for inclusion in a national exhibition in 2004, at the age of 96.[8] But her sight deteriorated and she returned to writing.\\nAfter her 100th birthday, her autobiography, Starlight, was published on 15 November 2009, and she tells the story of the start of her career, her marriage, and the relation of her husband with his ex-wife Enid Blyton.\\nIn 1960 she was a founding member of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association, and in 2010 she helped in its 50th anniversary.[7] On the occasion of her 105th birthday, she was appointed its honorary vice-president.\\nShe died 3 December 2013, aged 105.[12]\\n(* Novels reedited as Ida Pollock)\\n(* Novels reedited as Ida Pollock)\\n',\n",

However, most of her compositions were simply hummed into a tape recorder and translated into a score by a composer.[3] She did, however, tinker with electronic equipment to create the opening theme for Space Patrol, after asking a shop clerk for something that made interesting sounds.[4] In addition to collaborations on Twizzle and Torchy, Leigh teamed with Barry Gray for three musical compositions (Riding My Bike,[5] Sleeping Time[6] and Why?[7]) featured on Vera Lynn\\'s 1955 album \"Songs for Children.\"[8][9] Her surname appears as Lee on the record, but the proper spelling is featured on the sheet music. In addition to two tie-in albums for Twizzle,[10][11] Leigh also reinterpreted the popular stories Cinderella and Jack and the Beanstalk with original songs,[12] plus she wrote and narrated The Wonderful Story of How You Were Born,[13] a frank spoken-word sex education record.\\nThough made in 1964, Paul Starr appeared to be a decade ahead of Space Patrol. A 25-minute marionette puppet series in the same vein as Space Patrol, it was produced in colour. Agent Paul Starr and his crewman, Lightning, work for the Space Bureau of Investigation (SBI). They have a squat rocket, SBI-5, which can travel through space, in air and underwater (SBI uses an undersea base). While jets propel the craft through the air, in space it is powered by \"solar energy\". It is armed with various weapons, including nuclear missiles. The robots of Paul Starr appear to be more developed and fans of Space Patrol will notice the similar sound effects used. The movements of the puppet characters are \"less wooden\" and there is no sign of strings. Only a pilot episode was filmed and shown, but the series was not picked up.\\nThe puppets were made by Martin and Heather Granger who, with Joan Garrick, also operated them. Realistic mouth movements were used long before the arrival of Terrahawks in the 1980s. Actor Edward Bishop provided the voice of Paul Starr; other voices were provided by Patricia English, Dick Vosburgh and Peter Reeves. Besides creating and scripting the series, Leigh also wrote the title song and lyrics (sung by Jerry Dane). Arthur Provis served as director of photography and co-producer.\\nIn this adventure, Starr\\'s boss sends him to Mars where five atomic power stations (used to pump water) have been destroyed by fire. Starr and Lightning work as security guards to try to uncover the cause. The chief suspect is General Darynx. The Martians are shown as non-human fish people.\\nThis was a colour live-action space adventure TV series, produced in 1967, and starred John Garfield, Jr. and Derek Fowlds. Like Paul Starr, its filmed material survives.\\nBooks credited to Roberta Leigh,[14] Rachel Lindsay,[15] Janey Scott or Rozella Lake.

       " 'Alexandra Sellers is a writer and author of 40 contemporary romance novels and a cat language textbook considered by some to be an academic spoof. Her novels have been published in various Harlequin and Silhouette category lines, including Desire, Intrigue, Mills & Boon, Special Releases, Presents, Intimate Moments and Special Edition, as well as by Entangled and Dell. She is best known for her Sons of the Desert sheikh series.\\nSellers became interested in exotic locations when she was 10 and read The Arabian Nights. The book inspired her to begin writing, and she penned her first story called \"Stormy\", a fictionalized account of the life of her cat from the cat\\'s perspective, soon after. Sellers believes that any writer is influenced by every writer they\\'ve read. Sellers\\' favourite authors include Doris Lessing, Jane Austen, Robertson Davies and  romance authors such as Jane Donnelly and Mary Burchell. Among books that have strongly influenced her are The Sufis by Idries Shah, The Thousand and One Nights translated by Richard Burton, Mansfield Park, Pride and Prejudice and Persuasion, by Jane Austen. In poetry she admires Icons of Flesh by Glen Sorestad, The Pig Poets: An Anthology of Porcine Poesy by Henry Hogge.[1]\\nSellers has studied eight foreign languages, including French, German, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, and Italian. She attended the School of Oriental and African Studies, or SOAS, a public research university located in London, United Kingdom that specializes in arts and humanities, languages, laws and social sciences relating to Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Sellers was the first student to study for a double degree in Persian and Religious Studies; she was awarded First Class Honours.[2] She also studied Hebrew in Israel, Persian in Iran, and Arabic in Yemen.\\nIn her first attempt, Sellers submitted both a romantic short story and a science fiction short story to publishers. \"Dear Aunt Martha\" sold immediately, but the science fiction story was rejected by the first publisher who received it. Sellers took this as a sign to concentrate on the romance genre.[2]\\nHer first full-length novel was published in 1980, and after this Sellers became a full-time writer. Many of her novels are set in exotic locations, some of them fictional countries.[2] Romantic Times has described her novels as \"enchanting...superbly integrating a memorable plot, delightful characters, and tender emotion.\"[3]\\nIt has been said that \"There is no better illustration of the changing and evolving sensibilities of the time, in fact, than the three novels Sellers wrote for the Silhouette Intimate Moments line -- The Real Man, The Male Chauvinist, and The Old Flame....What Sellers is really writing about, however, are the socially constructed perceptions of sexuality and gender that serve to make men the enemies of women (and sometimes the reverse), and which often hide our real values, motives, and feelings even from ourselves.\"[4]\\nIn 1997, her novel A Nice Girl Like You was nominated by Romantic Times for a Reviewers\\' Choice Award for Best Silhouette Yours Truly.[5] Three years later she received the Romantic Times Career Achievement Award for Series Romantic Fantasy,[6] and in 2009 she received the Romantic Times Career Achievement Best Author Award for Series.[7]\\nSellers has studied the language of cats, and published her findings in the book Spoken Cat and Relevant Factors in Worldview. According to her book, \"here is your milk\" is \"birr pirp r\\'mow\" when translated into cat speak. \"Here are a few tidbits,\" meanwhile, becomes \"mRRah mRRah pirp r\\'mow.\"[8]  She also believes that cats have their own body of myths and folklore. She says that the cats have told her that they came from Canopus (the second brightest star after Sirius) to educate humanity on cleanliness. In particular, they believe that we should use our excrement as fertiliser, instead of disposing of it in our drinking water.[9]\\nDiana White, of The Boston Globe, described the book as \"an elaborate, beautifully executed joke that not only pokes fun at the cat-human connection, but at language texts, too....Clearly, Sellers knows cats.\"[10]  The SOAS Magazine stated that \"Supporters of the \\'pet as human companion\\' theory will see in the book the answer to their prayers.\"[11]\\nBorn and raised in Canada,[12]  Alexandra Sellers once attempted to calculate how many different places she has lived throughout her life. She gave up when she reached forty homes in twelve towns in five countries, including Canada, the UK, Israel, Spain, and Greece. But she says she hasn\\'t visited nearly as many places as she\\'d like yet.[13] She currently divides her time between London, Crete, and Vancouver.\\nHer favourite cat was an \"extraordinarily intelligent and wonderful white cat\" who was kidnapped one day by vivisectionists.  Other favourite cats include Medico, a purebred Siamese, and Monsieur, a tabby.[citation needed]\\nSpoken Cat and Relevant Factors in Worldview (1997)\\n',\n",

In 2003, Katherine was chosen as Britain’s 95th best-loved novel of all time in a nationwide poll conducted by the BBC.[6]\\nHer 1962 novel Devil Water concerns James, the luckless Earl of Derwentwater and his involvement with the Jacobite rising of 1715. She also narrates the story of his brother Charles, beheaded after the 1745 rebellion, the last man to die for the cause. The action of the novel moves back and forth between Northumberland, Tyneside, London, and the United States. Seton stated that the book developed out of her love for Northumberland. She certainly visited her Snowdon cousins at Felton. Billy Pigg, the celebrated Northumbrian piper played \"Derwentwater\\'s Farewell\" especially for her. The novel shows her typical thorough research of events and places, though the accents are a little wayward. Seton said that her greatest debt of all was to Miss Amy Flagg of Westoe Village in South Shields, her father\\'s birthplace.[7]\\nIn 1904, Seton was born in Manhattan to English-born naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton and American travel writer Grace Gallatin Seton Thompson.[2][3] She grew up in Cos Cob, Connecticut, in a wealthy family.[2][4]\\nSeton married twice. Her first marriage at the age of 19 was to Rhodes scholar Hamilton Cottier. They had two children,[2] Pamela and Seton Cottier.[5] Her second marriage was to investment counselor Hamilton (Chan) M. Chase in 1930. Together they had one daughter,[2] Clemency, and they divorced in 1968.[8]\\nShe died in Old Greenwich, Connecticut,[3] and was survived by two daughters, five grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.[4] She is interred at Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nSidney Sheldon (February 11, 1917 – January 30, 2007) was an American writer. He was prominent in the 1930s, first working on Broadway plays, and then in motion pictures, notably writing the successful comedy The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer (1947), which earned him an Oscar in 1948.[1] He went on to work in television, where over twenty years he created The Patty Duke Show (1963–66), I Dream of Jeannie (1965–70), and Hart to Hart (1979–84).[2] After turning 50, he began writing best-selling romantic suspense novels, such as Master of the Game (1982), The Other Side of Midnight (1973), and Rage of Angels (1980). \\nSheldon\\'s novels have sold over 300 million copies in 51 languages.[3] Sheldon is consistently cited as one of the top ten best-selling fiction writers of all time.[4]\\nSheldon was born Sidney Schechtel in Chicago, Illinois. His parents, of Ukrainian Jewish ancestry, were Ascher \"Otto\" Schechtel (1894–1967), manager of a jewelry store, and Natalie Marcus. At age 10, Sidney made his first sale, $5 for a poem. During the Great Depression, he worked at a variety of jobs, and after graduating from East High School in Denver, Colorado, he attended Northwestern University on a scholarship, and contributed short plays to drama groups. He had to drop out after six months to help support his family.[5] Sheldon enlisted in the military during World War II as a pilot in the War Training Service, a branch of the Army Air Corps.[6] His unit was disbanded, but he was discharged because of a recurring slipped disc before he was deployed.[7]\\nIn 1937, Sheldon moved to Hollywood,  where he reviewed scripts and collaborated on a number of B movies.[6]\\nSheldon began writing musicals for the Broadway stage while continuing to write screenplays for both MGM Studios and Paramount Pictures. He earned a reputation as a prolific writer; for example, at one time, Ben Roberts and he had three musicals on Broadway - a rewritten The Merry Widow, Jackpot, and Dream with Music.[8] Sheldon received a Tony Award in 1959 for his musical Redhead, starring Gwen Verdon.[9] His other stage plays include Alice in Arms, The King of New York, The Judge, and Roman Candle. Only Roman Candle has been published as a book. The play Gomes was performed only in London and not on Broadway.\\nSheldon\\'s success on Broadway brought him back to Hollywood, where his first assignment was The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer, which earned him the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1947.[10] He was one of the writers on the screenplay for the 1948 musical film Easter Parade and sole writer for the 1950 musical film Annie Get Your Gun, both of which featured the songs of Irving Berlin.[11] Some of his other writing credits include South of Panama, Gambling Daughters, Dangerous Lady, Borrowed Hero, Mr. District Attorney in the Carter Case, Fly-by-Night, She\\'s in the Army, Nancy Goes to Rio, Three Guys Named Mike, No questions asked, Rich, Young and Pretty, Just This Once, Remains to be Seen, Dream Wife (directed as well), You\\'re Never Too Young, The Birds and the Bees, Anything Goes, Pardners, The Buster Keaton Story (directed as well), All in a Night\\'s Work, and Billy Rose\\'s Jumbo.\\nWhen television became the new popular medium, Sheldon decided to try his hand in it. \"I suppose I needed money,\" he remembered. \"I met Patty Duke one day at lunch. So I produced The Patty Duke Show, and I did something nobody else in TV ever did. For seven years, I wrote almost every single episode of the series.\"[8]\\nAfter seeing Duke\\'s performance as Helen Keller in The Miracle Worker (1962), Sheldon cast the actress as the two sitcom leads, identical cousins, Patty and Cathy Lane.[12] Following the show\\'s success, Sheldon had signed an agreement with Screen Gems to handle the development of various television series.[13]\\nIn 1965, Sheldon created, produced, and wrote I Dream of Jeannie starring Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman.[14] He wrote all but two dozen scripts in five years, sometimes using three pseudonyms (Mark Rowane, Allan Devon, and Christopher Golato) while simultaneously writing scripts for The Patty Duke Show. He later said that he did this because he felt his name was appearing too often in the credits as creator, producer, copyright owner, and writer of these series.[15]\\nProduction for I Dream of Jeannie ended in 1970 after five seasons.  \"During the last year of I Dream of Jeannie, I decided to try a novel,\" he said in 1982. \"Each morning from 9 until noon, I had a secretary at the studio take all calls. I mean every single call. I wrote each morning — or rather, dictated — and then I faced the TV business.\"[8]\\nIn 1970, Sheldon wrote all 17 episodes of the short-lived series Nancy.[16]\\nIn 1979, Sheldon created and wrote for the series Hart to Hart starring Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers.[17] The show aired on ABC and ran for five seasons.[18]\\nIn 1969, Sheldon wrote his first novel, The Naked Face, which earned him a nomination for the Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America in the category of Best First Novel. His next novel, The Other Side of Midnight, climbed to number one on The New York Times Best Seller list, as did several ensuing novels, a number of which were also made into motion pictures or TV miniseries. His novels often featured determined women who persevere in a tough world run by hostile men.[8] The novels contained  suspense and devices to keep the reader turning the page:[8]\\n\"I try to write my books so the reader can\\'t put them down,\" he explained in a 1982 interview. \"I try to construct them so when the reader gets to the end of it, he or she has to read just one more chapter. It\\'s the technique of the old Saturday afternoon serial: leave the guy hanging on the edge of the cliff at the end of the chapter.\"Most of his readers were women.[8] Asked why this was the case, he said: \"I like to write about women who are talented and capable, but most important, retain their femininity. Women have tremendous power — their femininity, because men can\\'t do without it.\"[8] Books were Sheldon\\'s favorite medium. \"I love writing books,\" he commented. \"Movies are a collaborative medium, and everyone is second-guessing you. When you do a novel, you\\'re on your own. It\\'s a freedom that doesn\\'t exist in any other medium.\"[8] He was the author of 18 novels, which have sold over 300 million copies.\\nThree years before his death, the Los Angeles Times called Sheldon \"Mr. Blockbuster\" and \"prince of potboilers.\"[19]\\nSheldon was first married to Jane Kaufman Harding (1945–1946). Later, he wrote, \"Regretfully, in less than a month, Jane and I realized we had made a mistake. We spent the next nine months trying in vain to make the marriage work.\"[20]\\nHe was married for thirty years to Jorja Curtright, a stage and film actress, who later became an interior designer.[21] She played Suzanne in the 1955 film, Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing, and appeared as Madame Zolta in season one of I Dream of Jeannie[22] in episode 25, \"Bigger Than a Bread Box\".[23] Curtright died of a heart attack in 1985. Their daughter, Mary Sheldon, became a novelist as well.[24][25]\\nSheldon married Alexandra Joyce Kostoff, a former child actress,[26][27] in Las Vegas in 1989.[28]\\nSheldon struggled with bipolar disorder for years; he contemplated suicide at 17 (talked out of it by his father, who found him with a bottle of whiskey and several bottles of sleeping pills), as detailed in his autobiography published in 2005, The Other Side of Me.[29]\\nA resident of Palm Springs, California,[30] Sheldon died on January 30, 2007, of pneumonia at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, California, twelve days before his 90th birthday.[6][1] His remains were cremated; the ashes were interred in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.\\nSheldon won an Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay (1947) for The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer and a Tony Award (1959) for his musical Redhead, and was nominated for an Emmy Award for his work on I Dream of Jeannie, an NBC sitcom. Sheldon was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1988[31] had a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars dedicated to him in 1994.[32] In 1990, Sheldon received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[33]\\nThese books were published to introduce English-language novels in Japan.

       " 'LaVyrle Spencer (born July 17, 1943) is an American best-selling author of contemporary and historical romance novels. She has successfully published a number of books, with several of them made into movies.  Twelve of her books have been New York Times bestsellers, and Spencer was inducted into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame in 1988.  She retired from writing in 1997.\\nSpencer was born on July 17, 1943, in Browerville, Minnesota, where she was raised.[1] Shortly after her high school graduation Spencer married her high school sweetheart Dan Spencer. They have just celebrated their 61st wedding anniversary (married in February 1962). The two had three daughters, Sarah, Amy and Beth (Beth unfortunately passed in 1990 and Amy in 2018 unexpectedly), and are grandparents to Spencer and Logan Kimball. They lived in a Victorian house in Stillwater, Minnesota until selling their family home in 2011.  They now live in North Oaks MN, where Spencer enjoys gardening, cooking, playing bass guitar and electric piano, and photography.\\nAlthough she showed a flair for writing during high school, Spencer didn\\'t begin her first novel until she was in her thirties, working as a teacher\\'s aide at Osseo Junior High School, she had read \"The Flame and The Flower\" by the bestselling author Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, which gave her the idea to become a novelist. She decided to try transferring to paper a recurring dream she was having about a story based on her grandmother\\'s lifestyle on a Minnesota farm.  She awoke at 4:00\\xa0a.m. one morning, and quickly began writing down her story in a three-ring notebook.  This story became her first novel, The Fulfillment.\\nShe sent her manuscript to best-selling novelist Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, who read it and promptly mailed it to her own editor at Avon.  The editor purchased the novel, which was published in 1979.  The Fulfillment was very different from the historical romance \"bodice-rippers\" which were popular at the time.  Unlike the other novels, Spencer\\'s debut work did not include any grand adventures, and featured a \"nice man\" instead of a more overbearing hero.[2]\\nSpencer\\'s second novel, Hummingbird, was rejected by her editor at Avon and also by another editor at Jove, although Jove later published the novel in 1983.  Both publishing companies faulted the book for having too much humor and for being too narrow in scope, as the bulk of the book was set within a single house.  Spencer opined that \"drama happens within, in the emotional impact on the characters,\" and refused to dramatically rewrite the book.[2]\\nAvon likewise rejected Spencer\\'s third book, The Endearment, about a mail-order bride and her husband, who, unlike most heroes, was a virgin.  Avon was leery of this book because it made the hero, not the heroine, the protagonist.  The Endearment was later published by Pocket Books.[2]\\nIn these early years Spencer also wrote four category romances.  She later stopped writing these shorter novels because she was disappointed with the short shelf life, generally only one month, allotted to the category romance.[2]\\nSpencer\\'s novels were highly successful, consistently selling over 1.5 million copies in paperback and over 400,000 copies in hardcover.  In 1997, she released her twenty-third and last novel, Then Came Heaven.  She told Publishers Weekly that she had always intended to write until she reached a set financial goal, at which point she would retire in order to travel and spend time with her family.  After meeting that goal, she retired.[3]\\nSpencer is known for creating realistic characters and stories that focus on families rather than only the relationship between a man and woman. These \"ordinary\" men and women are warm and vulnerable and are always portrayed sympathetically.[2] Her heroines tend to be a mix of fire and warmth, strength, savvy and tenderheartedness who must overcome some sort of adversity, such as pregnancy, divorce, a lengthy separation, the loss of a loved one, and then undergo a catharsis. The stories center on themes of abiding love, family ties and strength in difficult times.\\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Spencer wrote twelve New York Times Bestsellers. Her books have been sold to book clubs worldwide, and have been published around the world.  Condensed versions of many of her novels have appeared in Reader\\'s Digest and Good Housekeeping.\\nSpencer has won five Romance Writers of America RITA Awards, the highest award presented to romance novelists.  Four of her wins came in the category Best Single-Title Historical Romance, and were for the novels, The Endearment (1983), Hummingbird (1984), Twice Loved (1985), and The Gamble (1988).  She also won a RITA Award in 1990 for Best Romance of 1989 for her romance Morning Glory. Because she won three RITAs in a single category, Spencer was inducted into the RWA Hall of Fame in 1988, becoming one of only twelve women (as of September 2009) to have been so honored.[4][5]\\nSpencer has also made the leap from page to screen. Her first novel, The Fulfillment, was developed as a CBS TV movie starring Cheryl Ladd and Morning Glory, which Spencer wrote in 1989, was released as a major motion picture under the same title, starring Deborah Raffin and Christopher Reeve. Spencer and her husband appear as extras in the film.\\nIn a television deal that Variety called “precedent–setting,”[6] CBS TV produced two of Spencer\\'s books for television movies, with an option on a third. Home Song, the first book produced by CBS TV, starring Lee Horsley, Polly Draper, and Deborah Raffin, aired in April 1996.[7]  The second, Family Blessings, starred Lynda Carter, and was directed by Deborah Raffin and Nina Foch.[8] The network also bought the rights to first look at 11 other Spencer novels, as well as pre–cable broadcast rights to the theatrical film of her novel Morning Glory.[6]\\n\\n',\n",

Her father was a town marshal, although he, along with her uncle Jake \"Jiggs\" Lael also competed on the rodeo circuit.[1] A voracious reader, Linda began writing her own stories when she was 10.[2]  As a child, Linda often visited with an elderly neighbor and listened to stories of her neighbor\\'s experiences meeting outlaw Jesse James and witnessing a gunfight involving the Dalton Brothers.[1]  Lael graduated from high school in Northport, WA but did not attend college.[2]   After her marriage, Miller spent 10 years living in Spokane before moving away.

       " '\\nDanielle Fernandes Dominique Schuelein-Steel (born August 14, 1947) is an American writer, best known for her romance novels. She is the bestselling living author and one of the best-selling fiction authors of all time, with over 800\\xa0million copies sold.[3] As of 2021, she has written 190 books, including over 140[4] novels.\\nBased in California for most of her career, Steel has produced several books a year, often juggling up to five projects at once. All of her novels have been bestsellers, including those issued in hardback, despite \"a resounding lack of critical acclaim\" (Publishers Weekly).[5] Her books often involve rich families facing a crisis, threatened by dark elements such as prison, fraud, blackmail and suicide. Steel has also published children\\'s fiction and poetry, as well as creating a foundation that funds mental illness-related organizations.[6] Her books have been translated into 43 languages,[7] with 22 adapted for television, including two that have received Golden Globe nominations.\\nSteel was born Danielle Fernandes Dominique Schuelein-Steel in New York City to a German father and a Portuguese mother. Her father, John Schuelein-Steel, was a German-Jewish immigrant and a descendant of owners of Löwenbräu beer. Her mother, Norma da Camara Stone dos Reis, was the daughter of a Portuguese diplomat.[8][9][10][11]  She spent much of her childhood in France,[12] where from an early age she was included in her parents\\' dinner parties, giving her an opportunity to observe the habits and lives of the wealthy and famous.[10] Her parents divorced when she was eight, and she was raised primarily by her father, rarely seeing her mother.[8]\\nSteel started writing stories as a child, and by her late teens had begun writing poetry.[13] Raised Catholic, she thought of becoming a nun during her early years.[14] A 1965 graduate of the Lycée Français de New York,[15] she studied literature design and fashion design,[13] first at Parsons School of Design and then at New York University.[16]\\nWhile still attending New York University, Steel began writing, completing her first manuscript at 19.[13] Steel worked for a public-relations agency in New York called Supergirls. A client, Ladies\\' Home Journal editor John Mack Carter, encouraged her to focus on writing,[11] having been impressed with her freelance articles. He suggested she write a book, which she did. She later moved to San Francisco and worked as a copywriter for Grey Advertising.\\nHer first novel, Going Home, was published in 1973. The novel contained many of the themes that her writing would become well known for, including a focus on family issues and human relationships. Her relationship with her second husband influenced Passion\\'s Promise and Now and Forever, the two novels that launched her career.[11] With the success of her fourth book, The Promise, she became a participant in San Francisco high society.[11]\\nBeginning in 1981, Steel had become a near-permanent fixture on The New York Times hardcover and paperback bestsellers lists. In 1989, she was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for having a book on the New York Times Bestseller List for the most consecutive weeks of any author—381 consecutive weeks at that time.[17] Steel is a prolific author, often releasing several books per year.[17] Each book takes 2½ years to complete,[13] so Steel has developed an ability to juggle up to five projects at once, researching one book while outlining another, then writing and editing additional books.[17] Since her first book was published, every one of her novels has hit bestseller lists in paperback, and each one released in hardback has also been a hardback bestseller.[8]\\nDuring this time, Steel also expanded to non-fiction work. Having a Baby was published in 1984 and featured a chapter by Steel about suffering through miscarriage.[18] The same year she published a book of poetry, Love: Poems.[19] She also ventured into children\\'s fiction, penning a series of 10 illustrated books for young readers. These books, known as the \"Max and Martha\" series, aim to help children face real-life problems: new baby, new school, loss of loved one, etc. In addition, Steel has authored the \"Freddie\" series. These four books address other real-life situations: first night away from home, trip to the doctor, etc.[19]\\nIn 1993, Steel sued writer Lorenzo Bene, who had intended to disclose in his book that her son Nick was adopted by her then-current husband John Traina, despite the fact that adoption records are sealed in California.[8] A San Francisco judge made a highly unusual ruling allowing the seal on Nick\\'s adoption to be overturned, although he was still a minor. This order was confirmed by a California Appellate Judge, who ruled that because Steel was famous, her son\\'s adoption did not have the same privacy right,[8] and the book was allowed to be published.[20]\\nAfter years of near-constant writing, in 2003 Steel opened an art gallery in San Francisco, Steel Gallery, which showed contemporary work and exhibited the paintings and sculptures of emerging artists. The gallery closed in 2007.[21] She continues to curate shows a few times a year for the Andrea Schwartz Gallery in San Francisco.\\nIn 2002, Steel was decorated by the French government as an Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, for her contributions to world culture.\\nShe has additionally received:\\nIn 2006 Steel reached an agreement with Elizabeth Arden to launch a new perfume, Danielle by Danielle Steel.\\nSteel married French-American banker Claude-Eric Lazard in 1965 at age 18 and gave birth to their daughter Beatrix.[22] Steel and Lazard separated in 1972. While still married to Lazard, Steel met Danny Zugelder while interviewing an inmate in a prison near Lompoc, California, where Zugelder was also incarcerated. He moved in with Steel when he was paroled in June 1973, but returned to prison in early 1974 on robbery and rape charges. After receiving her divorce from Lazard in 1975, she married Zugelder in the prison canteen. During their relationship, Steel suffered multiple miscarriages. She divorced Zugelder in 1978.[23]\\nSteel married her third husband, William George Toth, in 1978, while pregnant with his child, Nick. They divorced in March 1981.\\nSteel married for the fourth time in 1981, to vintner John Traina.[24] Traina adopted Steel\\'s son Nick and gave him his family name. Together they had additional five children, Samantha, Victoria, Vanessa,[25] a fashion stylist, Maxx, and Zara.[22][24]  Determined to spend as much time as possible with her children, Steel often wrote at night, making do with only four hours of sleep.[8] Steel and Traina divorced in 1995.[26]\\nHer fear of flying created many challenges in the early 1980s; she went through an eight-week course based at the San Francisco airport to overcome her fear.[27]\\nSteel married for a fifth time, to Silicon Valley financier Thomas James Perkins, but the marriage ended after four years in 2002.[28] Steel has said that her novel The Klone and I was inspired by a private joke between herself and Perkins.[29] In 2006, Perkins dedicated his novel Sex and the Single Zillionaire to Steel.\\nSteel\\'s longtime residence was in San Francisco,[30] but she now spends most of her time at a second home in Paris.[31]  Her 55-room San Francisco home, Spreckels Mansion, was built in c.1912 as the mansion of sugar tycoon Adolph B. Spreckels.[32]\\nDespite her public image and varied pursuits, Steel is known to be shy[30] and because of that and her desire to protect her children from the tabloids,[8] she rarely grants interviews or makes public appearances.[33]\\nSteel\\'s son, Nick Traina, died by suicide in 1997. Traina was the lead singer of San Francisco punk bands Link 80 and Knowledge. To honor his memory, Steel wrote the nonfiction book His Bright Light, about Nick\\'s life and death. Proceeds of the book, which reached The New York Times Non-Fiction Bestseller List,[19] were used to found the Nick Traina Foundation, which Steel runs, to fund organizations dedicated to treating mental accessibility issues.[34] To gain more recognition for children\\'s mental health, Steel has lobbied for legislation in Washington, and previously held a fundraiser every two years (known as The Star Ball) in San Francisco.[35] In 2002, she founded Yo Angel Foundation to assist the homeless.[36]\\nSteel\\'s novels, often described as \"formulaic,\"[37] tend to involve the characters in a crisis that threatens their relationship. The novels sometimes explore the world of the rich and famous[37] and frequently deal with serious life issues like illness, death, loss, family crises, and relationships. Also, there are claims that her popular story lines are based on the events of her life.[5] Despite a reputation among critics for writing \"fluff\", Steel often delves into the less savory aspects of human nature, including incest, suicide, divorce, war, and even the Holocaust.[17] As time has progressed, Steel\\'s writing has evolved. Her later heroines tend to be stronger and more authoritative, who, if they do not receive the level of respect and attention they desire from a man, move on to a new life.[22] In recent years Steel has also been willing to take more risks with her plots. Ransom focuses more on suspense than romance, and follows three sets of seemingly unconnected characters as their lives begin to intersect.[38] Toxic Bachelors departs from her usual style by telling the story through the eyes of the three title characters, men who are relationship phobic and ultimately discover their true loves.[37]\\nTo avoid comparisons to her previous novels, Steel does not write sequels.[13] Although many of her earliest books were released with initial print runs of 1 million copies, by 2004 her publisher had decreased the number of books initially printed to 650,000 due to the decline in book purchasing. However, her fan base was still extremely strong at that time, with Steel\\'s books selling out atop charts worldwide.[39]\\nTwenty-two of her books have been adapted for television,[40] including two that have received Golden Globe nominations. One is Jewels, the story of the survival of a woman and her children in World War II Europe, and the family\\'s eventual rebirth as one of the greatest jewelry houses in Europe.[17] Columbia Pictures was the first movie studio to make an offer for one of her novels, purchasing the rights to The Ghost in 1998.[40] Steel also reached an agreement with New Line Home Entertainment in 2005 to sell the film rights to 30 of her novels for DVDs.[41]\\nSteel spends two to three years on each book, juggling multiple projects at once. According to Steel, once she has an idea for a story, her first step is to make notes, which are mostly about the characters. She told The New York Times in 2018: \"I make notes for a while before I start work on the outline. The notes are usually more about the characters. I need to know the characters really well before I start — who they are, how they think, how they feel, what has happened to them, how they grew up.\"[42] In a 2019 interview with The Guardian, she reported often spending 20- to 30-hour periods on her typewriter, gaining her attention and criticism.[43][44]\\nSteel has written all of her novels on Olympia SG1 standard typewriters. She has two that she primarily writes on:  one at her home in San Francisco and another at her home in Paris.[45] Her typewriter at her home in San Francisco has been in her possession since she bought it while working on her first book. According to Steel, she bought it second hand for $20.\\nDanielle Steel has written more than 185 books, including over 141 novels.[46] Her books have been translated into 43 languages and can be found in 69 countries across the globe.[7]\\nHer works consist of novels, non-fiction, picture books, and two series of children\\'s books: the Max & Martha series and the Freddie series.\\n',\n",

She also wrote children\\'s books and poetry, but may be best known for her Merlin series, which straddles the boundary between the historical novel and fantasy.\\nMary Florence Elinor Rainbow was born on 17 September 1916 in Sunderland, County Durham, England, UK, daughter of Mary Edith Matthews, a primary school teacher from New Zealand, and Frederick Albert Rainbow, a vicar.[1][2]\\nShe was a bright child and attended Eden Hall boarding school in Penrith, Cumbria, age eight. She was bullied there and stated that this had a lasting effect on her. At ten, she won a scholarship to Skellfield School, Ripon, Yorkshire, where she excelled at sport. Offered places by Oxford, Cambridge, and Durham universities, she chose Durham as it offered the largest bursary and least travel.[3]\\nShe graduated from Durham University in 1938 with first-class honours in English, was awarded a first-class Teaching Diploma in English with Art the following year and in 1941 gained her master\\'s degree.[4]\\nStewart held a variety of posts during World War II, including primary school teaching, teaching at secondary level at a girls\\' boarding school, and working part-time at the sixth form of Durham School.[4] Between 1941 and 1956, she was an assistant lecturer (1941–5) and part-time lecturer (1948–56) in English literature, mostly Anglo-Saxon, at Durham University. She received an honorary D.Litt. in 2009.[5] It was in Durham that she met and married her husband, Frederick Stewart, a young Scot who lectured in Geology. She became known as Mary Stewart.\\nIn 1956, the couple moved to Edinburgh.[6] Mary, in her own words, was a \"born storyteller\" and had been writing stories since the age of three. Following the move to Scotland, she submitted a novel to the publishers Hodder & Stoughton. Madam, Will You Talk? was an immediate success, followed by many other successful works over the years.[3]\\nStewart was the best-selling author of many romantic suspense and historical fiction novels. They were well received by critics, due especially to her skillful story-telling and elegant prose. Her novels are also known for their well-crafted settings, many in England but also in such locations as Damascus and the Greek islands, as well as Spain, France, Austria, etc.[7]\\nShe was at the height of her popularity from the late 1950s to the 1980s, when many of her novels were translated into other languages. The Moon-Spinners, one of her most popular novels, was also made into a Walt Disney live-action movie.  Stewart was one of the most prominent writers of the romantic suspense subgenre, blending romance novels and mystery. Critically, her works are considered superior to those of other acclaimed romantic suspense novelists, such as Victoria Holt and Phyllis Whitney.[8] She seamlessly combined the two genres, maintaining a full mystery while focusing on the courtship between two people,[9] so that the process of solving the mystery \"helps to illuminate\" the hero\\'s personality—thereby helping the heroine to fall in love with him.[10]\\nIn the late 1960s a new generation of young readers revived a readership in T. H. White\\'s The Once and Future King (published in full 1958) and The Lord of the Rings (published in full 1956), and as a consequence Arthurian and heroic legends regained popularity among a critical mass of readers. Mary Stewart added to this climate by publishing The Crystal Cave (1970), the first in what was to become The Merlin Trilogy, later extended by two further novels. The books placed Stewart on the best-seller list many times throughout the 1970s and 1980s.\\nMary Rainbow met and married her husband, Frederick Stewart, a young Scot lecturer in Geology, whilst they were both working at Durham University. They were married by her father in September 1945 after having met at a VE Day dance; [3]their engagement was announced in The Times only one month after they met.[11] At 30, she suffered an ectopic pregnancy, undiagnosed for several weeks, and as a consequence could not have children.\\nIn 1956, they moved to Edinburgh, where he became professor of geology and mineralogy, and later chairman of the Geology Department at University of Edinburgh.[6]\\nIn 1974, Mary\\'s husband Frederick Stewart was knighted and she became Lady Stewart, although she never used the title.

       " '\\nAbraham Stoker (8 November 1847\\xa0– 20 April 1912) was an Irish author who wrote the 1897 Gothic horror novel Dracula. During his lifetime, he was better known as the personal assistant of actor Sir Henry Irving and business manager of the West End\\'s Lyceum Theatre, which Irving owned.\\nIn his early years, Stoker worked as a theatre critic for an Irish newspaper, and wrote stories as well as commentaries. He also enjoyed travelling, particularly to Cruden Bay in Scotland where he set two of his novels. During another visit to the English coastal town of Whitby, Stoker drew inspiration for writing Dracula. He died on 20 April 1912 due to locomotor ataxia and was cremated in north London. Since his death, his magnum opus Dracula has become one of the best-known works in English literature, and the novel has been adapted for numerous films, short stories, and plays.[1]\\nStoker was born on 8 November 1847 at 15 Marino Crescent, Clontarf, on the northside of Dublin, Ireland.[2] The park adjacent to the house is now known as Bram Stoker Park.[3] His parents were Abraham Stoker (1799–1876) from Dublin and Charlotte Mathilda Blake Thornley (1818–1901), who was raised in County Sligo.[4] Stoker was the third of seven children, the eldest of whom was Sir Thornley Stoker, 1st Bt.[5] Abraham and Charlotte were members of the Church of Ireland Parish of Clontarf and attended the parish church with their children, who were baptised there.[6] Abraham was a senior civil servant.\\nStoker was bedridden with an unknown illness until he started school at the age of seven, when he made a complete recovery. Of this time, Stoker wrote, \"I was naturally thoughtful, and the leisure of long illness gave opportunity for many thoughts which were fruitful according to their kind in later years.\" He was privately educated at Bective House school run by the Reverend (William Woods).[7][8]\\nAfter his recovery, he grew up without further serious illnesses, even excelling as an athlete at Trinity College, Dublin, which he attended from 1864 to 1870. He graduated with a BA in 1870, and paid to receive his MA in 1875. Though he later in life recalled graduating \"with honours in mathematics\", this appears to have been a mistake.[9] He was named University Athlete, participating in multiple sports, including playing rugby for Dublin University. He was auditor of the College Historical Society (the Hist) and president of the University Philosophical Society (he remains the only student in Trinity\\'s history to hold both positions), where his first paper was on Sensationalism in Fiction and Society.\\nStoker became interested in the theatre while a student through his friend Dr. Maunsell. While working for the Irish Civil Service, he became the theatre critic for the Dublin Evening Mail,[10] which was co-owned by Sheridan Le Fanu, an author of Gothic tales. Theatre critics were held in low esteem at the time, but Stoker attracted notice by the quality of his reviews. In December 1876, he gave a favourable review of Henry Irving\\'s Hamlet at the Theatre Royal in Dublin. Irving invited Stoker for dinner at the Shelbourne Hotel where he was staying, and they became friends. Stoker also wrote stories, and \"Crystal Cup\" was published by the London Society in 1872, followed by \"The Chain of Destiny\" in four parts in The Shamrock. In 1876, while a civil servant in Dublin, Stoker wrote the non-fiction book The Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland (published 1879), which remained a standard work.[7] Furthermore, he possessed an interest in art and was a founder of the Dublin Sketching Club in 1879.\\nIn 1878, Stoker married Florence Balcombe, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel James Balcombe of 1 Marino Crescent.  She was a celebrated beauty whose former suitor had been Oscar Wilde.[11] Stoker had known Wilde from his student days, having proposed him for membership of the university\\'s Philosophical Society while he was president. Wilde was upset at Florence\\'s decision, but Stoker later resumed the acquaintanceship, and, after Wilde\\'s fall, visited him on the Continent.[12]\\nThe Stokers moved to London, where Stoker became acting manager and then business manager of Irving\\'s Lyceum Theatre in the West End, a post he held for 27 years.[13] On 31 December 1879, Bram and Florence\\'s only child was born, a son whom they christened Irving Noel Thornley Stoker. The collaboration with Henry Irving was important for Stoker and through him, he became involved in London\\'s high society, where he met James Abbott McNeill Whistler and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (to whom he was distantly related). Working for Irving, the most famous actor of his time, and managing one of the most successful theatres in London made Stoker a notable if busy man. He was dedicated to Irving and his memoirs show he idolised him. In London, Stoker also met Hall Caine, who became one of his closest friends – he dedicated Dracula to him.\\nIn the course of Irving\\'s tours, Stoker travelled the world, although he never visited Eastern Europe, a setting for his most famous novel. Stoker enjoyed the United States, where Irving was popular. With Irving he was invited twice to the White House, and knew William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. Stoker set two of his novels in America, and used Americans as characters, the most notable being Quincey Morris. He also met one of his literary idols, Walt Whitman, having written to him in 1872 an extraordinary letter[14] that some have interpreted as the expression of a deeply-suppressed homosexuality.[15][16]\\nStoker was a regular visitor to Cruden Bay in Scotland between 1892 and 1910. His month-long holidays to the Aberdeenshire coastal village provided a large portion of available time for writing his books. Two novels were set in Cruden Bay: The Watter\\'s Mou\\' (1895) and The Mystery of the Sea (1902). He started writing Dracula there in 1895 while in residence at the Kilmarnock Arms Hotel. The guest book with his signatures from 1894 and 1895 still survives. The nearby Slains Castle (also known as New Slains Castle) is linked with Bram Stoker and plausibly provided the visual palette for the descriptions of Castle Dracula during the writing phase. A distinctive room in Slains Castle, the octagonal hall, matches the description of the octagonal room in Castle Dracula.[17]\\nStoker visited the English coastal town of Whitby in 1890, and that visit was said to be part of the inspiration for Dracula.[18] Count Dracula comes ashore at Whitby, and in the shape of a black dog runs up the 199 steps to the graveyard of St Mary\\'s Church in the shadow of the Whitby Abbey ruins.[19] Stoker began writing novels while working as manager for Irving and secretary and director of London\\'s Lyceum Theatre, beginning with The Snake\\'s Pass in 1890 and Dracula in 1897. During this period, he was part of the literary staff of The Daily Telegraph in London, and he wrote other fiction, including the horror novels The Lady of the Shroud (1909) and The Lair of the White Worm (1911).[20]  He published his Personal Reminiscences of Henry Irving in 1906, after Irving\\'s death, which proved successful,[7] and managed productions at the Prince of Wales Theatre.\\nBefore writing Dracula, Stoker met Ármin Vámbéry, a Hungarian-Jewish writer and traveller (born in Szent-György, Kingdom of Hungary  now Svätý Jur, Slovakia). Dracula likely emerged from Vámbéry\\'s dark stories of the Carpathian mountains.[21] However this claim has been challenged by many including Elizabeth Miller, a professor who, since 1990, has had as her major field of research and writing Dracula, and its author, sources, and influences. She has stated, “The only comment about the subject matter of the talk was that Vambery \\'spoke loudly against Russian aggression.\\'\" There had been nothing in their conversations about the \"tales of the terrible Dracula\" that are supposed to have \"inspired Stoker to equate his vampire-protagonist with the long-dead tyrant.\" At any rate, by this time, Stoker\\'s novel was well underway, and he was already using the name Dracula for his vampire.[22] Stoker then spent several years researching Central and East European folklore and mythological stories of vampires.\\nThe 1972 book In Search of Dracula by Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally claimed that the Count in Stoker\\'s novel was based on Vlad III Dracula.[23] However, according to Elizabeth Miller, Stoker borrowed only the name and \"scraps of miscellaneous information\" about Romanian history; further, there are no comments about Vlad III in the author\\'s working notes.[24][25][26]\\nDracula is an epistolary novel, written as a collection of realistic but completely fictional diary entries, telegrams, letters, ship\\'s logs, and newspaper clippings, all of which added a level of detailed realism to the story, a skill which Stoker had developed as a newspaper writer. At the time of its publication, Dracula was considered a \"straightforward horror novel\" based on imaginary creations of supernatural life.[20] \"It gave form to a universal fantasy ... and became a part of popular culture.\"[20]\\nAccording to the Encyclopedia of World Biography, Stoker\\'s stories are today included in the categories of horror fiction, romanticized Gothic stories, and melodrama.[20] They are classified alongside other works of popular fiction, such as Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein, which also used the myth-making and story-telling method of having multiple narrators telling the same tale from different perspectives. According to historian Jules Zanger, this leads the reader to the assumption that \"they can\\'t all be lying\".[27]\\nThe original 541-page typescript of Dracula was believed to have been lost until it was found in a barn in northwestern Pennsylvania in the early 1980s.[28] It consisted of typed sheets with many emendations, and handwritten on the title page was \"THE UN-DEAD.\" The author\\'s name was shown at the bottom as Bram Stoker. Author Robert Latham remarked: \"the most famous horror novel ever published, its title changed at the last minute.\"[29] The typescript was purchased by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.\\nStoker\\'s inspirations for the story, in addition to Whitby, may have included a visit to Slains Castle in Aberdeenshire, a visit to the crypts of St. Michan\\'s Church in Dublin, and the novella Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu.[30]\\nStoker\\'s original research notes for the novel are kept by the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia. A facsimile edition of the notes was created by Elizabeth Miller and Robert Eighteen-Bisang in 1998.\\nStoker was a member of The London Library and conducted much of the research for Dracula there.[31] In 2018, the Library discovered some of the books that Stoker used for his research, complete with notes and marginalia.[32]\\nAfter suffering a number of strokes, Stoker died at No. 26 St George\\'s Square, London on 20 April 1912.[33] Some biographers attribute the cause of death to overwork,[34] others to tertiary syphilis.[35] His death certificate listed the cause of death as \"Locomotor ataxia 6 months\", presumed to be a reference to syphilis.[36][37] He was cremated, and his ashes were placed in a display urn at Golders Green Crematorium in north London. The ashes of Irving Noel Stoker, the author\\'s son, were added to his father\\'s urn following his death in 1961. The original plan had been to keep his parents\\' ashes together, but after Florence Stoker\\'s death, her ashes were scattered at the Gardens of Rest.\\nStoker was raised a Protestant in the Church of Ireland. He was a strong supporter of the Liberal Party and took a keen interest in Irish affairs.[7] As a \"philosophical home ruler\", he supported Home Rule for Ireland brought about by peaceful means. He remained an ardent monarchist who believed that Ireland should remain within the British Empire, an entity that he saw as a force for good. He was an admirer of Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, whom he knew personally, and supported his plans for Ireland.[38]\\nStoker believed in progress and took a keen interest in science and science-based medicine. Some of Stoker\\'s novels represent early examples of science fiction, such as The Lady of the Shroud (1909). He had a writer\\'s interest in the occult, notably mesmerism, but despised fraud and believed in the superiority of the scientific method over superstition. Stoker counted among his friends J. W. Brodie-Innis, a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and hired member Pamela Colman Smith as an artist for the Lyceum Theatre, but no evidence suggests that Stoker ever joined the Order himself.[39][40][41] Although Irving was an active Freemason, no evidence has been found of Stoker taking part in Masonic activities in London.[42] The Grand Lodge of Ireland also has no record of his membership.[43]\\nThe short story collection Dracula\\'s Guest and Other Weird Stories was published in 1914 by Stoker\\'s widow, Florence Stoker, who was also his literary executrix. The first film adaptation of Dracula was F. W. Murnau\\'s Nosferatu, released in 1922, with Max Schreck starring as Count Orlok. Florence Stoker eventually sued the filmmakers, and was represented by the attorneys of the British Incorporated Society of Authors. Her chief legal complaint was that she had neither been asked for permission for the adaptation nor paid any royalty. The case dragged on for some years, with Mrs. Stoker demanding the destruction of the negative and all prints of the film. The suit was finally resolved in the widow\\'s favour in July 1925. A single print of the film survived, however, and it has become well known. The first authorised film version of Dracula did not come about until almost a decade later when Universal Studios released Tod Browning\\'s Dracula starring Bela Lugosi.\\nCanadian writer Dacre Stoker, a great-grandnephew of Bram Stoker, decided to write \"a sequel that bore the Stoker name\" to \"reestablish creative control over\" the original novel, with encouragement from screenwriter Ian Holt, because of the Stokers\\' frustrating history with Dracula\\'s copyright. In 2009, Dracula: The Un-Dead was released, written by Dacre Stoker and Ian Holt. Both writers \"based [their work] on Bram Stoker\\'s own handwritten notes for characters and plot threads excised from the original edition\" along with their own research for the sequel. This also marked Dacre Stoker\\'s writing debut.[44][45]\\nIn spring 2012, Dacre Stoker (in collaboration with Elizabeth Miller) presented the \"lost\" Dublin Journal written by Bram Stoker, which had been kept by his great-grandson Noel Dobbs. Stoker\\'s diary entries shed a light on the issues that concerned him before his London years. A remark about a boy who caught flies in a bottle might be a clue for the later development of the Renfield character in Dracula.[46]\\nOn 8 November 2012, Stoker was honoured with a Google Doodle on Google\\'s homepage commemorating the 165th anniversary of his birth.[47][48]\\nAn annual festival takes place in Dublin, the birthplace of Bram Stoker, in honour of his literary achievements. The 2014 Bram Stoker Festival encompassed literary, film, family, street, and outdoor events, and ran from October 24 to 27 in Dublin.[49][50] The festival is supported by the Bram Stoker Estate[51] and funded by Dublin City Council and Fáilte Ireland.\\n',\n",

She is an outspoken advocate for the romance genre and has been the recipient of the Susan Koppelman Award for Feminist Studies.\\nJayne Ann Castle was born on March 28, 1948, in Cobb, California, United States.[1] She and her two brothers were raised by their mother, Alberta, in Borrego Springs for the first decade of Jayne\\'s life.\\nShe earned a B.A in History at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1970.[2] Fearful that she would be unable to find a job using her degree, she elected to obtain her graduate degree in Library Science from San Jose State University. Immediately after graduation she married Frank Krentz, an engineer, whom she had met at San Jose State. The couple moved to the Virgin Islands, where Krentz worked for a year as an elementary school librarian, a time she refers to as \"an unmitigated career disaster\".[1] Realizing that she enjoyed being a librarian but not the aspects of teaching that working in an elementary school required, Krentz moved into the higher levels of academia, including a stint in the Duke University library system.[1] Krentz and her husband later moved to Seattle, Washington.\\nKrentz has been generous in sharing her wealth with libraries. She established the Castle Humanities Fund at UCSC\\'s University Library to allow the library to purchase additional books and has given money to 15 Seattle-area elementary schools to enhance their library budgets. She is also a member of the Advisory Board for the Writers Programs at the University of Washington extension program.[2][3]\\nWhile working at Duke, Krentz began writing stories her way, combining elements of romance novels with paranormal twists. For six years she wrote and mailed proposals for new novels, consistently receiving rejection letters.[1] She claims to have tried to stop writing several times during that period, but that it became a \"compulsion\".[3] During this time she and her family moved to Seattle, Washington to further her husband\\'s aerospace career.\\nKrentz continued writing, and, in 1979, she sold her first novel, Gentle Pirate.[1] That novel and several that followed were published within various category romance lines, as that was the only method in which contemporary romance was published. As more publishers began to release single-title contemporary romances, Krentz shifted into writing only single-title novels.[4]\\nHer first novels were released under her birth name, Jayne Castle. Krentz signed a contract allowing one of her publishers to own the name, and, after leaving that publisher, Krentz was unable to use that name on new works for ten years. This led to the creation of several pseudonyms, including Jayne Taylor, Jayne Bentley, Stephanie James and Amanda Glass. By the mid-1980s she had begun using only her married name, Jayne Ann Krentz, for all of her contemporary romance novels.[1]\\nHer 1986 novel, Sweet Starfire, was a futuristic romance, a subgenre that combined elements of romance novels and science fiction. The novel was a \"classic road trip romance\" which just happened to be set in a separate galaxy. In 1987 she published a second futuristic romance, Crystal Flame, which again allowed for a \"traditional romance plot unfold[ing] in an extraordinary world\".[5]\\nThe success of these books encouraged Krentz to try to write a real historical romance with a humorous twist, which she released under the pseudonym Amanda Quick.[5]\\nShe began writing paranormal futuristic novels of romantic suspense in 1996. Released under her maiden name, Jayne Castle, these novels are set far in the future in a world where everyone has a psychic talent and respectable people use marriage agencies instead of choosing their own mates. As is customary in her writing, in each case the protagonists have a mystery to solve or a villain to defeat.[6]\\nPsychic themes appear throughout Krentz\\'s work. In 2006 she began a new series, called The Arcane Society, which includes books written as Amanda Quick (historical setting), Jayne Ann Krentz (contemporary setting), and Jayne Castle (futuristic setting). The books tell the stories of members of the Arcane Society for the psychically gifted, and each hero and heroine has his or her own psychic power. The books feature a mystery for the protagonists to solve while they are learning to deal with their psychic abilities.[7] The heroes of her novels are always alpha males who are as strong and determined as her heroines.[8]\\nMore than 120 of Krentz\\'s romance novels have been published, with 32 placing on the New York Times Bestseller List. In total, there are over 23 million copies of her books in print.[3]\\nKrentz\\'s novel The Waiting Game was adapted for the Harlequin Romance Series teleplay in 2001.\\nHer books have won many awards. Krentz has been nominated 22 times for Romantic Times Reviewers\\' Choice Awards, winning in 1995 for Trust Me and in 2004 for Falling Awake.[9] She has also received a Romantic Times Career Achievement Award.[9]\\nAn outspoken advocate of the merits of romantic fiction, Krentz maintains that \"[p]opular fiction encapsulates and reinforces many of our most fundamental cultural values. Romance is among the most enduring because it addresses the values of family and human emotional bonds.\" To help educate the public about the genre she became the editor of and a contributor to Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women: Romance Writers on the Appeal of the Romance, a non-fiction essay collection that won the prestigious Susan Koppelman Award for Feminist Studies.[3] Krentz was the inspiration for, and first recipient of, the Romantic Times Jane Austen Award, created to \"honor those in the romance community who have significantly impacted our genre\".[10]\\n',\n",

She was listed in the 1994 Guinness World Records as having sold the most books written in Spanish, and earlier in 1962 UNESCO declared her the most read Spanish writer after Miguel de Cervantes.\\nHer novels were different from other contemporary Western European romantic writers' works because she usually set them in the present and didn't use eroticism, due to the Spanish regime's strict censorship.[1] Her style was direct and her characters were simply presented. These novels have inspired several telenovelas.[2]\\nMaría del Socorro Tellado López was born in the small village of Viavélez, and she was the only girl of five siblings. Her mother was a housewife and her father was a naval mechanic in the Merchant Navy.\\nIn 1939, after the Spanish Civil War, her father was promoted to First Officer and the whole family moved to Cádiz.

She continued to write for and to be published by Editorial Cies and Editorial Bruguera; she also started to study psychology, but did not finish her studies because Editorial Bruguera contracted her to write one short novel every week. In 1948 she went back to Asturias with her mother, where she started publishing a different short novella every two weeks in Latin American magazine Vanidades. She claimed that she was able to write a short novel in two days.\\nShe married Domingo Egusquizaga Sangroniz in 1959 in Covadonga and one year later she gave birth to her first child, her daughter Begoña Egusquizaga Tellado; in 1961 she gave birth to her second child, her son Domingo Egusquizaga Tellado. In 1962, the couple separated, but never divorced.\\nIn 1962 UNESCO declared her the most read Spanish writer after Miguel de Cervantes, and Editorial Bruguera offered her an exclusive contract to write. She would later have problems with Editorial Bruguera, because they republished some of her novels under a different title without her permission. She started to write for Editorial Rollán, but in 1973 Editorial Bruguera filed a lawsuit against her and won, and she had to pay them compensation, in addition to returning to work for them. Her last  works for Editorial Buguera were erotic novels under the pen name of Ada Leswy or Ada Miller Leswy.\\nShe also published some children's books in collaboration with Jesús Zantón Santiago, and her favorite novel was Lucha oculta (1991), her first long work.\\nCorín Tellado was listed in the 1994 Guinness World Records as having sold the most books written in Spanish.\\nShe died on 11 April 2009 in her home as a result of a stroke.

She was also originally hired to write the third Indiana Jones movie, finishing a draft for what would be a \"haunted mansion movie\" before the decision was made to make a different movie.[1][2]\\nThomas was born January 7, 1946, in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. Her family moved to Long Beach, California, when she was 12 years old. She attended the University of Southern California and majored in business. Then she worked as an advertising copywriter, wrote travel brochures, took acting classes, and worked toward a degree in psychology.\\nIn 1978, while working on Romancing the Stone, Thomas was a waitress at Coral Beach Cantina on the Pacific Coast Highway.[3]\\nIt took less than a week for her agent, Norman Kurland, to sell the script.[3] Kurland had sent it to several major studios. Actor/producer Michael Douglas and Columbia Pictures bought the script, though the film would later be made by 20th Century Fox.[3]\\nAccording to other accounts, the sale of the screenplay was a Cinderella story in itself: Thomas pitched the story directly to Douglas when the actor happened to come into her cafe as a customer.[4] This account, however, is disputed.[5]\\n\"It just had a spontaneity about the writing,\" Douglas said of the screenplay that would launch Thomas\\' career. \"She was not cautious. The script had a wonderful spirit about it. ... There was a total lack of fear to the writing. It worked.\"[3] The screenplay for Romancing the Stone sold for $250,000.[3]\\nAfter Romancing the Stone, Thomas wrote another screenplay titled either Blonde Hurricane[5] or Blond Hurricane,[4] an adaptation of P. Howard\\'s book of the same name.\\nThomas\\' death came six weeks before the sequel to Romancing the Stone, The Jewel of the Nile, was released. At the time, Thomas was busy writing for the movie Always (1989) for Steven Spielberg and was not available to write The Jewel of the Nile (for which she received a \"Based on characters created by\" credit).[4]\\nAt the time of her death, she was also working on a script for the third Indiana Jones film, reportedly set in a haunted mansion. Steven Spielberg, however, was apparently resistant to the haunted mansion approach, feeling it too closely resembled his earlier film Poltergeist.[1] Thomas had completed the first draft.[4][2]\\nOn October 21, 1985, Thomas, her boyfriend, and another friend attended classes at Pepperdine University and had stopped for drinks on the way home. Because her boyfriend had the least to drink, he told police, he was driving the group in Thomas\\' Porsche Carrera when the car, traveling about 80 miles per hour, spun around on the rain-slick Pacific Coast Highway and struck a telephone pole just south of Coastline Drive near Topanga, California.[3] Thomas, a backseat passenger, was killed instantly. The other friend, 40-year-old Ian Young, was taken to UCLA Medical Center, where he died from his injuries two hours later. Thomas\\' boyfriend was hospitalized with internal injuries and \"was arrested for investigation of driving under the influence of alcohol,\"[3] though no further legal action about the matter was reported.\\nFollowing her death, the UCLA Extension Writers\\' Program created the Diane Thomas Screenwriting Awards in her honor.[4]  Original judges included Steven Spielberg, Michael Douglas, James Brooks, and Kathleen Kennedy.[citation needed] One such winner of this award is Randi Mayem Singer who later went on to write Mrs. Doubtfire.\\n',\n",

       " 'Kay Thorpe (born 1935) is a British author of more than 75 romance novels. She published her novels in Mills & Boon since 1968. All her novels have also been published under Harlequin Enterprises Limited. Over a period of four decades, she has produced a body of sensuous work that investigates heritage, family, class and love. Her forte is to encode the opposing reading within the classic Harlequin plot. A synopsis of the author that accompanies her publications notes that she researched the market for romance fiction before electing to write in this category. Her first book published in North America established her reputation as a gifted storyteller. She has a strong vital writing style.\\nAs her career graph began in the late 1960s, Kay Thorpe, along with Charlotte Lamb and others, was one of the first writers to explore the boundaries of sexual desire, her novels often reflecting the forefront of the \"sexual revolution\" of the 1970s. As such she was also one of the first to create a modern romantic heroine: independent, imperfect, and perfectly capable of initiating a sexual or romantic relationship. However, under Kay Thorpe\\'s expert analysis, the modern romantic heroine had to re-evaluate her age-old perceptions of what constituted love and marriage: she had to accept love unconditionally without looking for security in marriage.\\nKay Thorpe was born in 1935 in England. After leaving school, she tried a variety of jobs, including dental nursing and a spell in the Women\\'s Royal Air Force.\\nIn 1960, Kay was married to Tony, and five years later they had a son John. Now, she and her husband live on the outskirts of Chesterfield in Derbyshire.\\nHer very first completed manuscript accepted, The Last of the Mallorys, was published in 1968. Since then she has written over 70 books.\\nSometimes Kay Thorpe finds she has become two different people: the writer at her happiest when involved in the world of books and authors; and the housewife, turning her hands to the everyday needs of husband and son. Once in a while, she finds it difficult to step from one role to the other. She likes cooking, for instance, but she finds that it can be an irritating interruption when she\\'s preoccupied with work on a novel, so the quality of her efforts in the kitchen tend to be a little erratic. She says, \"As my husband once remarked, my writing gives life a fascinating element of uncertainty: one day a perfect coq au vin, the next day a couple of burned chops!\"\\nLuckily Kay has daily professional help with her housework, and that leaves her time to indulge in her hobbies. Like many other Harlequin authors, she admits to being a voracious consumer of books, a quality she shares with her readers. She likes music and horseback riding, which she does in the countryside near her home. But her favorite hobby is travel - especially to places that will make good settings for her books.\\nKay Thorpe\\'s stories are rich in details covering a diverse background.\\nUnlike Flora Kidd and Robyn Donald, who showcase Scotland and New Zealand in their stories, Kay Thorpe gives her readers a taste for a myriad of locations. By and large, her stories are based on three locations, namely England, Canada and Africa. There are also stories based in Spain, Italy, South America, Greek Islands, Caribbean Islands, South Pacific Islands and Australia.\\nHer main characters always stand by their British heritage. As a result, stories set outside England have an underlying subplot that explore how a newcomer from Britain can come to accept making a home for herself with one of the long-time British descendants settled in Canada or South Africa. For example, Safari South (1976), Timber Boss (1978) and Copper Lake (1981).\\nIn Storm Passage (1977) and Time out of Mind (1987), there is mention of how islands in the South Pacific and in the Caribbean came to be under private ownership by a British descendant.\\nIn Timber Boss (1978), there are references as to how Scottish settlers made the Canadian region of Nova Scotia their new home.\\nKeith in Safari South (1976) appreciates the expansiveness of South Africa and the promising future the country offers him. While Keir in Temporary Marriage (1981) founds his fortunes as an engineering whiz in Sydney, Australia halfway around the world from his native English village.\\nBritish engineers working in remote locations of hot and steamy Sierra Leone, the deserts of Libya, or the outback of Tanzania make up the scenery for The Iron Man (1974), The Man from Tripoli (1979), and No Passing Fancy (1980).\\nIn The Man at Kambala (1973) readers experience Masai Mara Reserve in Kenya. In Safari South (1976), they are taken to the Kruger National Park.\\nThe class division in British society provides the conflict for the love affair in Temporary Marriage (1981). Mention of public vs private schools, manner born, Irish vs English blood, cockney vs upper-class accents that indicate subtleties in class background make their way into her stories from the very first The Last of the Mallorys (1968) to other stories down the years such as No Passing Fancy (1980), A Man of Means (1983), and Win or Lose (1986).\\nAfter man-woman relation, father-daughter and brother-sister relations take second place in many of her stories. While The Man at Kambala (1973) and No Passing Fancy (1980) have affectionate fathers indulging their daughters, the fathers in A Man of Means (1983) and The Land of the Incas (1983) prove self-serving.\\nIn Safari South (1976), Keith and Karen rekindle their sibling affections after years of being apart. While in Opportune Marriage (1969), the young woman realizes with a pang that her even younger brother is coming into his own and doesn\\'t need her as before.\\nAs Lisa looks ahead to her stay in the family home as Kyle\\'s wife in Time Out of Mind (1987), she considers the difficult personality of Kyle\\'s mother as well as his brother. Kyle reassures Lisa that both mother and son can find alternative residences to stay. But Kyle\\'s sentiment shifts in favor of his sister, which prompts him to mock Lisa, \"Will Madalyn be a problem?\".\\nKay Thorpe also takes a stab at the role of the mother, especially when mothers are relatively young compared to their daughters. In Never Trust a Stranger (1983) a forty-something lead actress Emily worries that casting her daughter Gemma in the same Broadway production with herself may bring out the advances in her age. The mother-daughter relationship becomes more poignant when Gemma accuses Logan of being a past lover of her mother. Although Logan denies the charge, there is no denying that the mother in Floodtide (1981) solicits sex from her son-in-law, which he declines albeit politely giving her the benefit of the doubt as needing for herself a full-blooded affair. Somewhere in her books Kay Thorpe throws in that British men think nothing much of their middle-aged wives, who still yearn for the love and romance of their not so far away youth.\\nIn The Iron Man (1974), Dave says that all wives are kept women. Dave\\'s statement notwithstanding, Kay brings to life predatory women who elect to live off men. In This Side of Paradise (1979), Marie travels to a Caribbean resort with the purpose of securing for herself a moneyed man. In Bitter Alliance (1978) and in Never Trust a Stranger (1983), there are women who marry for money. Nonetheless, these women, promiscuous as their case is, are strong individuals who play by their own rules. A charismatic Ailsa in Full Circle (1978), knowing that her looks will not support her in the long run, has a Swiss bank account to fall back on for her olden days.\\nNeil Davids, in This Side of Paradise (1979), says that there are women and there are women, some you use and some you cherish. If Kay showcases two types of women, one who is trading in security for love, and the other who is trading in love for money, she also brings about two competing urges in men, one who is looking for a life partner, and the other who is ready to walk away from a woman without a backward glance. As Liam in Bitter Alliance (1978), and Cal in Wilderness Trail (1978) grapple with movements in their own lives that test them with these two faces of women, Logan in Never Trust a Stranger (1983) must decide if marriage is meant for him. Although the romance series is designed to win the hearts of women, it is up to Kay\\'s heroines to convince and to win over the hearts of these men so to propel them to make a choice in their favor.\\nTheater is a backdrop Kay Thorpe takes up in several of her novels over ensuing decades. For example, Devon Interlude (1968), Curtain Call (1971), Never Trust a Stranger (1983) and The Land of Illusion (1988). In Never Trust a Stranger (1983), it is Logan\\'s use of the word role that clues in would-be actress Gemma to who he is, a theater producer.\\nIn Full Circle (1978), Sara, in an unsteady galley kitchen, dishes out a savory coq au vin albeit with too much wine, which still draws Steve\\'s complement. This story along with others such as Not Wanted on Voyage (1972), and Storm Passage (1977) opens a window to life aboard oceangoing watercraft, be it in a ketch powered by sails or in an ice-breaking whaling ship.\\nShe also uses the sport of horse show jumping in Rising Star (1969), the circus world in Sawdust Season (1972), Corporate takeover in Dividing Line (1979), the international game of snooker in Win or Lose (1986), professional writing in This Side of Paradise (1979) and Skin Deep (1989), professional sculpting in Floodtide (1981), restoration of historical homes in Opportune Marriage (1969).\\nInterwoven in the love stories, there are these varied interests shared by the main protagonists that lend a richness to the quality of the plots and educate the readers no less.\\nKay Thorpe explores many factors contributing to successful male-female intimate relationship, love and finally marriage and her writer\\'s voice comes across strongly in each of her novels.\\nHer narratives give the hero many advantages over the heroine, a trait found in stories of other renowned series novelists such as Flora Kidd, Charlotte Lamb, Robyn Donald just to name a few. However, the harlequin readers anticipate resistance from their heroine until the man confesses his undying love for her. An emotionally secured heroine can, in turn, confess her love for the man.\\nKay Thorpe\\'s women, on the other hand, confess their love to men without first securing for themselves any safety net, emotional or otherwise. In such one-sided confessions, the women commit to staying with these men, willing to pay any price and to go with them just anywhere. For example, The Iron Man (1974), Bitter Alliance (1978), and Temporary Marriage (1981).\\nIn Olive Island (1972) Nikos Alexandros explains to Nickey that she will never be happy if the man does not dominate her. Nickey comes back smartly saying that British women are not as accommodating as Greek women. Jaime in Bitter Alliance (1978), on the other hand, admits to the dominant streak in Liam. But in the wake of her first admission comes a second one that Liam would love her like no other man can. This admission does not readily surface in Kay\\'s other heroines. Therefore, the primary struggle is to fight against it. Ramon observes in Apple in Eden (1973) that a woman constantly baits the man, riling him on purpose; this is all but an attempt to meet up with her match in a man, who then wins her submission.\\nIn Safari South (1976), Brad is let down by Karen\\'s answer to the question of compatibility between a man and a woman. Karen believes that she has to like what he likes and he has to like what she does. Brad counters that by saying what about personal likings and individual freedom? In This Side of Paradise (1979), Ryan responds to the same query by saying if two people are of the same mind, then one becomes superfluous, Gina\\'s tentative answer to which is that one can agree to disagree.\\nMen, as sexual drivers, are the quickest to recognize the significance of sexual compatibility so to use it like a mantra over and over in Kay Thorpe\\'s stories that as long as the couple is sexually compatible it is a foundation from which they can build on. For example, in The Man From Tripoli (1979), Bryn expresses this sentiment to bolster up a simple marriage of convenience.\\nHence, the consensus that Kay establishes across her stories is that without sexual compatibility, there is no man-woman association to begin with. However, Steve in Full Circle (1978) tells Sara that a man can have sex with a woman with no strings attached. Therefore, for such an association to mature into any kind of relationship, women have to realize their own sexual potential to the fullest. Cynicism notwithstanding, Nick in Storm Passage (1977) tells Tara that it is not enough that she makes herself available but that she needs to be all woman in order to let their sexual chemistry work for the benefit of their marriage.\\nAs in the matching libido found between Jaime and Liam in Bitter Alliance (1978), when men find their own libido matching with that of the women, only then the relationship promises to be a lasting one. An older Annette in Sawdust Season (1972) tells young Toni that men are not the marrying type; that they only choose to do so when they find a woman whom they can\\'t get out of their skin.\\nTowards this end, Ross in Dividing Line (1979) tells Kerry that what she perceives as love is mostly made up of sexual attraction. Ross would not be appealing to Kerry if he couldn\\'t arouse her sexually. While Dave in Win or Lose (1986) tells Sara that she is there with him to get laid, Dave in Iron Man (1974) accuses Kim of not confusing that kind of feeling with love.  This reciprocal exchange of sexual needs places both men and women on an equal plane.\\nHowever, Steve in Full Circle (1978) also tells Sara that a vast majority of women cannot have sex with men without being emotionally attached. This perception is not always forthcoming in all of Kay\\'s male protagonists. And so, Kim in Iron Man (1974) rebuts Dave\\'s accusation with her reply that wanting is part of loving for her kind of women.\\nA drawback to women as emotional drivers is when they focus on security so that love becomes just another mean to this basic end. That men take an exception to this is clear from Ross in Dividing Line (1979), who confirms to Kerry that the latter wants to hold off sex until she has a ring on her finger and their signature on a paper.\\nSince men can compartmentalize sexual love and respond to women who most match their libido and women hedge their sexual response to men over emotional attachment and security, the two sexes arrive at cross purposes with each other. In Storm Passage (1977), Nick voices just such a frustration to Tara who he says doesn\\'t even recognize this difference.\\nA lack of understanding of the divergent currents driving men and women easily transpire into mistrust so much so that in The Man from Tripoli (1979), despite the security blanket provided by her marriage, Lisa elects to leave Bryn because, without marital fidelity, she finds sexual love unconvincing. Sexual jealousy, albeit of her own sister, sows mistrust in Lyn\\'s relationship with Andreas in Dangerous Moonlight (1985).\\nIn Curtain Call (1971), Ryan tells Kerry that for men a career would suffice whereas women want a home and a family. Therefore, Kay\\'s men don\\'t see the point in marriage unless it lasts. While proposing marriage to Gemma in Never Trust a Stranger (1983), Logan wants to convince himself that he can stay in it indefinitely and as such can\\'t help but talk only about himself: Gemma doesn\\'t bore him, she doesn\\'t fill the place with clutter, to which Gemma secretly smiles thinking to herself that just give her time.\\nThe married men in Kay\\'s stories show steadfastness in their commitment and no amount of ambivalence from their wives can shake them out of the will to make the marriage work. For example, in Remember This Stranger (1973), the wife, suffering from amnesia, refuses to accept the man as her husband despite all evidence pointing to this fact. The man, suffering from rejection, refuses to give up on her.\\nHowever, keeping with the assertion made in Full Circle (1978) that a man\\'s spontaneous attraction to a woman does not come with strings attached, Bryn, in The Man from Tripoli (1979), doesn\\'t apologise to Lisa for flirting with other women. And Dave, in The Iron Man (1974), answers Kim\\'s question of marital infidelity with a question of his own that if another woman takes undue interest in him, then what is she doing about it? Kay weaves this complexity into the couple\\'s relationship to counter the paranoia she finds in women of jumping to suspect their partners of infidelity.\\nIn an opposite situation when Brad in Opportune Marriage (1969) suspects Lisa of infidelity, he confronts her directly but his emotions go flat when he asks whether she is in love. This is in keeping with another assertion made in Full Circle (1978) that vast majority of women cannot commit to a sexual relationship without some emotional attachment. In Full Circle (1978), the couple\\'s marriage falls apart when Steve is unable to tolerate Sara\\'s infidelity on the basis that sex aside, she must have been emotionally attached to the other man.\\nLisa in Opportune Marriage (1969) acknowledges that she was emotionally unfaithful to her husband if not sexually. She went to this other man for friendship that meant gentleness, tenderness and kindness, which for her construed an emotional cocoon. As Brad in Opportune Marriage (1969) says for everything that he was not. While Brad realizes what was lacking in him, Sara convinces Steve in Full Circle (1978) that her past indiscretion was an attempt at stark revenge for which she had no emotional attachment and that she reserved her deep love for him only.\\nHaving established a marital relationship on the basis of sexual compatibility and fidelity, the couple\\'s personal knowledge of each other\\'s virtues and vices come only with time. Soon after their marriage In Dangerous Moonlight (1985), Andreas asks Lyn that she doesn\\'t really know him, does she? Although she is mortified by this discovery, he is unperturbed. Lyn finally realizes that she has all the years ahead of her to find out the answer to his query.\\nTo Sara\\'s assertion in Full Circle (1978) that men are at their most vulnerable in the aftermath of sexual intercourse, a more experienced Ailsa tells her that men even then know what make them tick. It is In No Passing Fancy (1980) that a father advises his daughter, who demands more alone-time with her husband, saying that a man\\'s career is his pride, and so not to get him away from it. A failure in career constitutes actual vulnerability in men.\\nIn Full Circle (1978), we learn that when a man is sick, depressed, or faces a setback in his career, is also when the woman can penetrate into his ego. And more than anyone else, a woman in the role of his wife, who knows the man from the inside, has the upper hand to witness him at his most vulnerable and then use the knowledge to her advantage.\\nKay charts the progress of desire, from curiosity to intimacy, and then writes about how sexual chemistry can blossom into tenderness, which she reveals in Floodtide (1981) is love.\\nAlthough Kay makes her heroines accept love for its own sake as an unconditional emotion, the result is not humiliation but empowerment as the men reciprocate with sensitivity and depth. Here, Kay appreciates the fact that emotive words don\\'t come easily to most men. Therefore, in Timber Boss (1978), and in Bitter Alliance (1978) after women have made their confessions of love, men contribute to it with cryptic but pregnant remarks such as there is no going back and don\\'t say any more to seal their relationship.\\nAs strong-willed women submit to even stronger willed men, happiness follows.\\nTemporary Marriage (1981) is a Kay Thorpe classic. Regan and Keir are such meaningful names where the name Regan, stands out with pride like its namesake and Keir, an outlandish name suits someone who does something outlandish, coveting a girl beyond his social periphery and then turning hurt pride into zeal and determination.\\nRegan and Keir\\'s story does not finish with the first curtain close. They come together in a second act. But the ghost of the first one lies between them. To exorcise this ghost, they both act on impulses reaching impromptu decisions that voice deeply held sentiments, which they push out at the time from any detailed analysis.\\nThe pretext of marriage gives them the form needed to communicate at a level other than the one using clinical words. This is sexual love where unalloyed emotions bring out the affirmatives which are intellectually negated. And so this form of love opens up a window to their Will.\\nAnd what comes by way of a rescue: a sudden crystallization of emotions. The pent up emotions wandering in the recesses and henceforth stamped out by reasonable means find a sudden release. In an outburst of emotions, the accompanying words flow in a torrent. However, the delivery is still negative in charge. But the negativity is so shrill and brittle in texture, that this time a true listener could hear the affirmation even when the words deny it.\\nAnd so, it is for the listener to validate the affirmative sentiment behind the negative words. A true listener, then, is one who shares in the deep sentiment. This is a test for the listener as well, since if he/she didn\\'t share, then the words would ring out empty and full of negative discord, and not resonate with affirming emotions.\\nFor both the speaker and the listener, there is selfishness in this emotion.\\nThe Man at Kambala (1973), The Iron Man (1974) and Sugar Cane Harvest (1975) also use this motif as the story\\'s climax point.\\n',\n",

       " 'Pamela Wallace (born 1949 in Exeter, California) is an American screenwriter and author. She won an Oscar for co-writing the screenplay for the movie Witness. Wallace has also written 25 romance novels, under her own name and the pseudonyms Pamela Simpson and Dianne King.\\nThe original script for Witness was conceived by Pamela Wallace in the 1970s and was inspired by an episode of the western drama series Gunsmoke. The idea was turned into a screenplay by her husband Earl W. Wallace and his colleague William Kelley in 1983.[1][2] The script was rejected multiple times but was finally purchased by producer Edward S. Feldman. The resulting film, Witness, was released in 1985 and starred Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis. The following year, Wallace received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay along with William Kelley and Earl W. Wallace for Witness.[3]  The script also won awards from the Mystery Writers of America and the Writers Guild of America.[4] The Writers Guild later named Witness to their list of the Top 101 Greatest Scripts.[5]\\nIn the late 1980s, Wallace collaborated with fellow screenwriter Madeline DiMaggio on a screenplay they called If The Shoe Fits. This was made into a low-budget movie that barely resembled their script. Wallace was given the opportunity to remove her name from the movie credits, but she chose to keep the credit for her resume despite her dislike of the movie.[6]\\nBy the late 1990s, Wallace was once again writing successful screenplays. She wrote the first segment of the award-winning 1996 HBO movie, If These Walls Could Talk.[7] The following year, Borrowed Hearts became one of the highest-rated CBS movies.[4]\\nWallace also adapted one of her own novels, Straight From the Heart into a screenplay for Hallmark Channel. The resulting movie became the highest-rated film for the network in 2003.[4] She also penned the screenplay for the 2006 Hallmark Channel movie Though None Go with Me, starring Cheryl Ladd. She has written several other Hallmark Channel and Lifetime Network movies.\\nWallace has written 25 romance novels.[4] These have been published under her own name, as well as the pseudonyms Dianne King and Pamela Simpson.[8] An additional pen name, Pamela Simpson, came about through a collaboration with Carla Simpson, who had previously written eleven historical romance novels under the pseudonym Quinn Taylor Evans. In the early 1990s the pair completed three contemporary romantic suspense novels. The novels were translated into seven languages. Two of them, Fortune\\'s Child and Partners in Time, were optioned for film.[9]\\nIn 2000, Wallace wrote a nonfiction book called You Can Write a Screenplay. Drawing on her own experiences in Hollywood, the book walked readers through the entire screenwriting process, beginning with the initial idea. It provided tips for writing the screenplay, as well as advice on how to sell the completed work.[3]\\nShe has served as an executive producer for the cable television series \"Beyond the Break\",[5] as well as for the television movies Last Chance Cafe and A Very Merry Daughter of the Bride.\\n',\n",

       " 'Professor Maggie Walsh is a fictional character in the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The character is portrayed by Lindsay Crouse.\\nProfessor Maggie Walsh is introduced in Season Four, as Buffy\\'s Psychology professor at the University of California, Sunnydale, but is later revealed as the leader of the government-controlled Initiative, a military project intent on capturing, studying, and modifying the behavior of various demons. Unknown to many in the Initiative, Walsh is also involved in Project 314, a secret program within the Initiative that is creating a hybrid demon-humanoid-mechanoid (demonoid) known as Adam. Various creatures captured by the Initiative were dissected to provide the parts for Adam.\\nMaggie maintains a close relationship with Riley, who is her favorite soldier; she appears to think of him as a son. After Riley learns that Buffy is the Slayer, they inform Walsh of her role. Walsh initially thinks that Buffy can be a useful ally to the Initiative, but soon takes a dislike to her unpredictability and unwelcome curiosity, especially with regards to the \"314 Project\". Cameras installed in Riley\\'s room allow her to spy on Buffy and Riley while they have sex, and later to hear Buffy ask Riley about the 314 Project. Perceiving that Buffy poses a risk to the project, Walsh tries to kill Buffy by sending her on a mission on which she is ambushed by two demons released from the Initiative\\'s holding cells. Buffy defeats the demons and appears on the monitors after Walsh has prematurely announced Buffy\\'s death to Riley, who walks out. Walsh retreats to the labs of Project 314, where she plots how to use Adam to defeat Buffy. However, Adam awakens and impales Walsh, killing her, and escapes from the Initiative.\\nWalsh appears in the penultimate episode of Season Four, \"Primeval,\" as a zombie, working under Adam along with others Adam has killed. Attempting to finish off Project 314, begun by Walsh, Adam has his workers manufacturing more creatures like himself; part demon, human, and machine combined. Adam activates the chip Walsh had inserted into Riley\\'s heart, making him biddable to Adam\\'s command. Zombie Walsh attacks Buffy when she comes to Riley\\'s rescue, but Buffy knocks her down and defeats her, and with some help from the Scooby-Gang of Willow, Xander, and Giles, she defeats Adam as well. The Initiative project is shut down permanently.\\nCrouse viewed her character \"no nonsense, and she seems to be a real teacher. She\\'s like a President. She really would like to fashion the world in her image. She\\'s not a mean person, she\\'s just a straight-out scientist.\"[1]\\nIn a gender studies text, Jowett includes a section on the character, and argues the character is \"masculinized by her roles as professor, scientist and leader.\"[2]\\nCrouse has explained how her character was initially explained to her, \"Joss tried to explain to me who this character was. He said that she was a scientist, and that she was going to be doing research and eventually, she might hatch an evil plot, but her front was being a psychology teacher.\"[3]\\nCrouse gave some insight into her view on her character, \"She\\'s such an extremist. She has a vision of what she wants to do. She feels like she\\'s testing the boundaries of something, and any human being always feels important no matter who they are. I\\'m sure she admires Dr. Frankenstein - or Einstein. She\\'s probably a mix of those two. I like her caustic nature, because she\\'s not a mean person. I have always imagined that Maggie treats people like grown-ups. That she doesn\\'t want to live in a world of babies. She doesn\\'t have the time for it. The Initiative is her baby.\"[4]\\nCrouse outlined her view of Maggie\\'s relationships with Riley and Buffy, \"Her teaching assistant Riley is really the child she never had, and there\\'s probably confusion there that he\\'s a potential something for her that\\'s slightly out of her reach, but she\\'s willing to prevent anyone else from being interested in him. I think she feels she\\'s in direct competition with Buffy. The most complicated situation for her is having Riley fall in love with Buffy. Finding out that Buffy is the Slayer is a kind of a gas, and it\\'s nervous-making and exciting to have good people on her team; she\\'s like a president - she wants a great cabinet underneath her. I think she\\'d like to fashion the world in her image, but Buffy puts a wrench in the works\".[5]\\nBuffy writer David Fury said in an interview, \"I don\\'t think Joss had envisioned Maggie Walsh as being entirely villainous. As opposed to just sort of misguided.\"[6]\\n',\n",

For five years, she worked her way up the journalistic ladder, from answering phones to writing to editing.[1][2]  The work taught her the need for brevity and clarity in writing, as well as the fact that an article must grab the reader\\'s attention immediately.[2]\\nReady for a change, Warren moved into corporate communications and public relations.

I imagined myself barefoot with a baby on my hip, raising crops and canning organic vegetables.\"[1]\\nHowever, she soon grew dispirited due to the ill effects of pesticides and the helplessness she experienced because of her inability to \"[...] do anything about it\".[1]\\nFrasier credits these negative feelings, as well as general isolation, as the spark that prompted her to start writing genre fiction. As an unpublished author without college education, she did not know anything about submitting manuscripts.

According to Frasier this had led to a lack of success in finding a publisher for her book, Amazon Lily.[6] According to publishers, her main hero was \"unlikable\" and therefore would not fare well on the market.\\nEven after the success of Amazon Lily, Frasier still was met with hostility from editors and publishers when querying her books.

Wharton drew upon her insider\\'s knowledge of the upper-class New York \"aristocracy\" to portray realistically the lives and morals of the Gilded Age. In 1921, she became the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction, for her novel The Age of Innocence. She was inducted into the National Women\\'s Hall of Fame in 1996.[1] Among her other well known works are The House of Mirth, the novella Ethan Frome, and several notable ghost stories.\\nEdith Wharton was born Edith Newbold Jones on January 24, 1862, to George Frederic Jones and Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander at their brownstone at 14 West Twenty-third Street in New York City.[2][3] To her friends and family she was known as \"Pussy Jones\". [4] She had two elder brothers, Frederic Rhinelander and Henry Edward. [2] Frederic married Mary Cadwalader Rawle; their daughter was landscape architect Beatrix Farrand. Edith was baptized April 20, 1862, Easter Sunday, at Grace Church.[2]\\nWharton\\'s paternal family, the Joneses, were a very wealthy and socially prominent family having made their money in real estate.[5] The saying \"keeping up with the Joneses\" is said to refer to her father\\'s family.[6][7] She was related to the Rensselaers, the most prestigious of the old patroon families, who had received land grants from the former Dutch government of New York and New Jersey. Her father\\'s first cousin was Caroline Schermerhorn Astor.[8] Fort Stevens in New York was named for Wharton\\'s maternal great-grandfather, Ebenezer Stevens, a Revolutionary War hero and general. [9]\\nWharton was born during the Civil War; however, in describing her family life Wharton does not mention the war except that their travels to Europe after the war were due to the depreciation of American currency.[2][10] From 1866 to 1872, the Jones family visited France, Italy, Germany, and Spain.[11] During her travels, the young Edith became fluent in French, German, and Italian. At the age of nine, she suffered from typhoid fever, which nearly killed her, while the family was at a spa in the Black Forest.[2] After the family returned to the United States in 1872, they spent their winters in New York City and their summers in Newport, Rhode Island.[11] While in Europe, she was educated by tutors and governesses. She rejected the standards of fashion and etiquette that were expected of young girls at the time, which were intended to allow women to marry well and to be put on display at balls and parties. She considered these fashions superficial and oppressive. Edith wanted more education than she received, so she read from her father\\'s library and from the libraries of her father\\'s friends.[12] Her mother forbade her to read novels until she was married, and Edith obeyed this command.[13]\\nWharton wrote and told stories from an early age.[14] When her family moved to Europe and she was just four or five she started what she called \"making up.\"[14] She invented stories for her family and walked with an open book, turning the pages as if reading while improvising a story.[14] Wharton began writing poetry and fiction as a young girl, and attempted to write her first novel at the age of 11.[15] Her mother\\'s criticism quashed her ambition and she turned to poetry.[15] She was 15 years old when her first published work appeared, a translation of a German poem \"Was die Steine Erzählen\" (\"What the Stones Tell\") by Heinrich Karl Brugsch, for which she was paid $50. Her family did not want her name to appear in print since writing was not considered a proper occupation for a society woman of her time. Consequently, the poem was published under the name of a friend\\'s father, E. A. Washburn, a cousin of Ralph Waldo Emerson who supported women\\'s education.[16] In 1877, at the age of 15, she secretly wrote a novella, Fast and Loose. In 1878, her father arranged for a collection of two dozen original poems and five translations, Verses, to be privately published.[17] Wharton published a poem under a pseudonym in the New York World in 1879.[18] In 1880, she had five poems published anonymously in the Atlantic Monthly, an important literary magazine.[19] Despite these early successes, she was not encouraged by her family or her social circle, and though she continued to write, she did not publish anything more until her poem \"The Last Giustiniani\" was published in Scribner\\'s Magazine in October 1889.[20]\\nBetween 1880 and 1890, Wharton put her writing aside to participate in the social rituals of the New York upper classes. She keenly observed the social changes happening around her, which she used later in her writing.[21] Wharton officially came out as a debutante to society in 1879.[22] She was allowed to bare her shoulders and wear her hair up for the first time at a December dance given by a Society matron, Anna Morton.[22] Wharton began a courtship with Henry Leyden Stevens, the son of Paran Stevens, a wealthy hotelier and real estate investor from rural New Hampshire. His sister Minnie married Arthur Paget.[23] The Jones family did not approve of Stevens.[23]\\nIn the middle of her debutante season, the Jones family returned to Europe in 1881 for her father\\'s health.[24] In spite of this, her father, George Frederic Jones, died of a stroke in Cannes in 1882.[25] Stevens was with the Jones family in Europe during this time.[24] After returning to the United States with her mother, Wharton continued her courtship with Stevens, announcing their engagement in August 1882.[24] The month the two were to marry, the engagement abruptly ended.[26]\\nWharton\\'s mother, Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander Jones, moved back to Paris in 1883 and lived there until her death in 1901.[10]\\nOn April 29, 1885,[27] at the age of 23, Wharton married Edward Robbins (Teddy) Wharton, who was 12 years her senior, at the Trinity Chapel Complex in Manhattan.[28][29] From a well-established Boston family, he was a sportsman and a gentleman of the same social class and shared her love of travel. The Whartons set up house at Pencraig Cottage in Newport.[30] In 1893, they bought a house named Land\\'s End, on the other side of Newport, for $80,000, and moved into it.[30] Wharton decorated Land\\'s End with the help of designer Ogden Codman. In 1897, the Whartons purchased their New York home, 884 Park Avenue.[31] Between 1886 and 1897, they traveled overseas in the period from February to June – mostly visiting Italy but also Paris and England.[31] From her marriage onwards, three interests came to dominate Wharton\\'s life: American houses, writing, and Italy.[30]\\nFrom the late 1880s until 1902, Teddy Wharton suffered from chronic depression. The couple then ceased their extensive travel.[32] At that time, his depression became more debilitating, after which they lived almost exclusively at their estate The Mount in Lenox, Massachusetts. During those same years, Wharton herself was said to suffer from asthma and periods of depression.[33]\\nIn 1908, Teddy Wharton\\'s mental condition was determined to be incurable. In that year, Wharton began an affair with Morton Fullerton, an author, and foreign correspondent for The Times of London, in whom she found an intellectual partner.[34] She divorced Edward Wharton in 1913, after 28 years of marriage.[32] Around the same time, she was beset with harsh literary criticism from the naturalist school of writers.\\nIn addition to novels, Wharton wrote at least 85 short stories.[12] She was also a garden designer, an interior designer, and a taste-maker of her time. She wrote several design books, including her first major published work, The Decoration of Houses (1897), co-authored by Ogden Codman. Another of her \"home and garden\" books is the generously illustrated Italian Villas and Their Gardens of 1904, illustrated by Maxfield Parrish.\\nOver the course of her life, she crossed the Atlantic 60 times.[35] In Europe, her primary destinations were Italy, France, and England. She also went to Morocco. She wrote many books about her travels, including Italian Backgrounds and A Motor-Flight through France.\\nHer husband Edward Wharton shared her love of travel and for many years they spent at least four months of each year abroad, mainly in Italy. Their friend Egerton Winthrop accompanied them on many journeys there.[36] In 1888, the Whartons and their friend James Van Alen took a cruise through the Aegean islands. Wharton was 26. The trip cost the Whartons $10,000 and lasted four months.[37] She kept a travel journal during this trip that was thought to be lost but was later published as The Cruise of the Vanadis, now considered her earliest known travel writing.[38]\\nIn 1897, Edith Wharton purchased Land\\'s End in Newport, Rhode Island, from Robert Livingston Beeckman, a former U.S. Open Tennis Championship runner-up who became governor of Rhode Island. At the time, Wharton described the main house as \"incurably ugly\". Wharton agreed to pay $80,000 for the property, and spent thousands more to alter the home\\'s facade, decorate the interior, and landscape the grounds.\\nIn 1902, Wharton designed The Mount, her estate in Lenox, Massachusetts, which survives today as an example of her design principles. She wrote several of her novels there, including The House of Mirth (1905), the first of many chronicles of life in old New York. At The Mount, she entertained the cream of American literary society, including her close friend, novelist Henry James, who described the estate as \"a delicate French chateau mirrored in a Massachusetts pond\".[39] Although she spent many months traveling in Europe nearly every year with her friend, Egerton Winthrop (a descendant of John Winthrop), The Mount was her primary residence until 1911.[37] When living there and while traveling abroad, Wharton was usually driven to appointments by her longtime chauffeur and friend Charles Cook, a native of nearby South Lee, Massachusetts.[40][41] When her marriage deteriorated, she decided to move permanently to France, living first at 53 Rue de Varenne, Paris, in an apartment that belonged to George Washington Vanderbilt II.\\nWharton was preparing to vacation for the summer when World War I broke out. Though many fled Paris, she moved back to her Paris apartment on the Rue de Varenne and for four years was a tireless and ardent supporter of the French war effort.[42] One of the first causes she undertook in August 1914 was the opening of a workroom for unemployed women; here they were fed and paid one franc a day. What began with 30 women soon doubled to 60, and their sewing business began to thrive.[43] When the Germans invaded Belgium in the fall of 1914 and Paris was flooded with Belgian refugees, she helped to set up the American Hostels for Refugees, which managed to get them shelter, meals, and clothes, and eventually created an employment agency to help them find work.[44] She collected more than $100,000 on their behalf.[45] In early 1915, she organized the Children of Flanders Rescue Committee, which gave shelter to nearly 900 Belgian refugees who had fled when their homes were bombed by the Germans.[46]\\nAided by her influential connections in the French government, she and her long-time friend Walter Berry (then president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Paris), were among the few foreigners in France allowed to travel to the front lines during World War I. She and Berry made five journeys between February and August 1915, which Wharton described in a series of articles that were first published in Scribner\\'s Magazine and later as Fighting France: From Dunkerque to Belfort, which became an American bestseller.[47][48] Travelling by car, Wharton and Berry drove through the war zone, viewing one decimated French village after another. She visited the trenches, and was within earshot of artillery fire. She wrote, \"We woke to a noise of guns closer and more incessant\\xa0... and when we went out into the streets it seemed as if, overnight, a new army had sprung out of the ground\".[49]\\nThroughout the war, she worked tirelessly in charitable efforts for refugees, the injured, the unemployed, and the displaced. She was a \"heroic worker on behalf of her adopted country\".[50] On April 18, 1916, Raymond Poincaré, the then-President of France appointed her Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, the country\\'s highest award, in recognition of her dedication to the war effort.[45][51] Her relief work included setting up workrooms for unemployed French women, organizing concerts to provide work for musicians, raising tens of thousands of dollars for the war effort, and opening tuberculosis hospitals. In 1915, Wharton edited a charity benefit volume, The Book of the Homeless, which included essays, art, poetry, and musical scores by many major contemporary European and American artists, including Henry James, Joseph Conrad, William Dean Howells, Anna de Noailles, Jean Cocteau, and Walter Gay, among others. Wharton proposed the book to her publisher, Scribner\\'s, handled the business arrangements, lined up contributors, and translated the French entries into English. Theodore Roosevelt wrote a two-page introduction in which he praised Wharton\\'s effort and urged Americans to support the war.[52] She also kept up her own work, continuing to write novels, short stories, and poems, as well as reporting for The New York Times and keeping up her enormous correspondence.[53] Wharton urged Americans to support the war effort and encouraged America to enter the war.[54] She wrote the popular romantic novel Summer in 1916, the war novella The Marne in 1918, and A Son at the Front in 1919 (published 1923). When the war ended, she watched the Victory Parade from the Champs Elysees\\' balcony of a friend\\'s apartment. After four years of intense effort, she decided to leave Paris for the quiet of the countryside. Wharton settled 10\\xa0mi (16\\xa0km) north of Paris in Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt, buying an 18th-century house on seven acres of land that she called Pavillon Colombe. She lived there in summer and autumn for the rest of her life, spending winters and springs on the French Riviera at Sainte Claire du Vieux Chateau in Hyères.[55]\\nWharton was a committed supporter of French imperialism, describing herself as a \"rabid imperialist\", and the war solidified her political views.[56] After the war, she traveled to Morocco as the guest of Resident General Hubert Lyautey and wrote the book In Morocco, full of praise for the French administration, Lyautey, and particularly his wife.\\nDuring the post-war years, she divided her time between Hyères and Provence, where she finished The Age of Innocence in 1920. She returned to the United States only once after the war to receive an honorary doctorate from Yale University in 1923.\\nThe Age of Innocence (1920) won the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction,[57] making Wharton the first woman to win the award. The three fiction judges – literary critic Stuart Pratt Sherman, literature professor Robert Morss Lovett, and novelist Hamlin Garland – voted to give the prize to Sinclair Lewis for his satire Main Street, but Columbia University\\'s advisory board, led by conservative university president Nicholas Murray Butler, overturned their decision and awarded the prize to The Age of Innocence.[58] She was also nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1927, 1928, and 1930.[59]\\nWharton was friend and confidante to many prominent intellectuals of her time: Henry James, Sinclair Lewis, Jean Cocteau, and André Gide were all her guests at one time or another. Theodore Roosevelt, Bernard Berenson, and Kenneth Clark were valued friends as well. Particularly notable was her meeting with F. Scott Fitzgerald, described by the editors of her letters as \"one of the better known failed encounters in the American literary annals\". She spoke fluent French, Italian, and German, and many of her books were published in both French and English.\\n\\nIn 1934, Wharton\\'s autobiography A Backward Glance was published. In the view of Judith E. Funston, writing on Edith Wharton in American National Biography, What is most notable about A Backward Glance, however, is what it does not tell: her criticism of Lucretia Jones [her mother], her difficulties with Teddy, and her affair with Morton Fullerton, which did not come to light until her papers, deposited in Yale\\'s Beinecke Rare Book Room and Manuscript Library, were opened in 1968.[60]On June 1, 1937, Wharton was at her French country home (shared with architect and interior decorator Ogden Codman), where she was at work on a revised edition of The Decoration of Houses, when she suffered a heart attack and collapsed.[61]\\nShe died of a stroke on August 11, 1937, at Le Pavillon Colombe, her 18th-century house on Rue de Montmorency in Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt. She died at 5:30\\xa0p.m., but her death was not known in Paris. At her bedside was her friend, Mrs. Royall Tyler.[62] Wharton was buried in the American Protestant section of the Cimetière des Gonards in Versailles, \"with all the honors owed a war hero and a chevalier of the Legion of Honor ... a group of some one hundred friends sang a verse of the hymn \\'O Paradise\\'...\"[63]\\nDespite not publishing her first novel until she was forty, Wharton became an extraordinarily productive writer. In addition to\\nher 15 novels, seven novellas, and eighty-five short stories, she published poetry, books on design, travel, literary and cultural criticism, and a memoir.[64]\\nIn 1873, Wharton wrote a short story and gave it to her mother to read. Stinging from her mother\\'s critique, Wharton decided to write only poetry. While she constantly sought her mother\\'s approval and love, she rarely received either, and their relationship was a troubled one.[65] Before she was 15, Wharton wrote Fast and Loose (1877). In her youth, she wrote about society. Her central themes came from her experiences with her parents. She was very critical of her work and wrote public reviews criticizing it. She also wrote about her own experiences with life. \"Intense Love\\'s Utterance\" is a poem written about Henry Stevens.[37]\\nIn 1889, she sent out three poems for publication, to Scribner\\'s, Harper\\'s and Century. Edward L. Burlingame published \"The Last Giustiniani\" for Scribner\\'s. It was not until Wharton was 29 that her first short story was published: \"Mrs. Manstey\\'s View\" had very little success, and it took her more than a year to publish another story. She completed \"The Fullness of Life\" following her annual European trip with Teddy. Burlingame was critical of this story but Wharton did not want to make edits to it. This story, along with many others, speaks about her marriage. She sent Bunner Sisters to Scribner\\'s in 1892. Burlingame wrote back that it was too long for Scribner\\'s to publish. This story is believed to be based on an experience she had as a child. It did not see publication until 1916 and is included in the collection called Xingu.\\nAfter a visit with her friend, Paul Bourget, she wrote \"The Good May Come\" and \"The Lamp of Psyche\". \"The Lamp of Psyche\" was a comical story with verbal wit and sorrow. After \"Something Exquisite\" was rejected by Burlingame, she lost confidence in herself. She started travel writing in 1894.[37]\\nIn 1901, Wharton wrote a two-act play called Man of Genius. This play was about an English man who was having an affair with his secretary. The play was rehearsed but was never produced. Another 1901 play, The Shadow of a Doubt, which also came close to being staged but fell through, was thought to be lost, until it was discovered in 2017. Its world premiere was a radio adaptation broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 2018.[66]  She collaborated with Marie Tempest to write another play, but the two only completed four acts before Marie decided she was no longer interested in costume plays. One of her earliest literary endeavors (1902) was the translation of the play Es Lebe das Leben (\"The Joy of Living\"), by Hermann Sudermann. The Joy of Living was criticized for its title because the heroine swallows poison at the end, and was a short-lived Broadway production. It was, however, a successful book.[37]\\nMany of Wharton\\'s novels are characterized by subtle use of dramatic irony. Having grown up in upper-class, late-19th-century society, Wharton became one of its most astute critics, in such works as The House of Mirth and The Age of Innocence.\\nVersions of her mother, Lucretia Jones, often appeared in Wharton\\'s fiction. Biographer Hermione Lee described it as \"one of the most lethal acts of revenge ever taken by a writing daughter.\"[25] In her memoir, A Backward Glance, Wharton describes her mother as indolent, spendthrift, censorious, disapproving, superficial, icy, dry and ironic.[25]\\nWharton\\'s writings often dealt with themes such as \"social and individual fulfillment, repressed sexuality, and the manners of old families and the new elite.\"[67] Maureen Howard, editor of Edith Wharton: Collected Stories, notes several recurring themes in Wharton\\'s short stories, including confinement and attempts at freedom, the morality of the author, critiques of intellectual pretension, and the \"unmasking\" of the truth.[68] Wharton\\'s writing also explored themes of \"social mores and social reform\" as they relate to the \"extremes and anxieties of the Gilded Age\".[67]\\nA key recurring theme in Wharton\\'s writing is the relationship between the house as a physical space and its relationship to its inhabitant\\'s characteristics and emotions. Maureen Howard argues \"Edith Wharton conceived of houses, dwelling places, in extended imagery of shelter and dispossession. Houses – their confinement and their theatrical possibilities ... they are never mere settings.\"[68]\\nAmerican children\\'s stories containing slang were forbidden in Wharton\\'s childhood home.[69] This included such popular authors as Mark Twain, Bret Harte, and Joel Chandler Harris. She was allowed to read Louisa May Alcott but Wharton preferred Lewis Carroll\\'s Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland and Charles Kingsley\\'s The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby.[69] Wharton\\'s mother forbade her from reading many novels and Wharton said she \"read everything else but novels until the day of my marriage.\" [69] Instead Wharton read the classics, philosophy, history, and poetry in her father\\'s library including Daniel Defoe, John Milton, Thomas Carlyle, Alphonse de Lamartine, Victor Hugo, Jean Racine, Thomas Moore, Lord Byron, William Wordsworth, John Ruskin, and Washington Irving.[70] Biographer Hermione Lee describes Wharton as having read herself \"out of Old New York\" and her influences included Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, T. H. Huxley, George Romanes, James Frazer, and Thorstein Veblen.[71] These influenced her ethnographic style of novelization.[71] Wharton developed a passion for Walt Whitman.[72]\\nSource: Campbell, Donna M. \"Works by Edith Wharton\".

Allen; Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Averil Ives, Anita Charles, Barbara Rowan, Jane Beaufort, Rose Burghley, Mary Whistler and Marguerite Bell. She has sold millions of copies over her 90-year career. She has been referred to as the \"world\\'s oldest novelist\" who was still active at 105 and continued writing until her death.[2] On the occasion of her 105th birthday, Pollock was appointed honorary vice-president of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association, having been one of its founding members.[3]\\nIda and her husband, Lt Colonel Hugh Alexander Pollock, DSO (1888–1971), a veteran of war and Winston Churchill\\'s collaborator and editor, had a daughter, Rosemary Pollock, who was also a romance writer. Ida\\'s autobiography, Starlight, published in 2009 at 100 years, tells the story of the start of her career, her marriage, and the relation of her husband with his ex-wife Enid Blyton. She was also an oil painter, who was selected for inclusion in a national exhibition in 2004, at the age of 96.[4]\\nBorn Ida Julia Crowe on 12 April 1908 in Lewisham, Kent, England,[5] she was the daughter of Fanny Osborn, whose father was an architect in Victorian London, and her husband Arthur Crowe, but Pollock claimed to be illegitimate.[6] Still unmarried, her mother began an affair with a supposed Russian duke, but, after her parents\\' death, her mother married Arthur Crowe, an old widower with a distant connection to Lord Nelson. A year or so later her mother resumed her affair with her Russian lover and became pregnant, but her daughter obtained her husband\\'s surname.[6] Her mother lived alone when Pollock was born, and she narrowly escaped being smothered with a pillow by the nurse who attended her birth.[7] Her mother had a difficult time raising her and she was almost adopted by a rich uncle.[6] Encouraged by her mother, she began to write while still at school. At 14, she published her first thriller, The Hills of Raven\\'s Haunt.[citation needed]\\nAt age 20, she was living with her mother in Hastings and already had several stories in major magazines and short novels in print.[8] She visited George Newnes\\'s office in London, to sell her first full-length manuscript;[7] Palanquins and Coloured Lanterns, a novel set in 1920s Shanghai.[8] Six months later, she discovered they had mislaid it.[9] After they found it, she returned to London to meet one of its editors, the 39-year-old Hugh Alexander Pollock (1888–1971), a distinguished veteran of World War I. Hugh had been married since 1924 to his second wife, the popular children\\'s writer Enid Blyton, and was divorced from his first wife, Marion Atkinson, with whom he had two sons, William Cecil Alexander (1914–16) and Edward Alistair (1915–69). George Newnes bought her manuscript and contracted with her to write two more novels.[7] She became a full-time writer in the 1930s, writing short stories under pseudonyms. Ida decided to travel alone to Morocco, after suffering a mental breakdown.[7]\\nDuring World War II, Ida worked at a hostel for girls in London during the Blitz; at this time Hugh, who had left publishing to join the Army, was Commandant of a school for Home Guard officers.[10] Hugh had two daughters with Enid Blyton, Gillian Mary (later Baverstock; 1931–2007) and Imogen Mary (later Smallwood; born 1935), but his marriage had difficulties and his wife began a series of affairs. He offered Ida a post as civilian secretary at the Army Training Centre in the Surrey Hills. During a bungled firearms training session on a firing range, Hugh was hit by shrapnel and Ida contacted Enid, who declined to visit her husband because she was busy and hated hospitals.[7]\\nIn 1941, Enid met Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters, a London surgeon with whom she began another relationship, and the marriage had broken down. In May 1942, while Ida was visiting her mother\\'s home in Hastings a bomb destroyed the house. She escaped unhurt, but her mother was in hospital for two weeks.[7] Hugh paid for Ida to stay at Claridges and he said he was divorcing his wife. To get a quick divorce, Hugh blamed himself for adultery at divorce petition. On 26 October 1943 Ida and Hugh were married at London\\'s Guildhall Register Office, six days after Enid\\'s marriage to Darrell Waters. In 1944 they had a daughter Rosemary Pollock who has also become a romance writer. Enid changed the names of their daughters and Hugh did not see them again, although Enid had promised access as part of his taking the blame for the divorce.[citation needed]\\nAfter World War II, George Newnes, Hugh\\'s old firm, decided not to work with him anymore. They also represented Enid Blyton and were not willing to let her go. After this the marriage experienced financial problems and, in 1950, Hugh had to declare bankruptcy while he struggled with alcoholism. Ida decided to write popular contemporary romances and sold her first novel to Mills & Boon in 1952. Being in print with several major international publishers at the same time, she decided to use multiple pseudonyms. In the 1950s she wrote as Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Rose Burghley, and Mary Whistler to Mills & Boon; as Averil Ives and Barbara Rowan to Ward Lock; as Anita Charles to Wright & Brown; and as Jane Beaufort to Collins. In 1964, she published under her married name, Ida Pollock, her first historical novel, The Gentle Masquerade, and after the success of it, Mills and Boon\\'s \"Masquerade\" series of historical romances was launched.[8] Under her last pseudonym, Marguerite Bell, she also wrote historical romances. Most of her novels have been reprinted by Mills & Boon (or Harlequin in the United States).\\nDuring her marriage she travelled widely and lived in many parts of England. It was their daughter\\'s asthma that brought the Pollocks to Cornwall. They also lived in Ireland, France, Italy, Malta and Switzerland, where they successfully obtained a lasting cure for Rosemary\\'s debilitating condition.[7] Hugh died on 8 November 1971 in Malta, where he is buried in the British military cemetery. After her husband\\'s death, Pollock returned with her daughter to England and they lived for several years in Wiltshire, before moving to Lanreath in 1986. In the 1970s she slowed the rhythm of publication, but continued to write. Besides romances, she published – as Barbara Rowan – a suspense novel, and her novel, A Distant Drum (2005), is based around the Battle of Waterloo. She has been referred to as the \"world\\'s oldest novelist\" who was still active at 105.[11] After her death, her medieval story: Sir Faintheart was published in 2015, and there are still at least two unpublished Regency romances pending publication, including The Runaway.[2]  Today many of her old novels are being reedited.\\nIn addition to writing, Ida constructed model houses, usually scale miniatures of Georgian or Tudor buildings. She was also an oil painter, who was selected for inclusion in a national exhibition in 2004, at the age of 96.[8] But her sight deteriorated and she returned to writing.\\nAfter her 100th birthday, her autobiography, Starlight, was published on 15 November 2009, and she tells the story of the start of her career, her marriage, and the relation of her husband with his ex-wife Enid Blyton.\\nIn 1960 she was a founding member of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association, and in 2010 she helped in its 50th anniversary.[7] On the occasion of her 105th birthday, she was appointed its honorary vice-president.\\nShe died 3 December 2013, aged 105.[12]\\n(* Novels reedited as Ida Pollock)\\n(* Novels reedited as Ida Pollock)\\n',\n",

       " '\\nKathleen Winsor (October 16, 1919 – May 26, 2003) was an American author. She is best known for her first work, the 1944 historical novel Forever Amber. The novel, racy for its time, became a runaway bestseller even as it drew criticism from some authorities for its depictions of sexuality. She wrote seven other novels, none of which matched the success of her debut.\\nWinsor was born October 16, 1919, in Olivia, Minnesota, but raised in Berkeley, California.[1] Her father was a real-estate dealer.\\nAt the age of 18, Winsor made a list of her goals for life. Among those was her hope to write a best-selling novel.[2]\\nWinsor graduated in 1938 from the University of California, Berkeley.[3] During her school years, she married a fellow student, All-American college football player Robert Herwig. In 1937, she began writing a thrice-weekly sports column for the Oakland Tribune. Although that job only lasted a year, Winsor remained at the newspaper, working as a receptionist. She was fired in 1938 when the newspaper chose to trim its workforce.[4]\\nWinsor became interested in the Restoration period through her husband. Herwig was writing a paper for school on Charles II, and, out of boredom, Winsor read one of his research books.[1]\\nHer husband joined the military at the outbreak of World War II and spent five years with the United States Marines fighting in the Pacific theatre.[2] During that time, Winsor studied the Restoration period, claiming to have read 356 books on the subject. She began writing a novel based on her research. Her fifth draft of the novel was accepted for publication. The publishers promptly edited the book down to one-fifth of its original size. The resulting novel, Forever Amber, was 972 pages long.[1] The novel took readers on a frolic through Restoration England and offered vivid images of fashion, politics, affairs and public disasters of the time, including the plague and the Great Fire of London.\\nThe book appeared in 1944. It attracted criticism for its blatant sexual references.[3] Fourteen U.S. states banned it as pornography and the Hays Office also condemned it, but within a month the movie rights had been purchased by Twentieth Century Fox.[3] The film, directed by Otto Preminger and starring Linda Darnell and Cornel Wilde, was released in 1947.[1]\\nDespite being banned, Forever Amber became one of the bestselling American novels of the 1940s.[5] It sold over 100,000\\xa0copies in its first week of release, and went on to sell over three million copies.[1]\\nMade a celebrity by the success of her novel, Winsor found it unthinkable to return to the married life she had known with Herwig and, in 1946, they divorced. Ten days later, she became the sixth wife of the big-band leader and clarinetist Artie Shaw, despite the fact that two years previously Shaw had castigated his then-wife, Ava Gardner, for reading such a \"trashy novel\" as Forever Amber.[1][4] The marriage to Shaw ended in 1948, and Winsor soon married her divorce attorney, Arnold Krakower. That marriage likewise ended in divorce, in 1953.[1][4] In 1956 Winsor married for the fourth time, to Paul A. Porter, a former head of the Federal Communications Commission. They remained married until Porter\\'s death in 1975.[2]\\nWinsor\\'s next commercially successful novel, Star Money, appeared in 1950, and was a portrait closely drawn from her experience of becoming a bestselling author. But in five subsequent novels, the last appearing in 1986 – The Lovers, Calais, Robert and Arabella, Jacintha, and Wanderers Eastward, Wanderers West – she failed to make as much of an impact. In 2000 a new edition of Forever Amber was published with a foreword by Barbara Taylor Bradford.[4]\\nWinsor died May 26, 2003, in New York City.[1]\\nWinsor\\'s manuscripts and research from 1940-1949 are at The Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin.[6]\\n',\n",

Presents line books were more sexually explicit than the previous line, Romance, under which Winspear had been published. She was chosen to be a launch author because she, along with Anne Mather and Anne Hampson were the most popular and prolific British authors of Mills and Boon.[1]\\nIn 1970, Winspear commented that she wrote her leading males as if they were \\'capable of rape\\'. This comment caused uproar and led to her receiving hate mail.[2]\\nViolet Winspear was born on 28 April 1928 in London, England. She worked in a factory since 1942, when in 1961 she sold her first romance novels to Mills & Boon. In 1963, she became a full-time writer.[3] She wrote from her home in the South East England, an area which she never left, but she researched her far-flung settings at the local library. She said: \"The real aim of romance is to provide escape and entertainment\", but when in 1970 she commented: \"I get my heroes so that they\\'re lean and hard muscled and mocking and sardonic and tough and tigerish and single, of course. Oh and they\\'ve got to be rich and then I make it that they\\'re only cynical and smooth on the surface. But underneath they\\'re well, you know, sort of lost and lonely. In need of love but, when roused, capable of breathtaking passion and potency. Most of my heroes, well all of them really, are like that. They frighten but fascinate. They must be the sort of men who are capable of rape: men it\\'s dangerous to be alone in the room with\". The comment that they were \"capable of rape\" caused uproar and lead to her receiving hate mail. She never married, and had no children, but she inspired her nephew Jonathan to write.\\nViolet Winspear died at January 1989 after a long battle with cancer.\\nWinspear\\'s novels take the readers around the world. Even though many of her storylines are uninspiring, she excels at boldly using the written words to vividly bring to life the surroundings of her plots. For example, The Palace of the Peacocks (1969). Many established Harlequin novelists such as Robyn Donald and Kay Thorpe, employ sexual antagonism in developing conflict in their stories. These devices are popular with modern readers. For instance, Robyn Donald creates leaping sexual awareness between men and women. Since men are quick to acknowledge this vital force, Robyn casts them into the role of hunter and as women label it as a weakness to despise and overcome, she makes them the prey. This is the adversarial set up that drives her plots forward. Employing the same motif of sexual antagonism, critics say that Winspear, contrasts her hero and heroine in such extremes that the heroine lacks awareness of her own sexuality against the hero who is fully aware of his. This lends her stories an acute imbalance in character development where the heroine is left bemused with an alpha male hero who exerts overwhelming control over every situation.\\nIn 1983, Takarazuka Snow Troupe staged Blue Jasmine.\\n',\n",

       " 'Kathleen E. Woodiwiss (born Kathleen Erin Hogg, June 3, 1939 – July 6, 2007) was an American novelist. She pioneered the historical romance genre with the 1972 publication of her novel The Flame and the Flower.\\nShe was born Kathleen Erin Hogg in Alexandria, Louisiana, the youngest of eight children of Charles Wingrove Hogg, a disabled World War I veteran, and his wife, Gladys, née Coker.[1] As a child, she relished creating her own stories, and by age six, was telling herself stories at night to help fall asleep.[2][3]  Her father died suddenly when Woodiwiss was only 12, leaving her to be raised by her mother and older sisters. Woodiwiss would later remark that, \"every single one of us had minds of our own even then; I was no exception. I suppose that carried over into my creations of heroines who weren\\'t weak-willed.\"[3]\\nAt age 16, she met U.S. Air Force Second Lieutenant Ross Eugene Woodiwiss at a dance.[2] They married the following year, on July 20, 1956.[1] She attended school locally and graduated in 1957. Her husband\\'s military career led them to live in Japan, where she worked part-time as a fashion model for an American-owned modeling agency.  After over three years in Japan, the family moved to Topeka, Kansas and then settled in Minnesota.[1] During these years, she attempted to write a novel several times, but each time stopped in frustration at the slow pace of writing in longhand. After buying her husband an electric typewriter as a Christmas present, she appropriated the machine to begin her novel in earnest.[3]\\nHer debut novel, The Flame and the Flower, was rejected by agents and hardcover publishers as being too long at 600 pages. Rather than follow the advice of the rejection letters and rewrite the novel, Woodiwiss instead submitted it to paperback publishers. The first publisher on her list, Avon, quickly purchased the novel. Editor Nancy Coffey provided a $1500 advance and arranged for an initial 500,000 print run.[2] The Flame and the Flower was revolutionary, featuring an epic historical romance with a strong heroine and actual sex scenes. This novel, published in 1972, sold over 2.3 million copies in its first four years of publication and is credited with spawning the modern romance genre, becoming the first romance novel \"to [follow] the principals into the bedroom.\"[4][5][6] The success of this novel prompted a new style of writing romance, concentrating primarily on historical fiction tracking the monogamous relationships between helpless heroines and the heroes who rescued them, even if they had been the ones to place them in danger.[7]  The romance novels which followed in her example featured longer plots, more controversial situations and characters, and more intimate and steamy sex scenes.[8]\\nWoodiwiss had a direct impact on the career of fellow novelist LaVyrle Spencer. Soon after finding her own success, Woodiwiss read a manuscript written by Spencer, who had yet to earn a publishing contract. Woodiwiss promptly mailed Spencer\\'s novel to her own editor at Avon. The editor purchased the novel, The Fulfillment, beginning Spencer\\'s career.[9] In addition, many modern romance novelists cite Woodiwiss as their inspiration. Julia Quinn remarked that \"Woodiwiss made women want to read. She gave them an alternative to Westerns and hard-boiled police procedurals. When I was growing up, I saw my mother and grandmother reading and enjoying romances, and when I was old enough to read them myself, I felt as if I had been admitted into a special sisterhood of reading women.\"[8][10]\\nWoodiwiss published twelve best-selling romance novels, with over thirty-six million copies in print.[1] Woodiwiss was known for the quality of her novels rather than the quantity of works she published. She often took four to five years to write a single novel. In some cases, Woodiwiss attributed the lag in publication time to personal and health issues, while in others she confessed to having suffered burnout and needing a rest to recover her interest in writing.[3]\\nAll of her novels were historical romances set in varied backgrounds, including the American Civil War, 18th-century England, or Saxony in the time of William the Conqueror.[2]  The heroines of the novels are strong-willed young women with \"a spark of life and determination.\"[3]  Woodiwiss describes her novels as \"fairy tales.  They are an escape for the reader, like an Errol Flynn movie.\"[2]\\nWoodiwiss was an avid equestrienne who at one time lived in a large house on 55 acres (220,000\\xa0m2) in Minnesota. After her husband\\'s death in 1996, she moved back to Louisiana. She died in a hospital in Princeton, Minnesota, aged 68, from cancer.[11]\\nShe was survived by two sons, Sean and Heath, their wives, and numerous grandchildren. A third son, Dorren, predeceased her.[1] Her final book, Everlasting, was released on October 30, 2007.\\nLaura Kinsale in her essay \"The Androgynous Reader\" in Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women cites the heroine of Shanna as proof that the average romance reader is not identifying with the heroine, but rather as a placeholder for themselves to be with the hero, for a \"sillier and more wrongheaded heroine than Shanna would be difficult to imagine...Feminists need not tremble for the reader--she does not identify with, admire, or internalize the characteristics of either a stupidly submissive or an irksomely independent heroine. The reader thinks about what she would have done in the heroine\\'s place.\"[12]\\n',\n",

In between raising her five children, she wrote many more novels.[2]\\nShe began her writing career as her married name Sheila Holland and as her maiden name Sheila Coates. In 1973 she signed Follow a Stranger as her most famous pseudonym: Charlotte Lamb, but later she used several other pseudonyms, among them Sheila Lancaster, Victoria Woolf and Laura Hardy.\\nHer first historical and romantic novels were published by Robert Hale and serialised in Woman\\'s Weekly Digest. By the late 1970s, she was an established and successful author, publishing as many as twelve novels a year with Mills and Boon. That annual number rose over the next few years; by the late 1990s, she had published over 160 novels, most of them romances, others historical novels and romantic thrillers, achieving over 200 million sales worldwide. During the course of her career, she wrote for a variety of different international publishers including: Penguin, Collins, Fontana, Hodder & Stoughton, Hodder Headline and Simon & Schuster.\\nKnown for her swiftness, literary style and versatility, Sheila Holland was able to write in several different genres – hence her plethora of pseudonyms as well as publishers. She typically wrote a minimum of two thousand words per day, working from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. While she once finished a full-length novel in four days, she herself pegged her average speed at two weeks to complete a full novel.[3]\\nShe was a true revolutionary in the field of romance writing. One of the first writers to explore the boundaries of sexual desire, her novels often reflected the forefront of the \"sexual revolution\" of the 1970s. Her books touched on then-taboo subjects such as child abuse and rape, and she created sexually confident -even dominant- heroines. She was also one of the first to create a modern romantic heroine: independent, imperfect, and perfectly capable of initiating a sexual or romantic relationship.[3]\\nHer last novel, a romantic thriller published posthumously with Hodder & Stoughton, was entitled The Angel of Death.\\n(Same titles as Sheila Holland)\\n',\n",

She wrote under her first married name and under the pen-names: Denise Chesterton, Eve Vaill, \\'Anne Llewellyn\\', Hervey Hamilton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray and Julia Kane, producing short stories, plays, and about 170 Gothic romance novels. In 1965, Robins published her autobiography, Stranger Than Fiction. At the time of her death in 1985, Robins\\'s books had been translated into fifteen languages and had sold more than one hundred million copies. In 1984, they were borrowed more than one and a half million times from British libraries.[2]\\nShe was the daughter of the novelist K. C. Groom, and mother of romance novelist Patricia Robins. Some other members of her family are well-known artists.\\nRobins was born Denise Naomi Klein on 1 February 1897 in London, England, the daughter of Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell, who was also a prolific author who wrote under several names, and of her first husband, Herman Klein, who was a professor of music and journalist. Of Russian Jewish ancestry, he had been born in Norwich in 1856. Her mother Kathleen Clarice had been born in Melbourne, Australia, on 11 March 1872 and was the daughter of George Cornwell and his wife Jemima Ridpath, married in 1850.[3] George Cornwell was a railway guard who became a successful gold prospector in Australia, operating several mines, and a notable building contractor. His eldest daughter, Alice Cornwell, born 1852, was spectacularly rich by the 1890s, returning to England and buying the Sunday Times newspaper.[4][5]\\nHer parents had married in 1890. He had a daughter Sibyl Klein, from a previous marriage, and they had two sons: Adrian Bernard Klein (1892–1969) and Daryl Klein (1894), before the birth of Denise Naomi Klein (1897–1985). The childhood of Denise, Adrian and Daryl Klein was far from settled. Kathleen Klein began an affair with a Worcestershire Regiment officer called Herbert Berkeley Dealtry, who was much younger than her husband, and little than herself, and when Hermann Klein became aware of it he filed a petition for divorce, which was granted in December 1901. Kathleen then married Dealtry.[4]\\nIn 1905, the Dealtrys had some serious troubles in connection with the promotion of dog shows, which they had been drawn into by Kathleen\\'s sister Alice Stennard Robinson, a leading member of the Ladies\\' Kennel Association (founded 1904) and the National Cat Club. Somehow, the money from the first dog show went missing, and the Dealtrys held a second show to pay the prize money owed on the first. After the second show, prize winners sued Dealtry, which led to his being declared bankrupt.[4] The family then lived in America for a few years but, by 1908, Kathleen (or \\'Kit\\') Dealtry was back in London, writing Christian novels.[6] In 1918 she married for a third time and wrote at least three books[7] as Mrs Sydney Groom.[4]\\nHer eldest brother Adrian Bernard Klein also became a writer, he was an artist and wrote books on photography and cinematography. After serving as an officer in the British Army, he became a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and changed his name to Adrian Cornwell-Clyne.[4]\\nDenise Naomi Klein married firstly Arthur Robins in 1918, a corn broker on the Baltic Exchange,[8] they had three daughters, Eve Louise, Patricia Robins (a.k.a. Claire Lorrimer) who became another best-selling author, and Anne Eleanor.[8] In 1938, the marriage ended in divorce, after Robins met O\\'Neill Pearson in Egypt,[9] they married in 1939. However, like Agatha Christie, Robins continued to publish most of her books under her first married name.[1]\\nWhen she left school, Denise Klein went to work as a journalist for the D. C. Thomson Press, then became a freelance writer. She began to follow in her mother\\'s footsteps when her first novel was published in 1924. Her serial What is Love? ran in The Star from December 1925 to February 1926.[10] Her first play, Heatwave, written in collaboration with Roland Pertwee, was produced at the St James\\'s Theatre, London, in 1929.[11] As a writer of fiction, Denise Klein wrote under a variety of pen-names, including Denise Chesterton, Francesca Wright, Ashley French, Harriet Gray, Hervey Hamilton and Julia Kane.[1] After marrying Arthur Robins, many of her books were written under her married name.[11]\\nRobins had been writing fiction and getting it published for ten years when in 1927 she met Charles Boon, of Mills & Boon, and she entered her first contract with his firm the same year. Under the terms of this, she was to be paid an advance of thirty pounds for three novels, plus ten per cent terms. Her next contract, for a further six books, delivered an advance of twenty-five pounds for each book, while her third contract, for four more books, paid one hundred pounds for each, plus terms of twelve and a half per cent.[12]\\nThe colourful dust wrappers of Mills & Boon\\'s books were becoming one of their biggest selling points. As an example, the cover of Robins\\'s Women Who Seek (1928) showed a glamorous flapper checking her make-up.[13]\\n\\nRobins became not only Mills & Boon\\'s most prolific writer, but also their best paid. A contract she signed in 1932 paid her £2,400 for eight books, which were those from Shatter the Sky (July 1933) to How Great the Price (June 1935). This was, however, her last work for the firm, as she was then \\'poached\\' by a new publisher, Nicholson & Watson.[14] Of this development, Arthur Boon wrote:[14] Denise Robins, one of our greatest authors, knew she could sell on her name more than other authors could. She was a superstar, and she knew it. Our problem was to find a way to satisfy the superstar. What could Mills & Boon offer a superstar? Superstars weren\\'t grateful.\\nRobins gave her version of events in her autobiography:[11][14] Suddenly a young man named Ivor Nicholson came along – a clever, charming journalist who, with the wealth of Bernard Watson to back his new venture, launched a new publishing house – Ivor Nicholson & Watson. They wanted my name on their list. They tempted me with what was the biggest offer I had ever received from any literary quarter, a cheque for one thousand pounds, free, gratis, and for which I need do no work. It was merely for signing the contract! I did not go behind Charles Boon\\'s back. I told him the facts. Unfortunately he was so annoyed by Ivor Nicholson\\'s offer that he refused to compete and at once released me from my contract with his firm. Somewhat reluctantly I left my old publishers and became the new Nicholson & Watson \\'star\\' author.The first book Robins wrote for Nicholson was Life and Love (1935), which was launched with a huge publicity campaign. Robins\\'s first photo opportunity was a visit to Liverpool to open a new lending library, and the slogan \\'Robins for Romance\\' was posted on London buses.[14]\\nJoseph McAleer has described Robins as \"the recognised mistress of the punishing kiss device.[15]\\nDuring her long career as a writer, from about 1917 until her death in 1985, Robins certainly wrote more than one hundred and sixty books. She was dubbed by the Daily Graphic \"the queen of romantic fiction\".[4]\\nShe was elected as President of the Romantic Novelists\\' Association in 1961.[9]\\nIn 1965, Robins published her autobiography, Stranger Than Fiction, summarised thus: \"Apart from writing nearly two hundred novels that have brought her millions of fans throughout the world, Denise Robins led a remarkable life. Her unhappy childhood did not sour her belief in love. Here is her own story.\"[16][17]\\nAt the time of her death in 1985, Robins\\'s books had been translated into fifteen languages and had sold more than one hundred million copies. In 1984, they were borrowed more than one and a half million times from British libraries. Among her best-selling works were House of the Seventh Cross, Khamsin and Dark Corridor.[2] In October 2011 the first dozen of her novels were released in e-book format.[18]\\nSome of her novels have been reedited under different titles or as Denise Robins[17]\\n',\n",

She was raised in Washington, D.C., she earned a B.A. in American Thought and Civilization from George Washington University and an M.A. in American Studies from the University of Maryland.  On 30 June 1963, she married Norman S. Glick, a mathematician for the Defense Department. They have two children: Elissa, a librarian, and Ethan, a Foreign Service Officer.\\nAfter several years as a stay-at-home mother, Glick decided to pursue a career.  She enrolled in a course at a local community college to help her choose a career.  The class helped her identify a talent for writing.  For the next few years, Glick wrote articles for local newspapers, and sold several articles on a freelance basis to The Washington Post and the Baltimore Sun.[2]\\nIn 1977, Glick published a book about making dollhouse furniture with her friend Nancy Baggett.

Her novels and short stories have drawn from and re-worked classic subgenres of crime writing from a female perspective.[2][3] She is also an American writer and producer of television.\\nGrowing up, Abbott was greatly intrigued by the 1930 and 1940s movies she saw at a movie theater in Grosse Pointe. She believes that watching these films as a child gave her her lifelong interest in crime fiction.[4] Abbott graduated from the University of Michigan.[5] She received her Ph.D. in English and American literature from New York University, and has taught at NYU, the State University of New York and the New School University. In 2013 and 2014, she served as the John Grisham Writer in Residence at the University of Mississippi.[6]\\nIn 2002, Abbott published her first book, The Street Was Mine: White Masculinity in Hardboiled Fiction and Film Noir, which The Paris Review described as \"a prescient work of critical theory.\"[7] In it, Abbott challenges the archetypes of the \"tough guy\" and \"femme fatale\" common to noir literature.[8]\\nThree years later, Abbott published Die a Little,[9] the first of several novels presenting woman-centered takes on traditional noir tropes.[7] Set in midcentury Los Angeles, the story centered on Lora King, a schoolteacher whose brother Bill falls in love with Alice Steele, a former costumer for the film industry. Suspicious of Alice\\'s motives and jealous of her hold over Bill, Lora sets out to investigate Alice\\'s background, only to find herself pulled into the dark side of Hollywood.

She wrote the plot outlines for many books in the Nancy Drew series, using characters invented by her father, Edward Stratemeyer. Adams also oversaw other ghostwriters who wrote for these and many other series as a part of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, and rewrote many of the novels to update them starting in the late 1950s.\\nWith her sister, Edna, Adams took over control of the Stratemeyer Syndicate after her father Edward Stratemeyer\\'s death in 1930.[1]  Edna ran the daily business operations, while Adams dealt with publishers and wrote; Edna became inactive when she married in 1942, and Adams took over the business.[1] Adams is credited with keeping the Syndicate afloat through the Great Depression, and with revising the two most popular series, Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, in the 1950s and 1960s, removing stereotypes and streamlining plots and characters. She ran the Syndicate for 52 years.[1]\\nThe extremely popular Nancy Drew books were the brainchild of Adams\\'s father, who created the characters of a sixteen-year-old sleuth, her lawyer father, and their housekeeper. Later, Nancy\\'s age was increased to eighteen to give her more independence. Adams came up with plot ideas and hired ghostwriters to flesh them out. The best-known books were written primarily by Mildred Wirt Benson,[2] all published under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. Adams outlined a few in the Hardy Boys series, which were published under the pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon.  Although Adams claimed to write all the Nancy Drew books entirely by herself during her lifetime, it is well established that Wirt and 28 other authors did the actual writing, following Adams\\'s ideas and embellishing on them. Adams touched up the completed manuscripts.[3]\\nHarriet Stratemeyer was born in Newark, New Jersey, on December 12, 1892, the daughter of Edward Stratemeyer and Magdalena Van Camp.[4] At a young age, Adams wanted to break free from being a \"proper, young lady who should stay at home\". She climbed trees, made friends with local boys, and loved books from an early age.  Adams graduated from Wellesley College in 1914. Her father forbade her to work outside the estate, so she edited manuscripts at home.[1] In 1915, she married Russell Vroom Adams, and raised four children, becoming involved in the family business only after her father\\'s death.[1]  She resided in Maplewood, New Jersey, and in Pottersville, New Jersey, an area within Tewksbury Township.[5] \\nShe lived in Pottersville at her estate, Bird Haven New Jersey and died of a heart attack while watching The Wizard of Oz for the first time.[6]\\nAdams was interred in the Stratemeyer crypt[7] in Fairmount Cemetery in Newark.[8]\\n',\n",

In 1999 she was awarded an MBE for her services to children\\'s literature.[2] For The Whispering Mountain, published by Jonathan Cape in 1968, she won the Guardian Children\\'s Fiction Prize, a book award judged by a panel of British children\\'s writers,[3] and she was a commended runner-up for the Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year\\'s best children\\'s book by a British writer.[4][a] She won an Edgar Allan Poe Award (1972) for Night Fall.\\nAiken was born in Mermaid Street in Rye, Sussex, on 4 September 1924.[1] Her father was the American Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Conrad Aiken (1889–1973). Her older brother was the writer and research chemist[5] John Aiken (1913–1990), and her older sister was the writer Jane Aiken Hodge (1917–2009). Their mother, Canadian-born Jessie MacDonald (1889–1970), was a Master\\'s graduate from Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Jessie and Conrad\\'s marriage was dissolved in 1929, and Jessie married the English writer Martin Armstrong in 1930. Conrad Aiken went on to marry twice more. Together with her brother John and her sister Jane, Joan Aiken wrote Conrad Aiken Remembered (1989), a short appreciation of their father.\\nAiken was taught at home by her mother until the age of twelve and from 1936 to 1940 at Wychwood School for girls in North Oxford. She did not attend university. Writing stories from an early age, she finished her first full-length novel when she was sixteen and had her first short story for adults accepted for publication when she was seventeen.[citation needed] In 1941 her first children\\'s story was broadcast on the BBC\\'s Children\\'s Hour.[6]\\nAiken worked for the United Nations Information Centre (UNIC) in London between 1943 and 1949. In September 1945 she married Ronald George Brown,[1] a journalist who was also working at UNIC. They had two children before he died in 1955.\\nAfter her husband\\'s death, Aiken joined the magazine Argosy, where she worked in various editorial capacities and, she later said, learned her trade as a writer. The magazine was one of many in which she published short stories between 1955 and 1960. During this time she also published her first two collections of children\\'s stories and began work on a children\\'s novel, initially titled Bonnie Green, which was later published in 1962 as The Wolves of Willoughby Chase. By then she was able to write full-time from home, producing two or three books a year for the rest of her life, mainly children\\'s books and thrillers, as well as many articles, introductions and talks on children\\'s literature and on the work of Jane Austen.\\nAiken married, secondly, to the New York landscape painter and teacher Julius Goldstein (died 2001) in 1976. They divided their time between her home (the Hermitage in Petworth, Sussex) and his native New York. In September 1999, she was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire. Aiken died at home at the age of 79 in 2004. She was survived by her two children.[1]\\nAiken produced more than 100 books, including more than a dozen collections of fantasy stories, plays and poems, and modern and historical novels for adults and children. She was a lifelong fan of ghost stories, particularly those of M. R. James, Fitz James O\\'Brien and Nugent Barker.[citation needed] As well as writing under her own name, she used the pen name Nicholas Dee for several short stories. Some of her books focus on spine-chilling or supernatural events, including The Windscreen Weepers (stories, 1969), The Shadow Guests (novel, 1980), A Whisper in the Night (stories, 1982), and A Creepy Company (stories, 1993, with variant contents in its US and UK editions). She set her adult supernatural novel The Haunting of Lamb House at Lamb House in Rye (now a National Trust property). This ghost story recounts in fictional form an alleged haunting experienced by two former residents of the house, Henry James and E. F. Benson, both of whom also wrote ghost stories.\\nMany of Aiken\\'s most popular books, including the Wolves Chronicles[7] (also known as The Wolves of Willoughby Chase series or the James III series), are set in an elaborate alternative history of Britain in which James II was never deposed in the Glorious Revolution, but supporters of the House of Hanover continually agitate against the monarchy. These books also toy with the geography of London, adding a Canal District among other features. Wolves have invaded the country from Europe via the newly built Channel Tunnel. The novels share a varying cast and a variety of interlinked child protagonists—initially Bonnie Green, but subsequently her itinerant friend Simon, Simon\\'s intrepid Cockney friend Dido Twite (the heroine of most of the books), Dido\\'s half-sister Is and Owen Hughes (son of Dido\\'s Royal Navy ally Captain Hughes). In a review of Midwinter Nightingale for the School Library Journal, Susan Patron praised the characterisations and the suspenseful plot and noted that \"although the titles in the \\'Wolves\\' series may be read independently\", readers may want to read the earlier books first.[8]\\nAiken\\'s series of children\\'s books about Arabel and Mortimer were illustrated by Quentin Blake. Others were illustrated by Jan Pieńkowski and Pat Marriott. Pieńkowski won the foremost British award for children\\'s book illustration, the Greenaway Medal, for The Kingdom Under the Sea and Other Stories (Jonathan Cape, 1971), a collection of \"unique fairy tales from Eastern Europe and Russia\" retold by Aiken.[9] She participated in the Puffin Book Club\\'s annual Children\\'s Literature Summer Camp, run by Colony Holidays, predecessor to ATE Superweeks, along with other popular children\\'s authors such as Ian Serraillier and Clive King.[10] Her novels for adults include several that continue or complement novels by Jane Austen. These include Mansfield Revisited and Jane Fairfax.\\nTwo of Joan Aiken\\'s stories from her 1968 collection A Necklace of Raindrops were adapted into animated short films by director Tatyana Mititella at Soyuzmultfilm studio in the Soviet Union:\\nThe Wolves Chronicles vary in length from less than 150 pages to more than 250 pages.[7] Here the novels are listed in narrative order, and their central characters.\\nThis novel evidently takes place in the same fictional world as the series. Blastburn, the fictional setting of this work, features as the location of Mrs. Brisket\\'s orphanage in The Wolves of Willoughby Chase, but does not otherwise bring elements of the other books. Its setting and time period resemble and satirise the height of the Victorian manufacturing years, rather than the Georgian setting of the other books. \"Joan Aiken follows all the conventions of Dickensian fiction with just a little extra to satisfy jaded contemporary tastes.

She played down this part of her career, commenting in 1979 that prior to that she \"had been a writer, a columnist for Life magazine and for Newsweek -- that was about as high as you could get in column writing. I care about my writing. I\\'m not a quack-quack TV journalist.\"[5]\\nStill, the debates Alexander had with Kilpatrick were so prominent in American culture that they were famously satirized on Saturday Night Live, with Jane Curtin taking Alexander\\'s role on the “Weekend Update\" segment opposite Dan Aykroyd\\'s version of Kilpatrick, arguing two sides of a topic in the news.  Aykroyd opened his segment with the now-infamous line, \"Jane, you ignorant slut.\"[1][9]\\nShe also wrote a number of non-fiction books, including Anyone\\'s Daughter, a biography of kidnapped heiress Patricia Hearst.

       " '\\nMargery Louise Allingham (20 May 1904 – 30 June 1966) was an English novelist from the \"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\", and considered one of its four \"Queens of Crime\", alongside Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers and Ngaio Marsh. \\nAllingham is best remembered for her hero, the gentleman sleuth Albert Campion. Initially believed to be a parody of Dorothy L. Sayers\\'s detective Lord Peter Wimsey, Campion matured into a strongly individual character, part-detective, part-adventurer, who formed the basis for 18 novels and many short stories.\\nMargery Louise Allingham was born on 20 May 1904 in Ealing, London, the eldest daughter of Herbert John (1868-1936) and Emily Jane (née Hughes; 1879-1960). She had a younger brother Philip William, and a younger sister Emily Joyce Allingham, former WRENS member and amateur filmmaker.[1][2] Her family was immersed in literature; her parents were both writers. Her father was editor of the Christian Globe and The New London Journal, to which Margery later contributed articles and Sexton Blake stories, and he had become a successful pulp fiction writer, and her mother, as Emmie Allingham, was a contributor of stories to women\\'s magazines. Soon after Margery\\'s birth the family left London for Essex, where they lived in an old house in Layer Breton, a village near Colchester. She attended a local school and then the Perse School for Girls in Cambridge, all the while writing stories and plays. She earned her first fee at the age of eight, for a story printed in her aunt\\'s magazine.[3]\\nUpon returning to London in 1920 she studied drama and speech training at Regent Street Polytechnic, which helped her manage a stammer which she had  since childhood. At this time she first met her future husband, Philip Youngman Carter, whom she married in 1927. He collaborated with her and designed the jackets for many of her books. They lived on the edge of the Essex Marshes in Tolleshunt D\\'Arcy, near Maldon.[3]\\nWhile she was enrolled at the Regent Street Polytechnic she wrote a verse play, Dido and Aeneas, which was performed at St. George\\'s Hall, London, and the Cripplegate Theatre, London. Allingham played the role of Dido and the scenery was designed by Philip Youngman Carter.[4]\\nHer first novel, Blackkerchief Dick, was published in 1923, when she was 19. It was allegedly based on a story she had heard during a séance, though later in life this was debunked by her husband. Nevertheless, Allingham continued to include occult themes in many of her novels. Blackkerchief Dick was well received, but was not a financial success. She wrote several plays in this period and attempted to write a serious novel, but finding that her themes clashed with her natural light-heartedness, she decided instead to try the mystery genre.\\nHer breakthrough occurred in 1929 with the publication of The Crime at Black Dudley. This introduced Albert Campion, initially as a minor character, thought to be a parody of Dorothy Sayers’s Lord Peter Wimsey.[5] Campion returned in Mystery Mile, thanks in part to pressure from her American publishers, who had been taken with the character.\\nWith a strong central character and a format to work in, she began to produce a series of Campion novels. At first she also continued writing short stories and articles for magazines such as The Strand Magazine, but as her Campion saga went on her sales grew steadily. Campion proved so successful that Allingham made him the centrepiece of another 17 novels and more than 20 short stories, continuing into the 1960s.[citation needed]\\nCampion is a mysterious upper-class character (early novels hint that his family is in the line of succession to the throne), working under an assumed name. He floats between the upper echelons of the nobility and government on the one hand, and the shady world of the criminal class on the other, often accompanied by his scurrilous ex-burglar servant Magersfontein Lugg. During the course of his career Campion is sometimes a detective, sometimes an adventurer.\\nThe first three Campion novels, The Crime at Black Dudley, Mystery Mile and Look to the Lady, were all written by what Allingham referred to as the \"plum pudding\" method, focused less on methods of murder or the formal strictures of the whodunit and more on mixing possibilities together.[6] As the series progresses, however, Campion comes to work more closely with the police and MI6 counter-intelligence.[7] He also falls in love, gets married and has a child, and as time goes by he grows in wisdom and matures emotionally.\\nThe style and format of the books moved on: while the early novels are light-hearted whodunnits or \"fantastical\" adventures,[7] The Tiger in the Smoke (1952) is more a character study than a crime novel, focusing on the serial killer Jack Havoc. In many of the later books Campion plays a subsidiary role, no more prominent than the roles of his wife Amanda and his police associates, and in the last novel he is a minor character.\\nIn 1941 Allingham published a non-fiction work, The Oaken Heart, which describes her experiences in Essex when an invasion from Germany was expected and actively being planned for, potentially placing the civilian population of Essex in the front line.[8]\\nAllingham suffered from breast cancer and died at Severalls Hospital, Colchester, England, on 30 June 1966, aged 62. Her final Campion novel, Cargo of Eagles, was completed by her husband at her request, and was published in 1968. She was cared for through her illness by her sister, who avoided the topic in her films depicting their home life as well as ensuring her husband was not inconvenienced by it.[9]\\nCompilations of her work, both with and without Albert Campion, continued to be released through the 1970s. The Margery Allingham Omnibus, comprising Sweet Danger, The Case of the Late Pig and The Tiger in the Smoke, with a critical introduction by Jane Stevenson, was published in 2006.[10]\\nAllingham was buried in the newer cemetery in Tolleshunt D\\'Arcy, which is across the road from the graveyard of St Nicholas\\'s Church and about half a mile to the south.\\nA film version of Tiger in the Smoke was made in 1956 and a highly popular series of Campion adaptations, now available on DVD, was shown by the BBC in 1989–90. It is titled simply Campion and stars Peter Davison as Campion and Brian Glover as Lugg.[11]\\nSeveral books have been written about Allingham and her work, including:\\nFurther Campion adventures have been written by Mike Ripley. The first of these, Mr Campion\\'s Farewell, was based on notes left at his death by Allingham\\'s husband Philip Youngman Carter; all the rest have been originals.\\n',\n",

Her father was an artist and art teacher and her mother, a teacher of English and comparative religions.[8] Since childhood, she had a passion for exploring the great outdoors, including sailing with her father and wandering solo through the woods and fields during the family\\'s long summers in rural Maine.\\nAndrews left New York to attend Colorado College.[1] In a creative writing class, she discovered that she \"had a knack for storytelling.\"[9] Later, inspired by her Aunt Lysbeth\\'s profession, Andrews selected a geology course to fulfill a science requirement. She found herself among people who thought the way she did, and that she even excelled \"taking in graphical information holistically, seeing the patterns, understanding their meaning, and making interpretations from them.\"[9] Her aptitude inspired her to earn a BA in geology.[9]\\nAfter college, Andrews stayed in Colorado, working first as a plumber\\'s apprentice on a construction site south of Colorado Springs. When kidded by coworkers about where her \"fancy education\" had gotten her, she happily taught them about the ancient seaway that had once existed in the area, sharing the fossils she had found up while digging for drain pipes that had been buried by the backhoe.[citation needed]\\nAndrews next took a job at the U.S. Geological Survey, working under legendary Grand Canyon geologist Edwin D. McKee from 1974 to 1980.[8][10]  In her work, she studied modern sand dunes in order to understand ancient sand dune rock formations.[9]\\nShe went on to earn a MS in Earth Resources from Colorado State University, studying with Frank Ethridge, then worked as a petroleum geologist with Amoco and ANGUS Petroleum.  After being laid off during the oil \"bust\" of 1986, she moved to California, where she worked as an environmental consultant, began to write, and lectured in the Geology Department at Sonoma State University.[1][2]\\nIn 2005, Andrews was awarded an Artists and Writers grant by the National Science Foundation and deployed through McMurdo Station, Antarctica to remote field camps to research an eleventh novel featuring fictional glaciologist Valena Walker.[11] Andrews has won numerous other awards for her writings, including the Geological Society of America President\\'s Medal and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists Journalism Award, now called the Geosciences in the Media Award.[1][12] Other of her awards include:[13]\\nShe, her husband, and son died in a private plane crash in Chadron, Nebraska, on 24 July 2019 on the way home from an air show in Wisconsin.[7] The NTSB identifies the \"pilot\\'s failure to ensure adequate fuel was on board before departing\" as the cause of the crash.[14] Andrews\\' life and works are memorialized[15] by the Geological Society of America.[16][circular reference] The Sarah Andrews Brown Papers are archived in the Special Collections of Charles L. Tutt Library,[17] Colorado College, Colorado Springs.\\nThe more interesting crimes are the ones that involve all of the characters in the stories, including the protagonist—and where things fall through the cracks.In one of her jobs as a geologist, Andrews entertained herself during dull meetings by \"picking someone across the table as a murder victim and then trying to figure out who killed him.\" These imaginings and her colleagues\\' positive reception of them led to her publishing mystery novels.[18]\\nThe white-collar crimes in Andrews\\' first three novels are drawn from real events that she or colleagues observed. The murders, on the other hand, are included for the drama.[19]\\nGeologist Gene Shinn \"worked for years on Andrews\" to incorporate into one of her novels his theory of dust floating from somewhere in Africa across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States. On September 11, 2001, she called his office, and the conversation inspired her book Killer Dust.[20]\\nAndrews cites Dorothy Sayers, Tony Hillerman, and Agatha Christie as favorite mystery writers.[19]\\nAlthough no two observations are precisely identical, we find that we can nonetheless categorize them, over time and through the accumulation of experience, into themes and variations.Beyond her careers as a geologist and a novelist, Andrews has reflected on geology itself from a number of angles.[21] Her whitepaper \"Spatial Thinking with a Difference: An Unorthodox Treatise on the Mind of the Geologist\" describes how she uses episodic simulation to understand past and future geologic events.[9][22][23] She has considered how geologists act as detectives and how her experience as a woman impacted her approach to geology.[24][25] And in a short note on geophilosophy, she points out that it is \"important to know that science involves not just the collection of facts, but also a variety of logics and reasonings, some of which vary from one division of science to another.\"[26]\\n',\n",
